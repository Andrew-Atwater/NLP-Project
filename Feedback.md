## Overall Feedback for Deliverable #2

The app __seems__ functional as of commit #e698fd. I would recommend creating an app folder and moving the necessary files (such as `pom.xml` and `src` folder) in the app folder. Ensure you have implemented some of the features of the app by the next deliverable.
