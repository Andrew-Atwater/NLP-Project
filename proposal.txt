NLP Project Proposal - Classification of Reviews
Lee, Drew, and Andrew

	Of the three NLP problem types listed, our group chose the classification type, where the user will upload a dataset 
    and our program will predict labels to classify those documents with. The domain we chose is in reviews, because we 
    would like to implement a feature that also sorts the reviews based on positive or negative, keywords, and other features. 
    For the specific dataset, we chose Recipe Reviews and User Feedback. 
    (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/911/recipe+ reviews+and+user+feedback+dataset)  
    This dataset provides us with a review number, recipe number, recipe code, recipe name, comment ID, user ID, username, 
    user reputation, created at, reply count, thumbs up count, thumbs down count, best review score, review number of stars, 
    and the actual review text. By using the review stars, the text content of the review, and the amount of thumbs up/thumbs 
    down on the review, we can present the user with sorted reviews by whether they were positive or negative as well as how 
    popular each review was. We chose the review domain because it seemed the most interesting to us, and itâ€™s sometimes 
    annoying to scroll through reviews on a website because reviews on the website can be skewed or have spam to look past.
