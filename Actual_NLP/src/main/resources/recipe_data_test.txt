Creamy White Chili#0#0#I tweaked it a little, removed onions because of onion haters in my house, used Italian seasoning instead of just oregano, and use a paprika/ cayenne mix and a little more than the recipe called for.. we like everything a bit more hot. The chili was amazing! It was easy to make and everyone absolutely loved it. It will now be a staple meal in our house.
Creamy White Chili#7#0#Bush used to have a white chili bean and it made this recipe super simple. I've written to them and asked them to please!, bring them back
Creamy White Chili#4#2#I made this alongside a traditional chili for a winter gathering and this chili stole the show. I was expecting leftovers for additional meals during the week, but nope, no leftovers. It's mild, but there's always ways to spice it up if that's your preference. If you're thinking about it, just do it! It's easy, fast, warming, and delicious. Oh, and might as well double it. I did.
Creamy White Chili#5#1#Fantastic, but mild. I added half a Carolina Reaper. Delish! The hubby said he detested white chili. As this was simmering, hubby said Boy, that sure smells great! When do we eat? He asked me to make more to freeze for later. LOL! 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#These are the best au gratin potatoes I've ever made. Very rich and cheesy, in fact my mom thought I used cream instead of milk. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#This recipe is very easy to make. I doubled the cheese, cut the onion in half plus I placed 3 strips of bacon in the bottom of the casserole dish and 4 strips of bacon across the top. My family loved this. I definately be making this again.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Tastes like my grandmas! Delicious!!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#This was simple and very tasty. I used green onions instead of white. I will make this again!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Yummy, yummy, yummy. Will make this again and again!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#This is an excellent basic au gratin potato recipe. Because we love cheese so much, I added an extra 1/4 cup or so of grated cheddar.
Bruschetta Chicken#1#0#Where do people add the balsamic? Just as a drizzle once cooked?
Bruschetta Chicken#4#0#OMG! This is good! The only thing I did different was add balsamic vinegar as suggested in other reviews.
Bruschetta Chicken#12#0#Delicious! I did add some balsamic vinegar to the bruschetta on the suggestions of several reviewers, making it more like authentic bruschetta. The only other thing I did differently was to use the bread crumbs to coat the chicken (after the egg dip) rather than to just place it on top of the chicken. I halved the recipe since there was only two of us, but I did make the whole recipe of the bruschetta. I tossed the extra onto some angel hair pasta and it made a nice side for the chicken. Will definitely make again.
Bruschetta Chicken#1#0#I made this recipe this afternoon. Wonderful!!!!! Easy peasy.
Bruschetta Chicken#1#1#I'd prepared this recipe when it first came out in Taste of Home. When I'd prepared it, my changes were: using 1 can (14.5-oz.) diced Italian tomatoes. The chicken was dipped in eggs, then in the flour. Baking time: covered for 20 minutes, uncovered and baked at least 20 to 30 minutes. 
Bruschetta Chicken#4#0#I have made this numerous times, it is absolutely delicious. It tastes like a high calories dish but it is not. I followed pdossantos suggestion, I dipped in flour, eggs then bread crumbs and poured butter over the chicken (the first time I made it I did follow directions exactly) I found this worked better for me. I also used basil paste, found in the produce department. It is on my every two week menu
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Very good!!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Huge hit with the family!!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#easy enough for my kids to help! smells great baking and tastes wonderful! yummy!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#The first two loaves I made were gone in less than two days. My kids were in love. Then I made two more and those were gone almost as fast. I have now made a total of 8 loaves and we stopped buying bread from the store. I cook it 30 mins, baste them with butter and then cook them 5 more minutes. Then I baste them again when I take them out. I didn't have canola oil so I just use vegetable and it's amazing! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I have made this recipe a few times now and it has become my go to recipe. I generally always end up using a mixture of whole wheat and regular all purpose flour and it turns out great. I use this recipe not only for bread,'but also for homemade calzones and stromboli. It really is a great all purpose bread dough. 
Zucchini Cupcake#4#0#I rarely bake anything that doesn't have chocolate in it, but this recipe looked so good I had to try it. I followed the recipe exactly, and the cupcakes and frosting were scrumptious! The only thing I would do differently would be to start checking them after 15-18 minutes, as they weren't quite as moist as I would have liked when I removed them from the oven after 20 minutes. But I am definitely adding this to my list of favorite recipes!
Zucchini Cupcake#2#2#I'm not sure that I'd reviewed this recipe before, so I'll do it now I used half and half cream instead of the milk for the frosting and followed recipe for the basic cupcakes. However, I baked 7 cupcakes and three 5 x3 loaves I iced the loaves right away and thinned frosting with about 2 to 3 Tbsp. more half and half cream. This is a real winner of a recipe as it had been in one of the contests! 
Zucchini Cupcake#6#0#Excellent recipe! I did sub nutmeg for cloves and baked in greased floured tiny cupcake pan...came out perfect at 12 minutes..350Â°....a keeper!!!
Zucchini Cupcake#4#0#Yummy! Even my vegetable-hating grandchildren loved these cupcakes! They were moist and tasty even without the caramel topping. With the caramel, they were out-of-this world! I'll have to plant more zucchini! 
Zucchini Cupcake#3#1#This was one of the first recipes I made when I began subscribing to the Taste of Home magazine in the 1990's. I made the cupcakes for a outdoor concert I was going to on a summer evening. Delicious, moist spice cupcakes with a wonderful butterscotch icing. They were a big hit with my friends. Couldn't eat just one. 
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#Absolutely scrumptious!! Definitely in the Let's do this again category. 
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#Made in a 13x9 glass pan 30 min at 350. Powdered sugar not on ingredients list and didn't have any, so just put carmel sauce on top. Very yummy. 
Zucchini Cupcake#4#0#I have been making these zucchini cupcakes since the recipe first came out in 1997, and it remains my favorite to this day. I make it exactly as written - it is perfect!
Zucchini Cupcake#2#0#I have an amazing zucchini muffin recipe that I have been using for decades. But I wanted to branch out. I was glad I did! I liked the almond extract and the caramel frosting is terrific. The texture is amazing too, a nice not too dense, but thick enough consistency. Cinnamon and cloves are just right and not overwhelming.
Zucchini Cupcake#2#0#Really enjoy these cupcakes. The caramel frosting is such a great combination with the almond and spice flavor of the cake.
Zucchini Cupcake#2#0#Great flavor. Made 23
