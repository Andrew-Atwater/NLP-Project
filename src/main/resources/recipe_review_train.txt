This was fabulous! Thank you for sharing#positive
Apple Pie#0#0#I never thought to put ginger in my apple pie. Pumpkin pie, sure, but NEVER apple. Then this recipe came along and showed me another way. It's SO yummy! It seems like an insignificant amount, but the ginger really adds some zing! 
Apple Pie#0#0#Loved this! It's beautiful to look at and so tasty too! 
Apple Pie#0#0#FANTASTIC! Made this for Thanksgiving dinner this year, after family agreed they wanted an apple pie. The filling set up perfect, so cut like a dream. I loved the spice and sugar levels, was just perfect. Will be adding to my go-to list of desserts. :)
Apple Pie#0#0#I had to use orange juice instead of lemon and I added 1/2 cup blueberries it was a great recipe
Apple Pie#0#0#Am I the only one who cannot see what temperature to bake this at?
Apple Pie#0#0#Excellent flavor! Everyone loved it.
Apple Pie#0#0#Easy to follow recipe. Very easy prep, & we baked a perfect home made apple pie. The entire house smelled wonderful! I highly recommend this recipe for the novice baker, along with accomplished bakers as well. We were very happy with the results. We used a mixture of granny smith apples and fuji apples. It was beautiful,and tasted just as great! Highly recommend for anyone who wants to impress their family with a gorgeous, homemade pie. PS. It was just as good cold the next day, or even reheated in the microwave. I felt proud of our efforts. Sincerely, Mrs. Vance
Apple Pie#0#0#So good. And I even forgot to dot with the buter before adding the top crust! Rave reviews from entire family.
Apple Pie#0#0#I made this pie, the taste was excellent but it was so runny. I went back through recipe to see if I missed anything but I hadn't. Any idea why. The apples were soft but still in shape. 
Apple Pie#0#0#I forgot to click on the stars to rate this recipe when I wrote my review. I give it 5 yummy stars.
Apple Pie#0#0#This is the first dessert our guests grab at our Labor Day barbecue. I bake 2 of these delicious apple pies and they are gone almost as soon as I put them on the table.
Apple Pie#0#0#I make this pie with soft white wheat flour and replace the sugar with succannot. EVERYONE LOVES it and we don't have to feel to guilty.:) I have made it for church and it is always gone. 
Apple Pie#0#0#This is a very easy apple pie and delicious. I use orange juice if I don't have lemon . It is a good pie to make an impression, if you are a first time pie maker. The pie crust from a box is tasty. I have made this apple pie recipe a few times . 
Apple Pie#0#0#My first apple pie & my lifelong recipe. Be sure to COOL COMPLETELY before slicing! I used this filling in empanadas & wontons, too!
Apple Pie#0#0#This will be my new go-to apple pie recipe - it's great! I used all Granny Smith apples and added two extra tablespoons of flour as recommended here by some and it came out perfect. I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of caramel sauce and it was a huge hit! 
Apple Pie#0#0#Excellent taste. Totally worth trying. Definitely a classic.
Apple Pie#0#0#I've used this recipe for the last two Thanksgivings and it comes out great! I read the reviews and decided to scoop the apples out of the large bowl, instead of pouring them. That kept the pie from being too soupy. This recipe is a keeper! 
Apple Pie#0#0#This is an amazing Apple Pie - it is yummy and reheats very well! A big hit at our New Year's Eve party. Will repeat recipe for the next family/friends event. Highly recommended! 
Apple Pie#0#0#I've made this pie twice now and it was delicious both times! One variation that my dad remembers from his childhood is to use an oatmeal crisp on top rather than a second pie crust. I used the crisp recipe from this site Winning Apple Crisp but made the rest of the pie as directed on this site, covering the entire pie for the first 20 minutes. Incredible! 
Apple Pie#0#0#Made this pie for Thanksgiving, was going to make a pumpkin pie, but then my son-in-law gave me some apples, so made this one instead, and everyone loved it.
Apple Pie#0#0#I made this pie for thanksgiving dinner. It was great. Will make it again.
Apple Pie#0#0#I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and found it to be the absolute best apple pie I have ever tasted. Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe.
Apple Pie#0#0#instead of all tart apples I used granny smith buabaum abd fujie apples and increast the cinnimon to 1 1/2 teaspoons turned out fantastic
Apple Pie#0#0#I lost my Mom's recipe and tried this one. It was easy to make and had great flavor. My fiance went back for a second serving so I know it was good! 
Apple Pie#0#0#My review didn't show the 5 stars I gave this recipe, so resubmitting. 
Apple Pie#0#0#I made this at the spur of the moment for company today. I had the pie prepared & in the oven in less than an hour. I used the silicone pie crust protector that I got from the Shop Taste of Home web site & it worked great! My pie turned out perfect & the only thing I will change next time is I will bake it just a tad longer or maybe at a slightly higher temp as I am at a high altitude.
Apple Pie#0#0#This turned out great family loved it and like another person I forgot the butter too. It was still great with out it. Would be really good with homemade whip cream.
Apple Pie#0#0#I get asked for this recipe all the time!
Apple Pie#0#1#I made the Apple Pie today. Came out ok. I read the other reviews several cooks said they added additional flour to thicken the mixture. I used granny smith apples so they don't produce a lot of juice so I didn't need the addition flour that is required in with more juicy apples. I did find the pie was a bit too sweet. My fault again I should have tasted my apples. 
Apple Pie#0#0#I maid this for my brother and sister in law but as I was putting it in I realizedthat I forgot the butter.They said that it was the best apple pie that they ever had.(I still think that it could of used butter:)
Apple Pie#0#0#I add some oatmeal to absorb some of the juice.
Apple Pie#0#0#So good and so easy. My husband loves it so It is definitely a keeper. I used green apples since that was what I had on hand and they were delicious.
Apple Pie#0#0#Truly delicious. I've found my favourite pie recipe. 
Apple Pie#0#0#I also use the additional 3 Tablespoons of flour. I also normally use two or three different kinds of apples. This is by far our favorite recipe!
Apple Pie#0#0#Very good!! First apple pie I made..definately will make again!
Apple Pie#0#1#This is the first apple pie I have made and it got rave reviews. I went by the recipe using 7 cups of apples. I used half Gala and half Braeburn and sliced them pretty thin. I found the pie to be a good consistency, not runny at all, even after cutting, the filling does not run out in the empty area.
Apple Pie#0#0#Made only one of these pies for Thanksgiving. I cut it into tiny slices so that none would be wasted by my grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Only those who were at my house first got any! My son who does not care for sweets ate about half of the pie. His son who does not like apple pie ate two slices of it and loved it. The rest of us got a sliver of it and wanted more!! I made it with Splenda in place of the sugar as my husband and I are diabetic. Needless to say, I am making at least three or four of these pies for Christmas. I am sure there will be none left over!!
Apple Pie#0#0#Made this recipe today to take to friends' for dinner. She's diabetic so swapped out the sugars for Splendas & added 5 T. of flour - got 2 thumbs up!!! It set up beautifully! Everyone loved it (better than my mom's & i didn't think that was possible!!). Definitely a keeper!! 
Apple Pie#0#0#This pie filling is the best I have ever had....and I didn't use a regular pie crust...I used the pie crust from the Dutch Apple Pie recipe...to die for!!!! 
Apple Pie#0#0#This is the first Applie Pie I have ever made, and I recieved many compliments from it.I did additional flour as the reviews had said.One family member actually said that it tasted just like Grandma's pies used to.... that is the best compliment anyone could give me! =)I will definatley make it again. 
Apple Pie#0#0#I never made an apple pie before so this was my first attempt. Everybody loved it! In fact, I've made this 4 times in just 2 weeks. 
Apple Pie#0#0#I made this recipe for the first time on Thanksgiving this year. I had read through the reviews and I added 3 tbs of flour to the dry mix. After tossing the apples there was still some mixture left in the bowl, which I proceeded to sprinkle evenly over the apples before placing top crust. It came out great. It was my first time making apple pie myself and this was as easy as can be. I will definitely make this one again. I did not find it too sweet at all, but I will try different apples with it as the Granny Smiths I used were really tart. The sweetness is a matter of taste. Thank you for sharing this recipe.
Apple Pie#0#0#Way to watery.
Apple Pie#0#0#This was a great recipe and really easy to make! I used granny smith apples. It was a little sweet but by reading other reviews, maybe I will add a little mor flour next time. Yum!
Apple Pie#0#0#All in all, it's a good pie. The 5 stars deceived me though. It's way, way, way too runny. I should have read the reviews in addition checking the star rating. So if you're getting ready to bake this pie, do NOT dump the coated apples onto the pie crust under any circumstances (unless you like apple pie soup). 
Apple Pie#0#0#I recently went to an apple festival in NC. I had never made a pie before, any pie, and wanted to give it a try. I used honey crisp apples from Grandads Farm and a pie crust recipe from this site. I carefully followed all directions. Absolutely wonderful!
Apple Pie#0#0#Loved it and so did everyone that tried it. Great thank you!
Apple Pie#0#0#Wonderful pie, its the only recipe Ill use.
Apple Pie#0#0#Made this tonight and the flavour is amazing. I did add extra flour to thicken as well (will probably add more next time perhaps an extra 2T) Also added a couple of sprinkles of watkins apple pie spice. Kids probably would have eaten it all if I had let them. I may reduce the sugar a tad next time but still enjoyed just the same.
Apple Pie#0#0#I just made this apple pie today and it came out wonderful! That's saying a lot because I am not a big fan of apple pie. I added a tiny bit of clove because I like that flavor. Great recipe! 
Apple Pie#0#0#We loved the pie, after reading the reviews I did added 3 heafing tablespoons of flour to thicken the pie. Came out great I served the Apple Pie for dinner with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the top.
Apple Pie#0#0#As a member of our local American Legion, I often donate baked goods to our monthly steak nights. What says America more than homemade apple pie! This recipe is super easy and delicious! Will definitely make again and again!
Apple Pie#0#0#This pie is great! Everyone loves it, everytime. It isn't too sweet for me. To avoid it being runny, scoop the apples out of the bowl instead of dumping them into the crust. That way, any leftover mixture that didn't coat onto the apples will remain in the bowl. A+ Recipe! 
Apple Pie#0#0#I've never made a pie before, and I used this Apple Pie Recipe as my first attempt and it turned out Great! YUM! :) 
Apple Pie#0#0#Over and over and over. This is by far the best apple pie recipe I have found.
Apple Pie#0#0#Very good recipe. Didn't last long at my house. 
Apple Pie#0#0#This is a great recipe! I added 8 cups of apples and 2 tbls of butter. Next time I would add 1/4 tsp of ground cloves to add a little zest to it. It came out soupy but I let it sit overnight and it was fine. I will be making this again for sure!
Apple Pie#0#0#my favorite apple pie recipe. Sometimes I add a little pumpkin pie spice as well just to spice it up a notch
Apple Pie#0#0#its awesome but my came out runny even though i followed directions exactly and let it cool for 2 hrs.
Apple Pie#0#0#Family Favorite!
Apple Pie#0#0#very good recipe!! very easy to make and tasted wonderful! i also added some caramel syrup to it :) yummmmm
Apple Pie#0#0#Love this recipe. I used ready made pie crust by Pillsbury. Other than that i stuck to the recipe. It was a big hit with my family. So easy!!
Apple Pie#0#0#It is a tad bit sweet.. so when I make it next time I will cut down the sugar some. Otherwise it was fantastic!!
Apple Pie#0#0#I decided to make it today after reading the reviews, but it was extremely sweet. I won't make it again. 
Apple Pie#0#0#This is sooo good!
Apple Pie#0#0#Yum Yum! This pie was very easy to make and very delicious.
Apple Pie#0#0#Perfect Apple Pie Recipe! This will stay in my recipe file forever.
Apple Pie#0#0#Tasted just like apple pie should. YUMMY.
Apple Pie#0#0#Apple Pie,Wow!! So yummy. I added 1/2 tsp. of Apple Pie spice to the rest of the ingredients it was great. Thumbs up on this recipe.
Apple Pie#0#0#this pie is very good classic apple pie
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#6#0#I cut up the tortillas to layer in pan instead of leaving whole so it is easier to cut or spoon out of dish and I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream to cut calories
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#8#0#Excellent recipe. I used Corn tortillas.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#3#1#Will this feed a family of 6 that eats like an army?
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#7#4#Everyone liked it, even my picky eater gave it a 4/10 which is pretty good. LOL. The kind of recipe you can adapt to your tastes and add/subtract things. I followed the recipe except I used corn tortillas and fried them as others suggested and I found the bottom too hard to cut so follow the instructions and put them in uncooked. I also added green onion as a garnish.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#14#3#Made as written except added hot sauce to beef used whole package of taco seasoning and split between meat and sour cream. Used extra cheese and put lettuce and tomato on side so everyone could add their own. Only reason is for reheating left overs. Was yummy, quick and easy.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#8#1#Big hit in our house! I use corn tortillas and leave out the Italian dressing because it's not something I keep on hand. Have already made this three times and it's on the menu again for this weekend, the whole family loves it. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#68#19#I'm always surprised when someone changes a recipe and then rates their own recipe! If you want to give the original recipe a rating, you'll need to actually make it as it was written. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#8#15#Made this with only 4 low-carb tortillas, ricotta cheese instead of sour cream (had more of that). Added shredded cheese to each individual serving. Used a turkey breakfast sausage for meat- had on hand. Cut calories!!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#13#4#I thought this was delicious, and my whole family agreed!! I did read the comments before making it, and saw that one suggested using more taco seasoning which I did, and was thrilled with the outcome. I left out the Italian dressing and cilantro, and we were out of tomatoes and lettuce so I did tweak it quite a bit but it ended up amazing. We will definitely be making this again!!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#4#13#We're not great fans of beans, so I put a small can of corn and a grated zucchini in the ground beef mixture instead. I didn't use the Italian dressing, and I used my own version of taco seasoning (with garlic powder, sweet smoked paprika, and ground cayenne pepper). I served lettuce, tomato and chopped onions, salsa, and plain yogurt on the side (makes it easier to reheat leftovers). We all really enjoyed it. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#18#6#I love Mexican food. This looked so good but tasted sooooo disappointing! I wondered about not adding an entire package of taco seasoning, should have went ahead and added the whole thing. The flour tortillas were a mistake too....just mush and blah. It really didn't taste like an enchilada casserole at all. It had potential but just a huge fail taste wise.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Fabulous and tasty. Easy to make. My kids wanted seconds. Followed the recipe.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Very easy and my husband and son loved it??
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#11#0#This was a hit at my house. I used corn tortillas that I fried. Didn't add the Italian dressing but did add 5 garlic cloves and 1 jalapeno to the hamburger while cooking. Just the right amount of heat for us. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Very quick to make and quite tasty! Thanks for a great recipe:)
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#This was simple and easy to fix, my whole family loved it. I will be making this a lot. Thanks for a great recipe.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#0#So easy and delicious. We like a bit of heat so I added red pepper flakes to the beef and onions and mixed in some pickled jalapenos slices to the finished mixture before baking to spice it up a bit. Will definitely make it again!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Super quick and easy family meal! Entire family loves this recipe and it's even great for leftovers! We prefer the flour tortillas it many have recommended corn if you're a fan! I did not add the sour cream as my son and his dad hate it, it still turned out fantastic! Definitely printing out a copy for my recipient books!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#0#Great recipe! Everyone loves it and it's easy to make. I've tried the recipe using flour tortillas and with corn tortillas. Both ways are good, but my family prefers it with the corn tortillas. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#What a great recipe! Came together quick and my whole family LOVED it!! Would be a very easy recipe to accommodate to your family's personal tastes! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#So good! Even my picky eaters loved it!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#0#Oh my goodness this was good. I didn't have any ground meat but I had leftover brisket and it was perfect!! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#3#1#Basically followed original recipe...however we preferred a bit more lettuce, tomato, etc. This is fun because you CAN make little adjustments to your family's liking and it is still AMAZING! Sorry, but even a little mushy I don't see how it would ruin the taste or make it gross. If it boiled over in your oven, and you used a 11 x7 Pyrex, it is because the recipe calls for an 11 x17 pan. Usually things boil over if your pan is too small OR your oven cooks too hot. My family thought it was great...I thought it was nutritious (hidden!), and we had fun all making it together. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#2#My husband and I didn't like it because of the flour tortillas. Should use corn tortillas. He thought bottom tortillas were hard from the baking. I had leftovers next day and the tortillas were mushy, pretty gross. Also, it bubbled over onto the bottom of my oven the last 5-10 minutes, uncovered, in an 11x7 Pyrex.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Oh so very good. The leftovers were even better. I highly recommend.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#0#Great recipe! My family loves things cheesy so I added more cheese and sour cream.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#1#I change out black beans for pinto beans and omitted the Clintro as we don't care for it. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#0#I added a diced bull pepper and a half can of rinsed corn and didn't use cumin or the dressing because of the other reviews where people said it didn't add to the flavor of the meal, it was awesome! I also used probably three cups of cheese and it was almost quesadilla like, very delicious and different for basically tacos or burritos, my five kids ate every bite!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Loved this recipe. Made it for my husband's poker buddies. They gobbled it up! I did use more sour cream than called for but that only made the dish more creamy. Used a little more Mexican blend cheese than called for. I did add the Italian dressing and didn't see that it altered the dish adversely. I will definitely make this dish again. Served shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, guacamole and extra salsa on the side. Also served a corn salad which was made ahead. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#I loved this recipe! The flavors are great. I made this exactly as stated and wouldn't change a thing! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#1#I have made this several times and it never disappoints. I generally buy the burrito size tortillas since one will fit nicely in the bottom of my round casserole dish. I then place half the burger mixture on it and layer it with one more tortilla and finish as directed. So easy and quick to make.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#1#I've made this twice. I think I used corn tortillas the first time and liked it better than with flour. I used about 1 1/2 cups of cheese instead of just 1 cup, and my family thought it needed more cheese. Next time I will use less cumin and will leave out the Italian dressing. Someone mentioned 3 layers of tortillas. I'm pretty sure it's just 2 layers. I placed 1 tortilla in the middle and tore the others to make them fit. I ended up only using 5 tortillas. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#2#This was a perfect recipe for my son to make who is learning to cook. He did it all himself following the well written directions. It really was a tasty dish, and the presentation was lovely. Son was quite proud of himself---even took a picture to email a friend! I told him he will have to fix it again for Cinco de Mayo! Thanks for sharing.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#0#I used corn tortillas instead of flour. Omitted the Italian dressing. I also added a can of refried beans and stirred the sour cream in meat/bean mixture.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#1#I made this for a neighborhood get-together, and it was a big hit. I will definitely make it again! I had 8 tortillas, so I made a third layer. I also had ground Elk, and used it instead of beef. It has very little fat. I used 2 cups of cheese. Thanks for sharing.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Wow! Quick and easy, and so good! I thought the Italian dressing was an odd addition, but I think it adds to the flavor. I did, however, leave out the black beans (picky kids.)
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Left out the Italian dressing. Used corn tortillas. Did not use enough. I only made one layer of torn tortillas. Next time I would use more. Since I suspected there weren't enough I sprayed tortillas and baked them the last 5 minutes of the casserole so we had chips. I added refried beans along with the black beans and stirred in Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I also used ground turkey instead of beef. We loved it. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Since it's the first time I made this, I followed directions exactly as written, made no modifications. It was good, but the Italian dressing clashed with the rest of the flavors and I didn't care for that bit. Will make again and omit dressing. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Great casserole! Everybody loves it. We typically make this dish for families with new babies or people who have had surgeries, etc. And we always get asked for the recipe. It's delicious! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Super easy to make, great taste. Family loved it!!!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Excellent dish! I've made it with (ground) beef, turkey, deer, and today I used elk. I also make Homemade Tortillas (another Taste of Home recipe) just to make it as healthy as possible. Thanks for sharing!!!! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#We LOVE this! I did lightly blend the salsa and onion because the kids don't like the texture, I mixed the sour cream together with the meat/bean mixture and used more cheese, about 2 cups. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Delish! Added retried beans, no Italian seasoning. Even my kids loved it. Will make again
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I completely forgot to put the Italian dressing in, however, it was great. Easy to make and we will definitely have it again.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Enjoyed this very much. I left out the Italian dressing (I just forgot it, I think), and used small corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas. I thought it came out a bit dry, so I might add more salsa or some enchilada sauce next time. The whole family scarfed it down!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Halved all ingredients and omitted Italian dressing. My husband and I loved it, one serving left that we will have to fight over.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Favorite
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#We liked this, and I did leave out the Italian dressing becsuse I could not think of a reason for putting those flavors in a Tex Mex dish. Also used refreid beans and pepper jack cheese instead of the mexican blend.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Faimly and Friends loved it.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#I omit the Italian salad dressing. Extra salsa used. Used a can of refried beans as well as the black beans. Good chance to get the extra vegetables/fiber my family needs.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#WeweeWe
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#my kids love this recipe . It's a huge hit at our dinner table. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#We really liked this dish. I used corn tortillas instead of the flour. For the beef mixture, I used refried beans instead of the black beans, and also added green chiles and corn. I didn't have Mexican cheese, so I used sharp cheddar. This is a very versatile recipe, so using the suggestions of others worked well. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing this recipe! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Bottom layer hard to cut thru. Overall good flavor.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This had good flavor, but using flour tortillas made the layers too thick and hard to cut and eat. If I make it again, I will use corn tortillas.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This recipe tasted great! It was also really easy to make. I did use 2 cups of the cheese instead of 1 because it just didn't seem like enough, even though that added a lot more calories. Next time I might try saving the sour cream out and putting it on top. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Love this casserole. I add a layer of refried beans and jalapenos. Very good!!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was delicious and so quick and easy to make with simple ingredients. This is a keeper!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Use corn tortillas for a real enchilada texture. Flour tortillas get soggy.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My family loved it!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Excellent!!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I liked it but my husband and son did not. I think the three layers of tortillas made it hard to cut through and the leftovers were soggy.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Quick and delicious
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This is an excellent recipe. I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef and I used hot taco seasoning mix. My family loved it!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#i used a can of Mexican stewed tomatoes instead of salsa and added a can of corn and some diced jalapenos. It was delicious! New favorite!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#easy, like the ingredients, OK taste
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#New family favorite!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Excellent! I omitted the sour cream & Italian dressing because my husband isn't a fan of those foods. It still came out moist & tasty. This will certainly be a repeat dish. Jalapeno's would be a good addition for extra kick too. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My family and I really enjoyed this meal. It was easy to prepare and I will definitely serve it again.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#i take this to potlucks and everyone loves it . I use black bean and corn salsa. Just wonder how long to cook it in a crock pot?
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I didn't make any adjustments. I love it and friends and family love it just as it is. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Wonderful Delight!!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#A hit with the family! Hubby, I and 12 year old and 4 year old. Needs to be doubled as the four of us ate the entire dinner in one sitting with only one helping of leftovers left, which the children fought over for lunch the next day. Super simple to make, too!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Turned out really well. It is a wonderful dish.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#We really liked this recipe. Easy and delicious!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Delicious! I left out the dressing because I didn't have any. I took this to a ladies' dinner at church and didn't bring home a single bite! Everyone raved about it! I added a little salsa to the bottom and mixed the sour cream in the meat mixture as others recommended. Easy and delicious! I can't wait to make it again! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#EXCELLENT AND EASY TO MAKE! I thought the 400 degree oven temp excessive so I baked at 350 degrees for the specified time. Also spread a little salsa on bottom of casserole dish. No burning or crisp tortillas. This dish is definitely a keeper . Next time I will kick it up a little by adding some green chiles and/or chipotle chiles in adobe to mix. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Instead of the black beans, I used refriedBeans and layered each tortilla.Almost like a Mexican lasagna.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#!I have to tell you that the first time I made this was in Mexico. My Mexican friends loved it!!!Deveras. If you are finding the bottom too crisp then spread a little salsa in the bottom of your pan first. I always make it in a round casserole pan that accommodates the size of the tortillas I use. IF there is anything leftover, the taste is even better the next day for lunch. I serve with hot salsa on the side to accommodate all tastes
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#We liked it.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This is an awesome recipe. Quick and easy. Cilantro sets it off! Thanks!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Definitely went back for seconds!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Good recipe and easy to make. Next time, I will try throwing some jalapeños on top as well since we love spicy food.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#great recipe, wonderful flavor, going to try with ground turkey next time for fewer calories
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Good recipe, will make it again. Love the cilantro, and I also mashed half of the beans and added a little more sour cream.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Very good and tasty. Will be making this again soon!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Wonderful recipe....this is a keeper...will make this again and again.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I haven't made it for awhile but think I put a little salsa on the bottom of the pan to keep the tortillas moist.  I mashed up the black beans the 2nd time I made it so our youngest GS wouldn't find the beans.  He loves the casserole when the beans are mashed....wouldn't eat it the 1st time because he found a whole black bean & announced he'doesn't eat beans'. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I'm giving 4 stars only because my bottom tortilla got too crispy to cut which made it messy. I also substituted pintos for the black beans. Great flavor but may try cutting tortillas into strips as Ceannze mentioned. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Recipe was wonderful. Family loved and they are tough critics!!!!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Wonderful recipe, easy to make and something different!.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was the entree for tonight's dinner and it was well received! I left out the Italian dressing as I'm not a fan of it anyway, but it was excellent! I put the recipe in my favorite recipe box too. What do you think of tearing the tortillas in pieces instead of placing 3 down and 3 layered with the meat mixture? 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I just made this dish tonight and WOW....this is a keeper! Like others I also added the sour cream in the meat mixture.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Made this tonight and it was delicious. Very simple to make. Will be making again in the near future.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Great easy to make very good - love this recipe!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My family loves this recipe. I use ground turkey and add the sour cream to the mixture. I also add a can a corn. 5 stars!!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Super quick and easy and my family LOVES this recipe! I use ground turkey in stead of beef. The only other change I made was stirring the sour cream into the sauce mix after removing from heat. This recipe is a real keeper!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My family loves this recipe!!! I make this all the time. A real keeper!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I had ground beef I had to use last night and decided to make this for dinner. I usually don't have high hopes for casserole type dishes, but this turned out to be OUTSTANDING. My husband said it's one of the best things I've ever made. It's on the dinner rotation now. Thank you so much! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Loved it! Subbed pepper jack cheese for mexican blend. Super simple to throw together. A bit messy but who cares...it tastes great!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Very Good! I think I would double the tortillas though but over all it was great!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Love it and very easy to make.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Huge hit with the family!!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#easy enough for my kids to help! smells great baking and tastes wonderful! yummy!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#The first two loaves I made were gone in less than two days. My kids were in love. Then I made two more and those were gone almost as fast. I have now made a total of 8 loaves and we stopped buying bread from the store. I cook it 30 mins, baste them with butter and then cook them 5 more minutes. Then I baste them again when I take them out. I didn't have canola oil so I just use vegetable and it's amazing! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I have made this recipe a few times now and it has become my go to recipe. I generally always end up using a mixture of whole wheat and regular all purpose flour and it turns out great. I use this recipe not only for bread,'but also for homemade calzones and stromboli. It really is a great all purpose bread dough. 
Zucchini Cupcake#4#0#I rarely bake anything that doesn't have chocolate in it, but this recipe looked so good I had to try it. I followed the recipe exactly, and the cupcakes and frosting were scrumptious! The only thing I would do differently would be to start checking them after 15-18 minutes, as they weren't quite as moist as I would have liked when I removed them from the oven after 20 minutes. But I am definitely adding this to my list of favorite recipes!
Zucchini Cupcake#2#2#I'm not sure that I'd reviewed this recipe before, so I'll do it now I used half and half cream instead of the milk for the frosting and followed recipe for the basic cupcakes. However, I baked 7 cupcakes and three 5 x3 loaves I iced the loaves right away and thinned frosting with about 2 to 3 Tbsp. more half and half cream. This is a real winner of a recipe as it had been in one of the contests! 
Zucchini Cupcake#6#0#Excellent recipe! I did sub nutmeg for cloves and baked in greased floured tiny cupcake pan...came out perfect at 12 minutes..350°....a keeper!!!
Zucchini Cupcake#4#0#Yummy! Even my vegetable-hating grandchildren loved these cupcakes! They were moist and tasty even without the caramel topping. With the caramel, they were out-of-this world! I'll have to plant more zucchini! 
Zucchini Cupcake#3#1#This was one of the first recipes I made when I began subscribing to the Taste of Home magazine in the 1990's. I made the cupcakes for a outdoor concert I was going to on a summer evening. Delicious, moist spice cupcakes with a wonderful butterscotch icing. They were a big hit with my friends. Couldn't eat just one. 
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#Absolutely scrumptious!! Definitely in the Let's do this again category. 
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#Made in a 13x9 glass pan 30 min at 350. Powdered sugar not on ingredients list and didn't have any, so just put carmel sauce on top. Very yummy. 
Zucchini Cupcake#4#0#I have been making these zucchini cupcakes since the recipe first came out in 1997, and it remains my favorite to this day. I make it exactly as written - it is perfect!
Zucchini Cupcake#2#0#I have an amazing zucchini muffin recipe that I have been using for decades. But I wanted to branch out. I was glad I did! I liked the almond extract and the caramel frosting is terrific. The texture is amazing too, a nice not too dense, but thick enough consistency. Cinnamon and cloves are just right and not overwhelming.
Zucchini Cupcake#2#0#Really enjoy these cupcakes. The caramel frosting is such a great combination with the almond and spice flavor of the cake.
Zucchini Cupcake#2#0#Great flavor. Made 23
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Sooooo yummy! I get a lot of compliments on this one. My husband said it's the creamiest peanut butter fudge he's ever had. 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#easy to make and tastes wonderful...I did not have marshmellow creme and used marshmellows instead, turned out great!!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#This is my never fail fudge. Because it is timed it is always yummy and perfect!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#This is the best peanut butter fudge I've ever had! I have been making it for several years now since my 14 year-old was in the 3rd grade. His teacher at the time still talks about how great it is and she now makes it for all her co-workers at Christmas. I am getting ready to make it right now! For those who have had problems with it setting up, the only time that ever happened to me was the first time I made it-I didn't cook it for the full 3 minutes. Make sure you time it or it will not set up. Don't give up, though, just try it again and it will be perfect!! 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Unfortunately, my fudge never set-up. I left it in the fridge for several hours. I even tried the freezer for a little while but it didn't help. It tastes good but I can't give it to anyone else. 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I HAVE MADE THIS FUDGE ABOUT 4 TIMES NOW IN THE LAST MONTH,EVERYBODY WANTS THIS RECIPE,THIS WILL DEFINATELY BE THE DESSERT THAT I MAKE FOR THE FAMILY HOLIDAY DINNERS...THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE BEST PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE IN THE WORLD. AND SO EASY TO MAKE. I'M GOING TO MAKE SOME RIGHT NOW. : ) 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I make this fudge a lot and sometimes I will add a small mashed banana
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I have been making this fudge for several years. Always comes out great. I use a slightly larger pan because I prefer smaller pieces. I make this with skim milk, as that is what we drink.No change in texture to me.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Has anyone tried this with fat free milk and reduced fat peanut butter?
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#This was so easy and so smooth, the best yet!!!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#This made a perfect Christmas gift for my family. I did add the vanilla and used part evaporated milk part 2% milk. Thanks for sharing.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Not sure what I did wrong, the fudge didn't set up. It taste great. anyone with ideas on how to salvage this? 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Yummy! And so easy to make!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I followed the recipe except i boiled for 4 min and added vanilla. It turned out perfect. I will definately make it again. It is a winner here in my home.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Nice texture, not too sweet ~ perfection! I used evaporated milk.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I absolutely love this recipe. I make it all the time and use it as gifts. Everyone who eats it loves it. I will never make another peanut butter fudge again.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Why can I not print the recipe & the nutrition facts together on your recipes? When I highlight to copy it I can print only the right side or the left side with select print. Help. S W
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#This is another one that's going in my recipe box. Yum! 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#7#2#This dish was delicious and one I will make again and again! I used cherry tomatoes as that's what's in our garden.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#9#5#After chopping and laying out the ingredients, my first step was to whisk the mayonnaise, vinegar, salt, and pepper. My second step was to add the tomato, celery, and green onions to the dressing and blend it well to integrate the flavors into the dressing. Then I continued on with the rest of the recipe. It was delicious.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#0#This is a great recipe. I made if for my husband and he loved it.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#9#2#Great recipe. I used cherry tomatoes as that's what the garden is overflowing with! I can only hope cooks reach a point of reading a recipe and assessing if the types of seasonings or quantity of seasonings suits their tastes. And then decide how or if you wish to make said recipe. We enjoyed this with additional fresh ground black pepper. Thank you
Bacon Macaroni Salad#2#1#My go to macaroni salad!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#2#33#There is something wrong in this recipe. No way would this be 12 servings of 3/4 cup each. It's maybe 6 cups total, and that's after I added additional tomato, celery and a little extra pasta. I don't know about you, but my idea of a main dish salad like this, with a pound of bacon in it, would be more than 3/4 cup - so please investigate and fix this. Otherwise this had good flavor. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#0#Just tried this salad and it is a keeper!! Husband commented at least 3 times how good it was. I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and it was perfect with some leftover for next day. Husband again told me 3 times how good it is.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#0#I've been making this since it first appeared in a magazine over 10 years ago. We love this simple salad. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#2#0#The family and I thought this salad was delicious! Am already planning on making it again!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#4#0#I can't understand the downers on this recipe. I took it to a large get together an even with doubling of the recipe there was none left and people were asking for more. This recipe is a keeper. I made sure I used Real Mayo. Great salad!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#1#0#This was super easy and really delicious. I didn't have fresh mushrooms so I used two small cans. I wasn't sure about that because we love fresh mushrooms, but when they were sauteed in butter and added to the recipe, they were great. My husband asked me to add more cheese and more green onion the next time. When we heated it for leftovers I would add a handful of shredded cheese on the chicken. I'll also try chicken tenderloins, as I almost always have them on hand. Just have to watch the cooking time. Fabulous! Good enough for a company dinner. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Easy recipe to follow and memorize. Thank you for the awesome recipe. This is now one of my favorites!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Followed recipe exactly & is delicious.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I looked at the recipe and thought it would be good. It looked so easy. It was VERY easy and VERY good. I would serve this at a wedding or wedding like event. It was great as leftovers as well. I added onion, parsley, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the chicken in the frying pan. I didn't fry it as long and let it bake in the oven longer. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was VERY tasty! Loved how easy it was, too! I doubled the ingredients for the sauce; served chicken and sauce over rice. I will definitely make this recipe again and again!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#So yummy! My husband loved it and he is not even a fan of mushrooms! Will definitely make again!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Excellent! Can't wait to make again. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I've made this a few times now, and it's fabulous. Everyone that's eaten it has wanted the recipe. It's a keeper. I've noted that the size the breasts are flattened to is not as important as simply keeping them uniform so that they cook evenly. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Wonderful dish, a local restaurant has a similar dish, but this is much better. I tend to always pound the chicken breasts as they cook evenly and are so tender.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Great dish, very easy and full of flavor. Used thin breast and did not flatten them.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Wow! This is really good! It smells amazing while it is baking and my kids just loved it. Even better as leftovers - I put it in my daughter's thermos and sent it to lunch with her the next day - 100% GONE! This is certainly a keeper. No changes to recipe necessary. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I didn't pound the chicken but let the breasts cook until their temperature was about 160 degrees. Very good recipe. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I must admit that I was very skeptical about the ingredients. It sounded a little bland but I was wrong. This was very tasty. I would only make enough to eat right away because the leftovers didn't taste as good. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Love this recipe! Serve it with with rice and you've got a great weekend meal and leftovers to look forward to the next night. Definitely in my rotation now! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#VERY good
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#My family loved it and it was so juicy and flavorful.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Wonderful
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Just made this tonight, and my husband and I both thought it was so good! I added some garlic powder and ground pepper to the chicken while sauteing for some extra flavor, and left off the green onions. Very tender and flavorful - great for a week night meal but would also be nice for guests. Definitely a keeper!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Delicious and very easy to make. I served it with instant brown rice (takes only 10 minutes to make) and fresh mini bell peppers. I liked it so much that I had it for dinner last night, and then for lunch and dinner today!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This is unbelievable. I used sliced baby portabella mushrooms I added some leftover white wine it was really elegant.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Great go to recipe, quick and east and very easy with a good blending of mushroom sauce and cheeses. I simply use thin chicken breasts and that makes it even quicker.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I would like to serve this with fresh pasta. Would I need sauce for the pasta or just olive oil and pepper. Any suggestions?
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#5 star recipe. Want to make it 6 stars? Sprinkle with crisp fried crumbled bacon before serving.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was so easy, and so tender. This is part of our normal rotation now. By the way, this is also great without the cheese for your picky eaters, just add it after.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was delicious! Made it with chicken tenders but otherwise didn't change a thing. Really easy dish that is sure to be a crowd pleaser. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I LOVE this recipe. It's great for a quick weeknight meal, but even better for company. It tastes and looks like it's a lot of work, but so simple. It's a go-to dish when I have guests over.TIP: This is also very easy to serve to someone who can't have dairy. It's still delicious if you keep the cheeses separate and sprinkle it on after dishing it up. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I tried this recipe tonight and it was delicious...thank you...I wish I knew how to add a picture....
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Easy, quick, and tasty chicken dish... very tende rand love the cheeses in this recipe. I plan to make this again soon.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Excellent dish! Wonderful flavor! I couldn't believe that I made it. Just the right amount of everything! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Outstanding! One of the best chicken dishes I've ever found too. Slight modifications I made include the use of chicken tenders, and onion powder and garlic powder added to the mushrooms (I didn't have any green onions). To echo previous comment, this is a new favorite! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This is excellent , I did add garlic as we love it and it was great, a new favorite!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I was looking for a recipe to use ingredients that I had left over, so I used onion powder instead of green onions and a sprinkling of extra-sharp cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. My family was totally over the moon for this dish. Superb!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Ths is one of the best chicken recipes I've ever found. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#WOW is all I can say! This is so yummy! I think the only thing I would do differently is eliminate the salt and add a little garlic. It was perfect with an entire 8oz container of mushrooms with some rice pilaf on the side. Anything more would have been too much food. Definitely making this again soon.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Very good! I think next time I wont add the extra salt. I think with the chicken broth, it added enough salt. It was very tasty and moist, will definitely make again!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#These are very similar to Paula Deen's Chicken Georgia recipe. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This has been a family favorite in our house for years! I admit, I always use more cheese than it calls for, probably 1 c. and I use the whole 8 oz package of mushrooms.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#So good! If you love mushrooms, you have to try this recipe!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was easy and tasty. I would add garlic to the mushroom saute next time and double the recipe - I bet it'd be great as leftovers. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This recipe was excellent! It was easy to make, too. My husband even gave it 5 stars and he doesn't give many recipes that high a rating. It would make a great dish for company. Served it with brown rice, Lemon Butter Green Beans and Strawberry Spinach Salad. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#T his was so yummy and easy! We will definetely make again.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#great tasting, easy to make,
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This may be the best chicken recipe that I have ever made. It is outstanding and can't wait to have the leftovers. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#My kids said the word amazing countless times tonight. It was a big hit! In addition to being family friendly, it's party worthy. A definite keeper! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This chicken turned out very flavorful and moist. I left out the mushrooms and added onions and Italian herbs, as I did not have any mushrooms. It is a great gourmet-style recipe that is not too complicated! I would definitely make this again!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I don't use the cheese. We love this dish. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#me and my husband really liked it. I didn't have any green onions but it turned out really well. I used about a cup of broth to start out with and it boiled down good. I loved the cheese on top and probably put more than called for! The mushrooms were fantastic! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#One of my favorite company dishes... especially when it isn't grilling season. So moist and flavorful - I always receive rave reviews. delicious with the Herbed Angel Hair Pasta. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I have made this recipe numerous times since the first time I served it to my family. It is excellent. We add additional mushrooms since we love them.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This is just the best chicken recipe. We love it.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This is the most amazing tender chicken ever, my whole family loves this and when my son comes home from college he always asks me to make this. Along with the mushrooms I will often add green peppers and onions. Turns out everytime!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was so easy to make and so delicious!! I added the whole package of mushrooms instead of just one cup, and I did 1/4 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup white wine... I HIGHLY recommend this!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#great recipe!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was delicious, I was feeling creative so I made some modifications. I added a few splashes of white wine for flavour, sautéed some garlic and onion in with the mushrooms . I also added some season salt to the flour mix. Served with asparagus and dill cream sauce...YUMMY!My boyfriend gave it a 9/10 and said that I need to remember this one 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Really enjoyed this recipe. It was delicious and simple. The only thing I did differently was saute the green onions with the mushrooms. I served it with garlic egg noodles and broccoli. Even my 8 yr. old and 5 yr. old liked it. They cleaned their plates!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Always looking for good, relatively easy to prepare, and able bake ahead if needed chicken recipes; this one is a keeper! We doubled the cheese, scallions, and sauce quantities.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Tender and flavorful describes this dish. The family goes wild over it. It's simple and great tasting. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I made this and it was very good, but I'mm confused that you start out with 1/2 cup broth and it says to reduce it to 1/2 cup. It ended up reducing to almost nothing (because I didn't realize it would go so fast) so I added another 1/2 cup broth to pour over the chicken. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#WOW! Everyone loved it! I didn't have mozzarella cheese or green onions and it was still wonderful! Next time I'll try to have both. We ate 2 hours ago and I can still taste it. Definately will make this one again!! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This chicken was absolutely delicious. I'm on the look-out for low carbohydrate recipes as my boyfriend is watching his carbs, and this filled the bill nicely. I could make it even more low-carb by just browning the breasts without the flour. The list of ingredients was simple, and I wasn't expecting it to taste as wonderful as it did. Great recipe! Everyone loved it. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#AWESOME flavor! I did not pound out the chicken breasts; I cut them thinner as in tenders and I added extra green onions. YUM! Looks as awesome as it tastes!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#A meal rarely gets rated as excellent by everyone; very good yes, but not very often an excellent. This one recipe received an excellent rating from all 4 family members.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#My kids loved it. Especially my oldest daughter.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I can't get over how delicious this dish was!!!!! It is by far, one of my favorites!! Thanks for sharing! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was SOOO good! Everything was so moist and delicious! I made it for the first time 2 nights ago...and my fiance requested that I make it again the very next night! This is deff. one of the best recipe's I have ever cooked! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I loved it and my guest did also! I cut it in half for two people. I pounded then instead of putting flour on it I sprinkled it with McCormicks Perfect Pinch Garlic & Herb salt free. Then put it in an 8 x 8 pan with the mushrooms and onions on it and baked it, covered. Then uncovered it and put the cheese on it.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was phenomenal and so easy! I used chicken cutlets instead of pounding out chicken breasts (had about 7 cutlets), and I added some diced green bell pepper and minced garlic to the broth and mushrooms. It was totally amazing! I agree, no need for the extra salt, the parmesan gives plenty of flavor. Will be adding this to my faves!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Great. My husband loved it and we will be making it again.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#i loved it!!!!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This is the best chicken ever. Sometimes I add green peppers too.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Delicious, but definitely does NOT need any added salt!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#As far as I'm concerned, this is the perfect recipe for a working mom. Very quick and easy and it's delicious. Very easy to make on those busy weekdays but also good for a nice relaxing dinner! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This is delicious and very easy to make. The ingredients are healthy and my wife loved it!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Everyone I serve this too loves it! It is wonderful and easy!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#My favorite! I made it for my dad, he said, That is the best chicken I've ever had. Score! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was very good and simple to make. I will make it again for my family. Whole family liked it.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Hubby and I LOVED this recipe! The flavors were really outstanding! To make it a little healthier, I substituted wheat flour for the all-purpose and used part-skim mozzarella.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Such a delicious recipe! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Chicken is tender and very good. One of my favorites. My Mom makes this often and I asked her for the recipe. Now I can make it also. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I bet a few tsp of almond extract would be really nice too.
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#Can you use whole milk?
Hot Milk Cake#13#0#My grandmother made this and when it came out of the oven she would spread some butter on it then sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on it.
Hot Milk Cake#6#5#Tried this recipe today and loved it does anyone know if it also works for cupcakes? If so, approximately how many does it make?
Hot Milk Cake#10#0#My husband loves this recipe! The only thing I find is I have to bake much longer than the 35 minutes, sometimes an extra 20 minutes.
Hot Milk Cake#7#0#My mom gave this recipe to me years ago, and it was perfect for strawberry shortcake. It transported well and held up well with the addition of the strawberry sauce. Easy to make, and everyone enjoyed it.
Hot Milk Cake#22#3#Wonderfully flavored cake. I followed the advice of one reviewer by adding the vanilla after I added the hot milk and butter. I baked it for 35 minutes and dusted the top with powdered sugar.
Hot Milk Cake#11#4#I followed the recipe as it, but the cake came out dense. I was expecting a lighter, fluffier cake. The flavor of the cake was good, but the texture was not what I was expecting. I was expecting a lighter, more spongier cake.
Hot Milk Cake#41#2#This is very similar to the recipe I grew up with. We waited until the butter and hot milk were added to the batter before putting in the vanilla---vanilla loses some of its' flavor under direct heat like hot milk, so you'll get a better vanilla flavor if you add it at the end. 
Hot Milk Cake#16#6#An excellent recipe. I like to try new recipes when I have just a cup or so of whole milk remaining, just to see what I can accomplish. I'm rarely disappointed, and a search today led me to this one - which I will keep. It is amazing. Will top some pieces with some raspberries that I froze at the end of the season last year (the canes are already getting ready to produce a new crop) and we will enjoy it this evening. Thank you. 
Hot Milk Cake#17#5#So good!!! You can probably get away with putting less sugar in it if you wanted, but how much less I don't know! I had to bake it about 10 mins longer than stated, but my dad said it's the best white cake he's ever had! Yes I know it's not white cake but it's similar!!!!
Hot Milk Cake#10#0#Seriously easy, super tasty, and the perfect way to use up close-to-date milk. I've used whole and 2% with perfect success. Our kids are wild about this cake...especially when paired with a warm caramel sauce. This one is a keeper!
Hot Milk Cake#5#2#does it has to be done 2% milk? can it be whole?
Hot Milk Cake#39#4#can you make this in a bundt or tube pan? i want to make this tomorrow so if anyone knows please respond asap- thank you!!
Hot Milk Cake#7#2#Hi, ilI wanted to try this cake, just wanted to ask the cup size what is it in grams? And also I have a gas cooker so what will be the gas mark for baking it?
Hot Milk Cake#1#1#This is a great cake for strawberry shortcake. We usually prefer biscuits but this cake is a nice change. I reduce the sugar just a bit (1/8 cup less) as it's a bit sweet. I also add a pinch of salt. I bake in a 9 inch pan for 25 minutes (check with a toothpick 5 minutes before the directions state - you don't want a dry cake). When I sugar my strawberries, I keep them a bit tart to offset the sweetness of the cake. This is a little bit fussy but it really is a delicious cake! 
Hot Milk Cake#10#0#Not sure what all the negative comments are about. I baked this with very little skill and it turned out absolutely perfect! the cake was so soft and wonderful. the only thing I did was reduce the sugar to 1 and 1/4 cup because i frosted the cake. Please do bake this cake :) its such a great ,simple and delicious one
Hot Milk Cake#9#3#I have used this recipe many times for layer cakes for my kids' birthdays. I have added a pinch of salt a few times, other times I have poked holes with a chopstick and poured in jello, and I have at times dumped a bunch of cocoa powder in with the dry ingredients. They have all turned out great! I like this cake because it is structurally sound and can withstand icing like a champ. Use a long bread knife to slice off the slight dome. When I use buttercream I do a thin crumb coat, stick it in the fridge, wash a couple of dishes and then the do the real icing. Beautiful every time!
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I realized I never reviewed this recipe and what an oversight that was! This cake is amazing! So easy too!
Hot Milk Cake#6#1#Delicious and different as I was not prepared for the sponge-like texture. Served with lemon curd and whipped cream. As with most cake recipes I come across and don't see salt, I added about 1/3 tsp plus used one (1) Tbsp high quality vanilla. After greasing glass cake pan, I sprinkled it with sugar before adding batter. And, for me cake took longer to bake than 30 minutes while increased baking time gradually. This cake could definitely be substituted for the biscuits in shortcake. Yum! 
Hot Milk Cake#3#3#I made this once and it turned out amazing. I have a terrible oven so I set it to 300 and it took longer but worked out. I topped mine with strawberry Jam. Has anyone tried making this into a cupcake?
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#I have made this cake multiple times and my family loves it. I topped it with strawberries and some whip cream and it is an instant success.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Healthy Recipe..Thank you.
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#This is an excellent cake. Very tasty, goes really well with Strawberries
Hot Milk Cake#3#0#What a delicious cake! I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9 inch round cake pan. I baked it 25 mins. Probably could have used another couple of minutes. And I should have used butter and flour in the pan instead of spray (it did stick). But my son and I were instantly addicted! My only changes were using whole milk (all I had) and adding a pinch of salt (and btw...I also used regular salted butter too). This came together so quickly! And it is perfect eaten warm!
Hot Milk Cake#6#2#I made this cake for the first time many years ago when my children still lived at home. I took it out of the oven and my husband and I had a piece and loved it. Then our son and his friend and our daughter came home from high school. They tried it and loved it. Then a friend stopped by to drop something off. She tried it and loved it as well. I'm so glad I still have the recipe 
Hot Milk Cake#3#0#Delicious. And yes, I beat the eggs for 5 full minutes!
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#Halved the recipe and made it to accompany strawberries and and whipped cream. It was excellent! Not too sweet and nice and moist. Will definitely use this one again and again.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Love it! So easy and delicious
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I followed the recipe exactly as written and the cake turned out beautifully. It was light and tasty. It's not a strong flavored cake, but a great light snack or a wonderful dessert with some fruit added to it. My husband said that in the words of the Great British Baking Show, it's a beautiful sponge ! I will definitely make this cake again. Sometimes I'll make it as is and sometimes I'll play around and add flavors to it or a topping of some kind. This is a great cake recipe. 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#Really good tasting cake but set your timer for 25 minutes for testing if finished. Ours baked for 30, stuck to the pan and candies on the perimeter. I'm going to try this one again because it's delish!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Very yummy! A nice combination of moist and light. I wish I had fresh strawberries, because they would have complimented this perfectly. I will definitely make this again for a quick, easy, simple and delicious dessert.
Hot Milk Cake#5#0#I remember my mama making this cake. It is basic and tasty, more of a pound cake than a fluffy cake and really good for snacking. She would sometimes frost with buttercream and sprinkle heavily with chopped peanuts. Sure does bring back memories. 
Hot Milk Cake#19#3#If you follow this recipe, you'll get a cake that's pretty dense. The recipe has the right ingredients but the wrong steps for a fluffy cake. Only use a mixer to beat the eggs and sugar. After that, use a spatula to mix everything else in, because if you continue to use a mixer you'll beat out a lot of air bubbles from the mixture, which will make it less fluffy. Also add the milk and butter before the flour, because adding the flour first will make the mixture so dense that it will push out the air from the mixture. If you prefer something less sweet, use 1.25 cups of sugar instead of 2. You could also melt the butter first, before stirring in the milk, just to make it melt faster. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Fabulous! I didn't change a thing! I put whipped topping and fresh strawberries on top. My husband LOVED it! Thank you! 
Hot Milk Cake#4#0#Well I made the recipe tonight. Nice basic ingredients that I already had, and a simple recipe. Wanted to start a little tradition with my young daughters that they could pass on making a simple cake from scratch. While it was a little sweet for my own taste, they absolutely loved it. The texture was spongy and moist, and the plain cake was a hit solo. I also made a berry compote to add a bit of tartness for my own preference (and my mom's) and the girls loved that too. I guess the key is in proper mixing. Not a fake review! There were a couple negative reviews from so-called baking professionals that said the cake turned out awful or that the positive reviews were not genuine. Real mom here.
Hot Milk Cake#6#0#This cake came out exactly as I expected it would. The negative reviews , I imagine, come from negative haters. Some people are only happy when ripping others down. My suggestion is to learn how to bake before you comment. Delicious cake and I'm looking forward to some truffle tonight!
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#Just made it but didn't follow the instructions due to habit I mixed all dry ingredients before I realized that wasn't the way, but I added them slowly to the batter and it came out perfectly and is delicious ??
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I followed the recipe exactly as stated but I did add more vanilla, and it was delicious, will definitely make again, I served mine with fresh berries and whip cream.
Hot Milk Cake#10#0#I am 81 an have been baking this cake since I was 12. I have never had it to fail...ever!! About 40 years ago, I started adding a broiled topping and serving with whipped cream. It is delicious and loved at the church and quilt potlucks. Here is broiled topping: 1-1/2 C packed brown sugar,3/4 C butter, 1/2 C half and half. Bring to a boil and stir until sugar is dissolved. Remove and add 2 C coconut and 1/2 C chopped nuts. Broil until bubbly and lightly browned. Make this in the morning so that the topping flavors can meld into the cake.
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#After reading the reviews I changed this around. I added a T of vanilla bean paste plus the t of vanilla. I used half and half instead of 2%. I beat the eggs a long time until they were light and fluffy and then added the sugar and beat again until light and fluffy for quite a bit. My batter was smooth and creamy. I baked this in a glass baking dish so I reduced my oven temp to 335. When it was done and cooled I made a fresh blueberry compote to serve on top with a dollop of homemade whipped cream but refrigerated whipped topping would work just as well. I liked it because it's a light dessert without heavy frosting to hold it down. Perfect for a light spring or summer supper.
Hot Milk Cake#7#0#I'am 79. We had this cake all the time when I was little. Don' to know where my mother got this. I still make this now and my kids and grandkids love it. The only differents I use 2cups flour, 2teaspoon baking soda, 1teaspoon salt mix together, 2 cups sugar and 2 eggs mix this together, 1 cup milk 1tablespoon crisco shortening, melt crisco in milk. Alternate flour mixture and milk. Do not beat, mix well. 375 oven, 25mins. Test at 20 mins. Test with toothpick. Now we only made a layer cake. Always this chocolate frosting. 4 Tablespoon butter, 4 ounces unsweetened Hershey's chocolate, melt together. 3cups sifted confectioners sugar, 1teaspoon vanilla, 1/8 teaspoon salt. 1/3 cup warm milk. Add not all milk at once to sugar and chocolate mix now add rest of milk. Frost cake, serve warm. My mom always put 4 toothpicks to hold cake together, who ever gat a toothpick got another piece of cake. This tradition still goes own. ENJOY! Sandra
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#I cannot understand how anyone can have a failure with this recipe. I've been using it for a number of years and it always turns out as shown. In fact, I made it a few days ago and have given the recipe to two friends because they liked it so well. 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I love this cake. It's the perfect base for strawberry shortcake, or for a topping of any fruit with whipped cream. Leftovers are great with a cup of coffee in the morning. I don't understand those who had trouble, but cakes are one of those things that you have to follow instructions carefully. 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I'm not sure what the others did wrong, but this is an awesome recipe! 
Hot Milk Cake#3#0#Damien, you made my day! Your statement that some of these folks just can't cook or bake. I am surprised and disappointed at the venom some of these posters spray. Everyone likes different tastes. I don't understand the hatefulness expressed. I guess since people can't be identified they feel they can say such hateful things about someone's recipe. If you do care for a recipe, you don't care for it. Plain and simple. Move on and try another recipe.
Hot Milk Cake#3#1#Easy recipe. Great when fresh strawberries are available, ( or peaches or cherries) Scrape bowl often when adding flour or milk mixture. Added 1 teaspoon of grated lemon rind with vanilla, nice flavor. Sister likes it with grated orange rind. Use non-stick foil in pan. Grab foil and place on cutting board when done. No need to clean a pan.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#My mom has the same recipe but we put chocolate whip cream frosting on it. We make it for birthday dinners.
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I am anxious to try this recipe. The one I have made for years and years calls for 2 cups flour, 1 cup milk and 1 stick of butter. Always use butter and flour to grease the pan, never a cooking spray as the cake will not rise properly. Maybe this is the problem for some of the bakers.
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#Made this cake today, was pretty simple to make, served it as a strawberry shortcake, I think the cake would also be wonderful to use in a trifle. I will save it and make it again.
Hot Milk Cake#0#6#Disgusting. Didn't set properly and had to throw it away. Waste of Ingredients. I ignored the bad reviews and thought I could make it work, but it turned out rubbish! Definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND. Use another recipe
Hot Milk Cake#4#0#It came out exactly as described. The negative comments, I'd hazard to guess... just can't cook. That said, I didn't particularly like it, but what do you really expect to get from a Hot Milk Cake FFS? 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#This is a humble cake. And, it is delicious. I have made it numerous times and it comes out perfectly every time. I don't understand how it doesn't come out for others. I make a could of small tweaks. I use unsalted butter for all of my baking, so I added a teaspoon of salt and whisked it together with the flour, baking power and salt before adding them to the batter. I used twice the vanilla. Also, I think it makes a big difference if you add ingredients very gradually. Make sure an addition of flour is almost completely incorporated before adding the next. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#11#VERY BAD EXPERIENCE. DO NOT TRY. the batter was so lumpy even though i used everything stated above with exact quantity. then when i baked it, it didn't even rise properly and tasted gross. i've been making hot milk cake with a different recipe but i wanted to try a new recipe and now regretting my decision.
Hot Milk Cake#0#9#Ok it looks white and tastes good but I don't like the inside at all I hate it nasty nasty white cake ever 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#Perfect recipe, just follow the procedure and yoi will get a fluffy tasty cake, kids so loved it....
Hot Milk Cake#3#0#currently on quarantine lockdown and tired of looking at the same walls. went to my cupboards and found i had all ingredients on hand. i accidentally added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and combined all the dry ingredients out of habit. turned out wonderful! adding this to regular rotation.
Hot Milk Cake#0#9#Absolutely horrible cake recipe! I've been baking for a long time and this has to be the worst cake recipe I've ever tried. A total waste of ingredients. I followed the recipe to a T, didn't over mix/ over fold and it had the worst texture! Very dense and almost gummy feeling. I wish I could give this 0 stars. This is the first time I've been truly disappointed by a recipe on this site. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This came out beautiful and fluffy and moist and delicious. I am not a professional baker just a hobby from home and had no problems with the recipe and directions. I will have to make this over and over again.
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#This is a real review. :-) I've been making this exact recipe for many, many years. At one time, I would bake two to feed my family of seven; however, with just me and my husband now, I cut the recipe in half and use a 9x9 pan. This is my definite go-to recipe for (many) strawberry shortcake every summer....but love just as much plain, out of the oven, with powdered sugar sprinkled on top. Chances are you have every ingredient at home and can whip this up in no time. Why look for another recipe when you've got the best, right here!! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#6#Disappointing. This recipe calls more liquid than most of other hot milk cake recipes. Because of numerous good reviews, I didn't doubt to try it. I baked twice, followed the exact method, exact scale of ingredients, but both didn't turn out well. (Note that I didn't overwhip the eggs or overfold. I went to a baking academy, and I've been baking for more than 5 years.) If you're looking for fluffy hot milk cake, definitely do not try this recipe. If you're up to really dense, dense, cake, maybe you could try this recipe. Maybe this is why you shouldn't take recipes from the internet, I highly doubt these good reviews are real as the youtube views for this recipe is considered low. I won't be making these again. I'll try to find other hot milk cake recipes. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#good, amazing and fun
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#This cake was a bit too sweet on its own for me, Maybe I didn't incorporate the sugar enough, will definitely try again though as it's a great tasting cake. With this sweet batch I ended up layering it with thickened cream and coffee and made a tiramisu it was delicious!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#So gorgeous.....
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Delicious!!!!!
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#Loved it. 2nd time I varied the recipe a little: more vanilla and 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk, beat the whites, replaced the white volume with water to make the batter, folded in the whites. It's just as delicious, but substantially lighter with out losing the creamy ness.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I live in Colorado at high altitude
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#My cake didn't rise. Isn't baking soda needed for helping to rise? I didn't see that in the receipe 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#good &lt;a href= https://scoopkeeda.com/video-banane-wala-apps-download/ target= _blank &gt;information&lt;/a&gt; I need deep recipe about this 
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#This is an excellent cake. Made it just as recipe instructed. You need to have oven preheated when making this cake. It needs to go into the oven as quickly as possible, while the batter is still warm. I think it rises better that way.
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#Quick and easy to make. I used chai instead of milk to turn it into a chai cake. I added some spices with the dry ingredients too. It's a bit sweet, so I paired it with a less sweet icing. I think cream cheese icing or icing made of instant pudding mix and thickened cream would be nice. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This cake is so easy to make! It's top off a meal nicely. Old-fashioned goodness!! 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#My mother made this when I was growing up in the'30s &'40s; her recipe is almost exactly the same as this one. She filled the layers and topped the cake with what I know now was a thick lemon curd. Delicious! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This recipe has become a family favorite. I'm making it today for my daughter's 22nd birthday. When I told her, she was overjoyed! This cake is absolutely delicious. No frosting at all. It's so quick to make that I can throw it into the oven after dinner, and have a delicious dessert in no time. I don't let it cool too much, because we think it tastes best when it is hot. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Made this cake. It was great. Topped it with brown sugar frosting. Everyone loves it. Everyone must try brown sugar frosting. Just cut the powdered sugar in half and it has the perfect amount of sweetness.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Wow! I was very impressed with the texture and taste of this cake. It was great served with fresh fruit and next time I may serve it with lemon curd. Sooo easy !!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I just tried it and it is amazing, however I used self-raising flour and baking powder and it came soft like a chiffon cake. Simply amazing
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I have made this cake for years as my base for Trifle. I split the cake in half and place in bottom of glass bowl, sprinkle with a liqueur that matches my fruit, cover with jam or cooked fruit, add pudding and repeat layers then cover with sweetened whipped cream. It always disappears quickly.
Hot Milk Cake#1#1#Very disappointed with this recipe. I bake a lot and this recipe looked very interesting, but not what I expected, it was very dense, I was expecting it to be much lighter. I followed the recipe exactly. If you want light and fluffy and moist, this is not the cake for you.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This cake brings bake so many sweet childhood memories when my family was so close. My aunt France's use to make got milk cake 27th walnuts inside and chocolate icing...that was my favorite part of the holidays...I. Still make them...cooking one tidat!!! 
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#The first time that I made this cake, I used all purpose flour and all I could taste was the flour. The cake was dense even though it rose beautifully. The second time that I made this cake, I used Swans Down Cake Flour and it made a huge difference in the flavor and the texture! I also used this recipe to make 36 cupcakes. I baked them at 325 degrees for exactly 20 minutes and they came out perfect! This is going to be my go to recipe every time I make a cake or cupcakes! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I just made my moms recipe for hot milk cake and decided to search for variations. I was reading the reviews and I just wanted to take the time to say please do not follow the advice given by Jacksjojo. I wish there was a way to report it. You cannot can anything with eggs, milk, or flour. Even if you could these directions are not an appropriate way of canning. Just because the lid seals does not mean that is safe. You could potentially die of botulism or worse kill someone else when you give it as a gift.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Love homemade milk cake!
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I have been making this cake for over 25 years ... it is one of my husband's favorites ... I do use salted Butter ... if you don't have salted butter just add 1/2 tsp salt ... and I use 1 TBS of Vanilla. The mixture is thin! BUT it works perfectly. I usually make it in a Bundt Pan , just because we like it that way. Too thin for a Tube Pan ... I like to make this to add to Gift Baskets. Use 6 to 7 PINT size wide mouth jars, Grease inside, fill about 2/3 full place on a pan to bake @ 350 about 18 mins. or until touch test works. Place lids and rings on as soon as you can after removing from the oven, they will seal ... tighten after jars have cooled ... if sealed they will be GOOD for at 2-3 months in cabinet. Enjoy!I have tried to give this 5 Stars ... But it just won't let me ... Could be me! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#My grandmother made a cake very similar to this which she topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. When I saw fresh strawberries on special yesterday at the grocery store, I thought of her cake and found this recipe. The taste and smell were so familiar! The recipe was easy to make and tasted great. I also served some of the cake topped with chocolate icing and it was fantastic too. This recipe will become a permanent addition to my recipe collection! It's very versatile and oh so easy and tasty. 
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#I poked holes n the top of the cake and poured some cream of coconut over the top... oh so moist! I did a change tho' - I didn't put 2 cups of sugar in it (i is a diabetic) - I used 1 cup of sugar - had rave reviews from every1! loved it... 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Delicious! Easy too. I would like to hear about some different frosting ideas for it. I did like it plain and also with a little powdered sugar. I'm just curious. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I got the credit of making a tasty cake
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is the perfect cake to top with your favorite fruit topping. I take it to almost every summer time picnic and it never fails to disappear.
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#I am 71 and this was my favorite cake growing up. This was the base for our strawberry shortcake. My mother also made it with a maple fudge frosting which I loved. When I started to make it at age 10, my mother couldn't understand why mine always tasted better than hers. We found out why, years later, when I discovered that I had mis-read her recipe and was adding twice the butter! To this day, I still mis-read her recipe.....yummmmm. 
Hot Milk Cake#3#0#My mom had made this cake for many, many years, it was one of her recipes, that relatives new she would bring to a shower, or to a special family gathering. She made a hot brown sugar sauce for the topping on the cake. for an after Sunday dinner desert, or sometimes with boiled frosting ..... We were always wondering, when she made it , was this cake for us, or was it leaving the house.....comfort food from our childhood I guess.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Simple and delicious! Simply delicious! Definitely a keeper, I followed this recipe to the T and it is fabulous. We will enjoy this for many years to come.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Great Cake, works every time, now make it as muffins as everyone wants more, makes 24 so enough for everyone
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#This is an excellent cake for a pineapple or peach upside own cake. Not too heavy, and it makes enough batter for two cakes. Or make the second cake into something else, like Boston Cream Cake.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Nice
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#My family loved it. I wasn't sure it would turn out but it was delicious. I served it with chocolate ice cream. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Do you use salted or unsalted butter? Also, someone mentioned that it's better with salt, but I don't see salt listed in the ingredients. Do you add salt? Thanks 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is d Best Cake Ever..love D Recipe..
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#We have been making hot milk cakes in our family for more than 75 years. It is an easy tasty cake and you can add coco powder 1\2 cup or more to taste and make a chocolate hot milk cake! Delicious!
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I followed the instruction exactly like it was written without adding any salt! The results were still great though I would agree to add a little salt next time! Could be as a base for any birthday cake with any thing/flavour added! Spongy and moist at the same time! I will make it again for sure!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#LOVE the recipe!!! Its a keeper! Will make often and don't see why some people don't like it. Crazy! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Very yummy and so easy! I only used 1 & 1/2 C sugar and added 2 tsp vanilla and a little salt. It has a great consistency. Thanks for sharing - this will be one of our favorites now!!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is pretty decent but the Magnolia Bakery's Vanilla Birthday Cake is very similar to this and I do like the texture better. I would make this again though, it is quick and easy to make. 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I thought this cake was really easy to make and came out great! The texture is both spongy and slightly dense at the same time. I followed other reviewers' suggestions to add a smidge more vanilla and a pinch of salt. I did also add about 1/2 tsp. of rum extract because I thought the batter tasted good, but needed a little... something! You could really use this cake as a base and add any type of extract or flavoring you're in the mood for. I also agree with the others who said it's very important to beat the eggs for the full 5 minutes, maybe even a little longer. I also made sure I beat the sugar and eggs until they were nice and airy too. 35 minutes in the oven was perfect. The cake tastes great on its own--especially when it's still warm--but I plan on serving it with strawberries and fresh whipped cream later. Can't wait! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#Great recipe but with the omissions I deleted 2 stars. For taste I would give it 4. I am an experienced baker and made this recipe as written except for the notes I made below.If someone were a novice baker this should be a simple enough recipe, but it will not turn out as expected unless you recognize and/or correct the following:Salt: Salt is necessary UNLESS you are using salted butter. Most people bake with unsalted butter since it allows the baker to control the salt in the recipe. This recipe may have been written for use with salted butter, but since it is not noted to use salted butter instead of the usual unsalted, it will come out bland without the addition of salt. I added 1/2 tsp and it came out perfect.Batter: My batter was unusually runny, I would even call it watery. I have made cakes with very runny batter previously, but I was unsure if this was one of those super moist types since the recipe didn't mention the consistency of the batter. I added 1/2 cup of ap flour just to be on the safe side and it came out very dense and moist without a lot of rise. Your results may vary, however. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is to DIE for!! I don't know what happened to the others that said this had no flavor as it is so sweet and delicious! Now I just need some strawberries! YUM! Thanks for the fantastic recipe. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Great recipe ....I made it tonight and the cake came out delicious
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Loved it! Very easy to make, light & fluffy!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Simple, old-fashioned, delicious cake. Would be great to use for strawberry shortcake as others have mentioned. Somewhat reminiscent of a GOOD Twinkie sponge. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is a great recipe,. Adding some lemon zest gives a nice light lemon taste. Top with berries and cream, or cinnamon and sugar. yummmm I love this cake. Very easy to make and flavor anyway you please.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#awesome
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This cake is delicious as a snack cake without frosting or topping because it is more dense than regular cake. We like to use this recipe for strawberry shortcake. It is so-o-o good!
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I never add baking soda or powder to my baked good because it makes it taste like soap so I didn't add it. It's similar to pound cake, very moist. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Did not like this one.
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#I was hoping that this recipe would be a real winner being that it got previous rave reviews, but I was very disappointed. This cake lacked in flavor and sweetness and was too dense. The only saving grace was the frosting, but then we decided that it still wasn't worth it so it went into the trash. Back to the drawing board! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#expellant recipe
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#u need to mix the eggs really good and the sugar we loved the cake
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I made this yesterday. If it wasn't for the chocolate frosting, I would of thrown it out. It is so heavy and not much flavor to it. We didn't like it. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I have been making this cake for over 30 years or more. It is my daughters favorite and always asked for it for her Birthday cake. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Grandma cake! Add cinnamon, or whatever spice you like. ......
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Super easy and super fun to make... YummyMy first cake... Enjoyed the experienceIt was just perfect!!!!
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#was easy and definitely yummy.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Perfect. I've used it for over 20 years 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This cake was so easy to make and very tasty. I only had skim milk and it turned out great. My girlfriend loves cake but doesn't like frosting so i was trying to find something tasty enough for me to enjoy and this was it. I think it would be good drizzled with maple syrup or corn syrup though and dusted with a little powder sugar if you wanted to dress it up. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This was a fun cake to make,very simply and very good. Didn't miss the frosting at all! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I tried this recipe today. It turned out good & was very Delish!!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#it tastes so good and so easy to make
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I can remember my Mom baking Hot Milk cake ..she would spread Karo syrup on top it was so delicious
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#i added a little of canolli dip in to it and its ,amazingly good
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#We love this cake. It has been our family birthday cake for as long as I can remember. Everyone loves it.I use Almond instead of Vanilla. Usually serve it plain, but sometimes dust it with powdered sugar.I've been making this cake since I was old enough to be in the kitchen. I'm well past retirement age now. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#very nice and fluffy. my family loved it. soft and spongy. I added 3 tablespoons of coco powder to theflour and it turned out really well. thanks for such sweet recipe.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#i tried this recipe and it came so good , perfect for my daughter, thanks for sharing... im planning to add more butter next time ill make this to have more butter taste :) and to add more vanilla and salt too same as the other did to their cake
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I tried this recipe and it turned out very nice and tasty.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Awesome!!! lovely texture, flavor and crumb!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#When you're raising 6 kids, you need lots of delicious, inexpensive recipes to fill up all those tummies! This recipe was one of our family's favorites when all the kids were growing up. So easy to top it with fruit to make it a little more special. But, everyone loved it just as it is! Easy to make & delicious! 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#literally just finished cooking it, definately came out light and fluffy, inlove with this cake already!! added blue food colouring to make it a little different and after reading some reviews, i ended up adding 1/4 salt and it came out perfect. Thanks to everyone for their reviews, it really made the cake work :)
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is a great cake, very moist and flavorful. It does need to cook longer than the directions say, at least in my oven. Don't rely on the toothpick test or it won't be cooked. It should spring back if you touch it, the top should be golden brown, and then it's done. I used boiled peanut butter frosting which was more like fudge. It was for a family birthday party and it disappeared fast. 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I tried this recipe and it came out really well. I was short of 1 egg but the outcome was still good. Thanks for sharing!!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I think what the reviews with low stars are missing is QUALITY ingredients. The first time I made this, I made no alterations and it was perfect. I topped with some homemade peach marmalade and that added just enough sweetness that coffee goes perfect with it. Now, I do use farm fresh eggs, fresh dairy milk and fresh dairy butter, so I'm thinking that that has something to do with it. With old recipes, it makes a huge difference. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Read the reviews and was a little nervous to make this. I added the 1/4 tsp of salt and I changed the vanilla to 2 Tablespoons. It turned out very good. It's a good base cake . Plenty of options came to mind after I tasted it. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This cake is awesome. I did add 1/4 tsp. salt to the recipe & increased vanilla to about 2 tsp. Sprinkled with powdered sugar & served with fresh strawberries and cream. Unbelievably delicious. Sometimes I want sweet - but not too sweet - this does it. I like this better than pound cake because it's lighter & softer. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#My granny made this cake all the time for my pappy. It was from scratch & made in a pyrex bowl. (smaller scale) But what she did that made it so great was to add while hot, the coconut and brown sugar icing. While the cake is baking, in a pan she melted 6 T butter, 3/4 c brown sugar, 3 T. milk and 1/2 to 1 c. coconut. Bring to a boiling point and pour over the warm cake. I punch holes in mine to let it seep in. Heaven! I have to tell you that I have looked for this recipe for years and this is as close to my granny's as you can get. Thank you for the recipe. So to those ladies who complained, sorry but cake is priceless to me. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#(3 stars to make a comment) No salt? I've been comparing this recipe to many others on the internet and this is the only one without salt. I would guess this is why some other reviewers find this cake bland. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#Extremely plain and flavorless. I have a favorite yellow cake recipe but always like to try new things just in case something better might come along. This was disappointing to say the least. I even added extra vanilla and a touch of cinnamon because the batter tasted like a boxed pancake mix and I always spice up my pancakes. If you like plain bland cake then this is for you.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Always requested by my children for their birthdays since it first came out in TOH in 1993. Truly delicious, especially hot out of the oven. I look forward to making it for my grandchildren someday. If you're looking for something especially sweet, this isn't it. To me, this is more like the flavor of a shortbread cookie. Great with a hot cup of tea, as one reviewer commented. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#good for my homework on a recipe with milk. i have tasted this and it is good.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Made this cake yesterday. Very easy to make and is absolutely delicious. I served it with strawberries and my husband loved it. I will be making this one again.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#could you tell me if you have ever put this in a bundt pan instead of the 13x9 pan?
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Great cake, just like mother used to make
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Just baked this cake and my husband loved it. It was very easy to make and delicious too.
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#I JUST HAD A QUESTION, BUT HAD TO ADD A STAR TO ASK IT SO I GAVE IT 1 STAR. DO YOU THINK THIS WOULD BE A GOOD BASE FOR TRES LECHES CAKE?
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I searched out this recipe because it's an old favourite of my husbands. His mom made it often and he missed it. He loved this and said it was even BETTER than his moms! You have to know what kind of untouchable reputation his mom has in his mind for baking to know what compliment this is lol! The only thing I didn't different was use lemon extract instead of vanilla and made a simple glaze with lemon zest in it. I think that the people that have bad reviews maybe over heated the milk which destroys the entire cake. 
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#I have made this cake on several occassions and it is a fantastic cake! It's halfway between a sponge and a pound cake. It's also a great base for cakes as suggested by others. I cannot believe some people think it's an awful cake! I have suggested this recipe to many people when they comment on how nice it is. Definitely worth a try! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Tender and moist... the very best cake for strawberry shortcake I've ever tried. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#It is a Great cake but as a coffee cake or base of lemon curd cake. pineapple upside down cake, or Strawberry shortcake. I will make it again!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#We've used this recipe for years for strawberry shortcake. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I was so excited to try this cake. Followed the recipe to a T. I cannot understand why it has good reviews...it is horrible. Utterly horrible. I would not recommend this to anyone. I cook all the time, in case anyone thinks I am a newbie...I am not. this recipe just is not worth making. Awful.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#it's so delicious , my kids just loved it,,,,,,,, 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Easy to make. Looks exactly like the picture. Taste is sweet and blah.
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#This was not one of my favorite cake recipes.
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#This was not one of my favorite cakes.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I made this cake for my husband's birthday. When I read the recipe, I was skeptical, as I had never heard of hot milk cake. I decided to try it because of all the great reviews. It was a bit more work than my usual yellow cake recipe, but it was well worth it! This is the fluffiest cake I have ever made. It was moist and light. I followed the recipe exactly. I think that beating the eggs for the full five minutes is essential. I made two 8x8 cakes and froze one for another day. I served the other one with fresh strawberries and light whipped cream. My husband raved about it. This is my new favourite cake recipe! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#love this cake!!!
