Creamy White Chili#0#0#I tweaked it a little, removed onions because of onion haters in my house, used Italian seasoning instead of just oregano, and use a paprika/ cayenne mix and a little more than the recipe called for.. we like everything a bit more hot. The chili was amazing! It was easy to make and everyone absolutely loved it. It will now be a staple meal in our house.
Creamy White Chili#7#0#Bush used to have a white chili bean and it made this recipe super simple. I've written to them and asked them to please!, bring them back
Creamy White Chili#3#0#I have a very complicated white chicken chili recipe that I have made for years. Everyone raves over it. I saw this recipe and thought I'd try it as an easy alternative for weeknights. My husband likes this recipe better! Super easy and delicious! I did cut back slightly on the crushed oregano and cayenne pepper, otherwise I made it exactly as written.
Creamy White Chili#2#0#In your introduction, you mentioned cream cheese but there is none listed in the ingredients!
Creamy White Chili#7#0#Wonderful! I made this for a Chili/Stew night dinner at our church and everyone wanted the recipe. We make it quite often at home and it's always a hit. I also use a freshly made rotisserie chicken which adds to the flavor. 
Creamy White Chili#3#1#amazing! my boyfriend loved it so much! going to make it again this week!
Creamy White Chili#11#0#Wow!!! This recipe is excellent as written!! The only change I made was that I used a 40 oz. jar of great northern beans. It tastes so good, with just the right amount of heat!!!
Creamy White Chili#28#2#This is delicious and I make it often. One such time was when our daughter, her husband and their two sons were visiting us from Virginia. I made a double batch and served it for dinner one evening and it really made a hit. Since there was a small amount left I put the leftover in the refrigerator. I walked into the kitchen the next morning to see our son in law with a big bowl of it headed for the microwave, which puzzled me. He gave me a big smile and told me it was the first thing he thought of when he woke up that morning and that was his breakfast. I give this soup 5 stars!
Creamy White Chili#6#0#I absolutely love this recipe. I've tweaked it quite a bit. When I want a spicier chili, I exchange the green chilis for canned diced jalapenos. It's SO GOOD that way. I also add an extra 4oz can of green chilis/diced jalapenos to it every time I make it. It does not double well, but have made 1.5 times the recipe and it's great for extra large crowds/plenty of leftovers. It's a great snow day recipe, I've made it 3 times these past 2 weeks! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I make this a lot my kids and there friends come over and ask me to make this all the time ..
Creamy White Chili#3#0#Best and easiest white chili recipe.
Creamy White Chili#2#1#Best white chili recipe I've had! I served it up with Fritos, sharp cheddar, sour cream, and chopped green onions. Delish! 
Creamy White Chili#1#0#This recipe was excellent!! I added the cream cheese and it was the perfect comfort food. I usually make individual portions and freeze it, but this was eaten everyday for 3 days. Exceptional!
Creamy White Chili#4#2#I made this alongside a traditional chili for a winter gathering and this chili stole the show. I was expecting leftovers for additional meals during the week, but nope, no leftovers. It's mild, but there's always ways to spice it up if that's your preference. If you're thinking about it, just do it! It's easy, fast, warming, and delicious. Oh, and might as well double it. I did.
Creamy White Chili#5#1#Fantastic, but mild. I added half a Carolina Reaper. Delish! The hubby said he detested white chili. As this was simmering, hubby said Boy, that sure smells great! When do we eat? He asked me to make more to freeze for later. LOL! 
Creamy White Chili#1#0#This is a fabulous recipe!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Delicious, If you like a mild chilli taste this is for you!?? really would recommend making it!
Creamy White Chili#3#0#made according to directions, DELISH!!!!
Creamy White Chili#3#0#My new favorite soup! Oh my! So delicious!
Creamy White Chili#11#1#This is a hit in my house. I have been making it for a few years now. I typically double the recipe as written, adding only a can or two of sweet corn. We always eat this with jiffy cornbread. Absolutely a favorite.
Creamy White Chili#6#1#Delicious!!! A huge hit with family and friends. Several requests to make again. And share recipe!!!Thank you!!!! 
Creamy White Chili#7#0#This is our go-to chicken chili recipe and has been for years. We love it and it's so simple. 
Creamy White Chili#5#5#Very good!! Easy recipe first time followed exactly but I added flour to chicken and onion mixture to help thicken and did not add cream cheese. Made a second time with no mild chilies and only a few shakes of cayenne and it was still good! Liked it less spicy! But will make again! Other in family liked it too!
Creamy White Chili#5#29#This is just White Chicken Chili with I first experinced eating at at local restaurant in Indianapolis which was recommended to me by the waiter. It's delicious! But that is what it is called - White Chicken Chili. 
Creamy White Chili#15#1#WOW! Total WOW! Totally delicious. 5 stars plus.
Creamy White Chili#16#5#Wonderful recipe as written! Only change I made was I used rotisserie chicken because I always have it on hand in my freezer as a time saver. Even my husband who said chili can't be white said to make sure to keep this recipe! Thanks Laura for making him a believer! 
Creamy White Chili#17#1#I make this for my son-in-law for when he has to work cold winter nights in Michigan. He loves it! Instead of green chiles, I changed to Hatch Green Chiles to give it a little kick. You can use as much or as little depending on how you like it.
Creamy White Chili#4#0#EXCELLENT RECIPE!! This will be on regular rotation.
Creamy White Chili#19#5#I don't change a thing in this recipe, it'sperfect as directed. I found it in my Taste of Home cookbook years ago and have been making it ever since. I don't even look for other recipes because why mess with perfection. I was just diagnosed with gluten intolerance and thankfully this recipe is. *** my ex-husband would not eat chicken so my son made it with pork (also delicious). He still used chicken stock but the ex didn't know that! *** 
Creamy White Chili#3#0#I would make this soup again. It was a hit. I would only add 1 can of green chilis when I make it again. The leftovers were pretty hot.
Creamy White Chili#6#0#This was absolutely DELICIOUS! It was my first time making chili, and I loved it. It turned out a lot more soupy than I expected, and I even mashed up a cup of the beans like the recipe said. I think next time I make this, I won't add the cream to see 9f that makes thicker. But is super yummy, even if it is more of a soup/stew. ? Yummm! 
Creamy White Chili#3#0#Outstanding just the way it is!
Creamy White Chili#8#6#I've made this chili for several years and follow the recipe as written. I use chicken tenderloins and heavy cream and sour cream. If it's not broken don't fix it. It's the perfect comfort food on a cold day! The tortilla chips go perfectly and a grilled cheese on the side doesn't hurt either (especially if made with home made pimento cheese)!
Creamy White Chili#35#19#This is the best chili recipe, I have gotten 3 blue ribbons making it for company cook offs, Last year mad it for a Halloween party and it got RAVE reviews, this year the party was banned 9but we had it anyway) and the local police officer came to the party in the uniform and said I won't say anything if I get some of that chili you made last year . LOL 
Creamy White Chili#6#1#This was EXCELLENT! I only had 1 can of chili's so I opened a can of jalapenos and added a teaspoon. I threw it all in the Ninja Foodie and put it under pressure for 20 mins with quick release. THEN I added the sour cream and whipping cream. I served with crisp tortillas and shredded cheese. It was loved by all, even my granddaughter. I will be making this again! Oh, I didn't have great northern beans so I used two cans of white beans. Turned out perfect.
Creamy White Chili#3#0#This is one of the few recipes I use where I don't change the ingredients. Love it.
Creamy White Chili#5#4#I didn't see cream cheese in the recipe, but it was in the description so I added it toward the end. I added a little Adobo seasoning and used my own dried cayenne, also added diced tomatoes with green chili's, otherwise made the recipe as written. It was fabulous. A forever keeper. Thank you!! 
Creamy White Chili#6#3#been making this for my family for a couple decades now, and it's always gotten rave reviews. I do add real garlic along with the chicken, garlic powder, and onion to sauté, before adding the rest of the ingredients. In the past I've substituted evaporated skim milk for the heavy cream, and it turns out well that way, too. I cut back on the cayenne for my own reasons, but my daughter loved it full strength. Probably going to be making this recipe for another couple decades as well. 
Creamy White Chili#3#1#Delicious. I added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis, and it turned out great!
Creamy White Chili#2#4#The best, while iit is hot' it is not a long lasting hoe. 
Creamy White Chili#3#7#This was my first attempt at a white chili and was a little disappointed. I added 8 oz of cream cheese instead of the sour cream and didn't like the resulting flavor. Should have followed the recipe. I will tinker with this some more, but all in all a very easy quick recipe. 
Creamy White Chili#4#3#We LOVE this recipe and fix it often! I even make it to take to people when they need a meal. A couple of things, I use unsalted chicken stock (the 32 oz box) instead of the broth and instead of the sour cream and heavy cream, I use a 12 oz container of Gandy's French Onion or Green Chili Dip. It just adds a little depth in flavor that we enjoy! 
Creamy White Chili#1#0#This is my all-time favorite white chili recipe. I make it as is except I will add a can of hominy and occasionally substitute pork for the chicken. Great with a spoonful of pico as well. So good!!
Creamy White Chili#3#0#I doubled the recipe. I also substituted the sour cream with cream cheese, added corn and bell peppers. Topped with sour cream, cilantro, shredded cheddar, and fritos! I am sooo very satisfied!
Creamy White Chili#1#5#Where's the cream cheese in the recipe? It says it's so good from the cream cheese. Was that a misprint? 
Creamy White Chili#3#1#i made this last night for dinner. It went together very fast and based on another reviewer, I added 8 ounces of cream cheese instead of the sour cream. I accidently added too much cayenne so I did offer sour cream at the table along with shredded cheese. Personally, I am not much of a fan of beans of any kind, but this chili was good. The only problem was it did not make enough for the hearty appetites for all the people at the table. Next time I make this I will double the recipe. But this is a keeper even by my standards.
Creamy White Chili#1#0#Delicious!! First time ever making a white chili and this one delivered in every way. Fantastic as is, didnt change a thing. Will be a favorite keeper for me!! Thanks for sharing!
Creamy White Chili#0#7#I changed this a little. I added carrots, potatoes and substituted coconut cream for the cream. I also left out the cumin. The creamy mix of the sour cream and cream made this soup delicious.
Creamy White Chili#1#2#I made this for movie night with a few friends. It got rave reviews and I thought it was yummy. On advice of previous reviews I used cream cheese instead of sour cream. I also popped a whole jalapeno in for the cooking process and fished it out and discarded when cooking was complete. Made it a day ahead of time. The one person in the group who doesn't like heat said it was just right. This is definitely going into my file of favorites! 
Creamy White Chili#1#0#I add creme cheese and more creme. I also roast my chicken breasts in the oven and then pull and dice the meat. I have won 3 chili cook-offs with my version! :)
Creamy White Chili#9#0#We have been making this for years now and its hands down our favorite chili recipe. One thing I love about it is that you can substitute low fat versions of the cream/sour cream and its still just as good. I've even used skim milk in place of the whipping cream with no problems! We always serve it with the Zucchini & Cheese Drop biscuits. To die for! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This recipe is awesome. Made it iver 10 times now. A big hit with the family!
Creamy White Chili#1#2#Is there cream cheese or no?
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very delicious and easy to make!!
Creamy White Chili#0#2#Im making this for dinner tonight, but I'm a little confused, you said it was sooo good because of the cream cheese, but there is no cream cheese in the recipe? Do i need it? 
Creamy White Chili#4#0#This recipe is amazing. I've been making it for years. Ignore the rude and ignorant comments from those who have yet to actually make it. If you want spicy feel free to add as much or as little of the cayenne pepper or jalapeños with or without seeds to your liking. That's the beauty of cooking at home. One tip I will give, if you want an extra creamy texture, add the creams in right away and let simmer until reduced.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Easy and tasty!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is the best white chili I've ever had. It is a hit with this family, old and young. I always think I might have some for a few days, but it never lasts that long. He never gets tired of it and neither do I!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#My absolute favorite chili recipe, it's so easy and delicious! I added half a can of corn and a little hot sauce to the recipe and it's amazing!!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Made this just as the recipie called for and it was delicious! Hubby loves it as well, will be making it again soon!
Creamy White Chili#1#0#Family favorite for many years. I've share this recipe with family
Creamy White Chili#0#0#So easy and flavorful, will be a new regular recipe in my house
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I have made this for several years. It is definitely a favorite in this house. I'll need to double it in the future. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#We've made this several times through the years, and it never disappoints! Also, recipe doubles well. 
Creamy White Chili#5#3#For those asking about the cream cheese, they changed the recipe online. It used to have cream cheese in place of the sour cream. I've made this recipe for years. I always look it up before I buy the ingredients to make sure I don't miss anything. I search by white chicken chili cream cheese to make sure I pull up this recipe. I was surprised to see sour cream now, especially because they specifically mention cream cheese in the description. I will continue to make it with the cream cheese because this is a family favorite and I don't want to change what's not broken. I make this close to the post recipe, but I do slow cook it on the stove with boneless skinless chicken breast and I also add cilantro when I mix in the cream and cream cheese. My picky boys love it!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is the BEST white chicken chili I have ever tasted. Everyone loved it and I am asked to make it all the time. I am confused, however, by the little note at the beginning of the recipe which reads Maybe it's the cream cheese . Am I missing something? I don't see cream cheese in the ingredients list anywhere. Sounds like it would be good, though. I highly recommend this chili! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I make this every year for Thanksgiving. I substitute turkey and turkey broth instead of chicken. Everyone loves it!!! If i miss a year making it, the family is complaining and wanting it.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very tasty and quite simple to make
Creamy White Chili#0#1#For those who are asking about cream cheese, it's not stated as cream cheese. The heavy whipping cream is what they are referring to when saying to add cream. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is a very easy recipe that delivers excellent results. Could not get over how good it was. Will make again.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Where is the cream cheese that's mentioned? It's not listed in the ingredients or directions. 
Creamy White Chili#0#1#I'm confused - in the description it says maybe it's the cream cheese . I can't find and cream cheese listed in the ingredients. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is a very good recipe. If needed it's easy to change it. I had to make some changes. I cannot have beans so I didn't put them in. I didn't have green chili so I added a can of tomatoes with green chillies. It came out great. I love recipes that can be changed to fit the person. Will be making this again. 
Creamy White Chili#1#2#Oh my gosh ..so good!, I substituted canelli beans because I like them better. I added just one can of green Chile's and NO heavy whipping cream (or no substitute for it). Like others suggested for thicker chili-like texture I added one tablespoon of flour to chicken
Creamy White Chili#2#0#Delicious, and easy to make. I followed the recipe with only tiny tweeks. I didnt have any cumin so i used a little chili powder instead. I also used just a little garlic, only because we are both sensitive to it, but if you are not, then go for it. Im sure it would add a lot. I didn't have sharp cheddar so i used 4 cheese Mecican blend shredded. Worked fine. But these were minor tweeks and I'm sure it is fabulous just as written too. Mine was plenty thick so i dont know why some people felt theirs was too thin. I did set out the 2 creams when i first started the dish so they wouldn't be so cold. When ready to add them i stirred a couple teaspoon of the hot chili into each to warm them up before adding so they wouldnt curdle. I will defimitely make this again. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe. 
Creamy White Chili#1#2#I gave this 4 stars because I followed this recipe to a T but omitting the sour cream and heavy whip. I mashed 1 can of beans to thicken the soul and added fresh garlic along with the powdered garlic. I also added more seasoning to my taste of each. I did add about 1 cup of the shredded cheese to the soup as well. I also added some frozen corn and cilantro to the soup as well as adding cilantro as a topping. This soup was amazing ??
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was hands down the most delicious white chili I have ever had! I did not add tortilla chips and only used 1 can of the green chili's and it was perfect!
Creamy White Chili#1#0#I didn't change a single thing!! Love it!! 
Creamy White Chili#0#1#I LOVELOVELOVE white chicken chili and play around with recipes for it often! This was Good! I did change/add quite a bit, but my favorite too to share is this: I saw a lot of people thickening with flour and gagged a little, lol! As a southern cook, my grandma taught me long ago to slowly sprinkle in instant mashed potatoe flakes to soups, etc! You don't taste the potato, it thickens Instantly and No Lumps!! Anyway... here's my other many, many tweaks: I used a cold store-bought chicken and sauteed a large, chopped Vidalia onion, half of a chopped red bell pepper, and added fresh, minced garlic to the veggies once they were softened. I didn't have green chiles, so I added two (Drained!!!) cans of Diced tomatoes with green chiles (one mild and one Mexican flavored, YUM!) Also, I had 2 cans of Canellini beans (white kidney beans) instead of great northern. As far as spice... I doubled or tripled the cumin- we like that flavor a LOT- and added a few handfuls of chopped cilantro. Also I seasoned the sauteing veg mix with the yellow Adobo and the Sazon Completa seasonings. Served this with chips, Monterey Jack cheese, guacamole and LOTS more fresh cilantro! So good but...sorry this was so long! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very good. I wonder if it once had cream cheese and taste of home changed the recipe. I prefer it with navy beans that are smaller. I also used canned chicken from Costco because that's what I had. I used fat free cream cheese along with the whipping cream, and then I stirred the cheddar cheese in at the end.
Creamy White Chili#0#4#The description says Maybe it's the cream cheese! Where is the cream cheese in the recipe ingredients? It says sour cream and whipping cream, NOT cream cheese. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was just excellent. I used half a pound of dry beans that I had cooked in my instant pot, as well as shredded chicken from bone-in thighs (also cooked in the pressure cooker). Didn't want to use heavy cream, so I just used a little milk and thickened with a couple of tablespoons of masa harina. I also shaved off a few calories with fat-free sour cream. Still very creamy and delicious. Probably could have added another can of green chiles, and may just do that next time I make a batch of this. 
Creamy White Chili#0#1#So good! I doubled the recipe. Mine came out very thick because I blended 1/2 the beans with the chicken broth, then added the rest of the beans. I may need to add a splash of water in each serving. I could go a little hotter next time. I got a large jalapeño so only put in one, minced mine. Maybe 2 next time. Used rotisserie chicken as a shortcut. Really delicious tho!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very good recipe. you do need to add a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch to it in order to thicken it up. I did omit the green chiles in order to control the heat. they can be added when served if you like it to be more spicy. Good for me without the chiles. I also love to eat regular chili served over rice. I did the same with this and it was great.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I found this recipe about a month ago and my boyfriend is obsessed. He made me bring it to Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit. He's having me make it again tonight for his birthday lol It really is the best chili ever. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Made this for the first time, last night. Read all the reviews first. However, followed the exact recipe, Results: Thinner than desired, but quickly fixed that with the great suggestion of 1 to 2 Tbls flour. Served with Tortilla chips. Great flavor, big hit with the husband! Will make again with rotisserie chicken and replace the whipping cream and sour cream with cream cheese. Unless a thinner chili is preferred, use the flour as other reviews suggest.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is an absolutely delicious recipe. I actually tripled the recipe and added about 1 cup grated parmesan cheese. It was not as thick as I would have liked it to be and was more like a soup than a chili but nonetheless, it was extremely flavorful and tasty!! I will definitely make this again!!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is a really good recipe. I made it for the first time last night -- need a white chili recipe to take to a gathering. I got a lot of compliments on it, and several requests for the recipe. I added minced garlic to it, and additional chicken broth. Next time, I'll probably triple the recipe -- as written, the yield is pretty small. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I LOVE this recipe. I use 1.5-2 pounds of shredded chicken instead of cubed. Perfect for dipping tortilla chips in as well.
Creamy White Chili#2#0#It was a little TOO CREAMY for me.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#BEST RECIPE EVER!! We all loved it, and I have some picky eaters! Thank you for sharing !! So yummy and easy to make. I didn't delete anything but added red pepper. Even without that change it would be amazing!! Thank you for sharing! A new family fav!! Yesss!!
Creamy White Chili#1#0#Excellent - I took the advice of a previous review and added 1 TBSP of flour to the chicken onion garlic mix. I used two Jalapenos instead of the canned chilies. I had to puree the beans only because my DH doesn't like the bean texture and I used butter beans. Lastly, I used 4 oz of cream cheese I had left in the fridge and a splash of heavy cream. EXCELLENT. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Greta recipe. Used a rotisserie chicken when I made it.
Creamy White Chili#1#0#Excellent recipe! Easy and quick. A keeper! Next time I may add some frozen corn. Joyce Moynihan, Volunteer Field Editor
Creamy White Chili#0#0#So I read the reviews before making this. I have never made white chili before but we tend to like our soups more like stew and our chili super thick. So after the chicken, onions and garlic (I used fresh garlic) were cooked I added two TBSP of flour and all the seasonings to the pot, stirred it in to coat the meat and let it cook for a couple minutes. Then I added the broth, chiles and three cans of beans. Finally I replaced the sour cream and whipping cream with cream cheese. SO Yummy!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Loved it!! Had a perfect little spice.
Creamy White Chili#2#0#I made this chili for our Super Bowl party. Everyone raved about how good it was and requested the recipe. The only thing I did differently was simmered it all day so the flavors could meld and the chicken would be super tender. It's not a real thick chili but that could easily be remedied by adding a little cornstarch, if that bothers you. Otherwise, this is a delicious recipe and I'm so glad I gave it a try. It's a keeper! :) 
Creamy White Chili#1#0#Yum! If you like really thick chili, I would suggest cutting back on the stock and sour cream/whipping cream a bit (and maybe the cayenne pepper too then) or adding a bit of cornstarch to thicken or pureeing a portion as other reviewers mentioned, but we thought it was really good as written! Just the right spiciness- I can't tolerate much heat but this leaves just a little'bite' in your mouth after eating it. (Or...if it's too thin- maybe you're not simmering it long enough with the lid off?) 
Creamy White Chili#0#2#This was terrible. I followed the recipe exactly. It tasted fine until I added the sour cream and whipping cream. Then, it turned into a thin, white, flavorless soup. Do not bother.
Creamy White Chili#1#0#My family loves the chili. I thought the beans might scare my little ones so I blended it in my immersion blender a bit. The second time I made it, I did not blend and everyone enjoyed it and requested seconds. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Besides being delicious, it's greatest strengths are it soooooo easy and quick. The only thing I did differently is used 1 can of garbanzo beans and 1 can of No. beans (didn't have 2 cans of Northerns). I, too, simmered it a bit longer to make it more chili-like. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Love this chili! Since I don't like things too spicy, I used less cayenne pepper and it was perfect.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I have made this Chil several times. I cook for Bingo, and everyone really likes it. At first they were afraid to try it, as they had never heard of it. My family also thinks it's great! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I pretty much stuck to the recipe, except I used leftover chicken. I did use one can of chilies and skip the cayenne pepper..so I guess I really didn't stick to the recipe. It was good either way! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very tasty and creamy.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Runner up in a chili cook-off. However I did use a whole rotisserie chicken. Was very thick, the way I wanted it based on the reviews below I did not want it to be thin. Crowd loved and I am almost certain I would have won if I hadn't run out. People came back for seconds before the last (5) people could judge it. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#My husband made this the other night for a crowd and it was delicious! He did not add the jalapeno because we didn't know if all the people could handle or enjoy that. Agree with the reviewers about it being thin, but you can add crackers at the table or just tweak with cornstarch, sour cream, or cream cheese. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Really good recipe! However, after adding the sour cream and heavy cream it did get soupy. After adding the creams I ended up putting it back on low heat to warm it back up and then added a teaspoon or so of corn starch to thicken it up. Worked perfectly
Creamy White Chili#0#1#So so recipe. It's more like a soup than a hearty chili. The recipe calls for WAY too much chicken stock. Half that amount would have been more than enough. The chili never thickens no matter how long you cook it. Again, this should be called soup not chili. Way better chili recipes out there. Won't make again. 
Creamy White Chili#1#0#This is a wonderfully tasty chili. I got tired of tomato sauce, so this was a nice change. The first time I made this I tripled it for a family gathering and everyone loved it; I only put in half the chili amount though. It did get a bit soupy, but I just let it simmer longer.
Creamy White Chili#0#1#@Steve - Cannellini beans are not the same as great northern beans. Great Northern are smaller and have a different texture.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is great on a chilly, overcast day. My brother asked for this recipe.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#@Christine Cannellini beans ARE great northern beans. duh
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was very easy and very good! I'm not sure that it yields 7 servings if served as a main course (likely closer to 4). Certainly, pre-cooked chicken (or turkey) could be used for even further ease, making it a great recipe for leftovers. I used cannellini beans and part of me thought they weren't hearty enough. I almost wanted to replace the beans with potato...but then I guess it wouldn't be chili! Either way, I will certainly make it again! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I was looking for a chili with a white sauce because the tomato sauce gives me heartburn. So does the white but not as bad, when I found this and made it for the first time. Now my family can't get enough of it!! It's not difficult to make at all! And heartburn, yeah probably. BUT WHO CARES THIS STUFF IS THE BOMB!! Thanks for the recipe, it's a hit and a change from the regular hamburger and red sauce. It's my new chili go to!! 
Creamy White Chili#1#0#Delicious !! I loved it because it skips the tomatoes which I'm tired of lately every quick dish is buried in tomato sauce.Had to improvise, only had 1 can of chilies, added a tsp of chipotle to make up for it.1 half breast wasn't a pound 2 was a little over. The extra bit of meat was a bonus.Don't always have heavy cream on hand, had to leave it out but used a bit of whole milk.Served it with crispy garlic Texas Toast.This is worth expanding for a crowd. It's a nice change from red chili that seems to be the rage. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#An extraordinary recipe. We all loved this chili! One of the better white chili recipes I've tried. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Make this! You'll be happy you did. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I created an account simply to post this review. That's how good this chili is! I made it as described, and it was seriously amazing! I personally wouldn't change a thing. I plan on making it again this weekend for out of town family that'll be staying with us. Don't hesitate to make this! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was just OK. It wasn't bad but I thought it was missing something (corn? cilantro? not sure what). I gave it 4 stars because of the ease of the recipe. Not sure how this recipe wins cook-off's though... 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I used canned chicken - even faster and easier. A new family favorite!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Delicious! This is definitely one of our favorites!
Creamy White Chili#1#0#I won yet another chili cook-off with this recipe last weekend. It's a keeper for sure!!! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#My husband is a chili lover. He was however, disappointed when I said we were having white chicken chili. I left out the whipping cream and the recipe was fine as is. When he ate it he was amazed and absolutely loved it. This recipe is a keeper! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is a great recipe as written; family loved it. I want to make this without the beans as my husband is on a special diet that allows basically no fiber. I am thinking of using pork in place of chicken and white potatoes in place of beans. Wondering if anyone has changed it around like this? As long as the flavor is there I would think this would work. Any suggestions are appreciated!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Had to try this when I saw how many reviews it had! I left out the whipping cream. It turned out really great!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Wow, this is a winner! Very tasty, with just the right amount of heat. After cooking the chicken and onions on the stove, I put everything in my Crock Pot for 4 hours on Low. I was using fat-free sour cream, so I mixed that with 2 tbsp. of cornstarch to keep it from separating. And I didn't have any heavy cream, so I left that out, but it was plenty creamy without it. I wouldn't change anything else; we really loved this recipe. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I love it, everyone in my home loves it, and I have been asked for the recipe many times. I have to triple the recipe for my family. It is very easy to make.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I've made this recipe several times for my family. We leave out the chicken for vegetarian style and serve it over baked potatoes, rice, or quinoa. They love it every time! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This a an awesome recipe... I shredded my chicken and it was even better the second day....Whole family and staff loved it... Would not change a thing....
Creamy White Chili#0#0#good one
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Good recipe. But on day 2 you need to serve the rest or freeze it. Chicken only tastes good for max of 2 days
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Easy to prepare, great alternative to standard chili receipt! I add sour cream later on once it is served, otherwise fantastic receipt!
Creamy White Chili#1#0#This is a wonderfully rich and creamy chili that is quite different from other white chili recipes I've tasted. It has been a hit every time I've made it. I made two changes to the original recipe based on the reviews I read here. I add a third can of northern beans and mash them to add thickness to the chili. Also, instead of cooking a pound of boneless chicken breasts, I use the breast meat from a store-bought rotisserie chicken (Costco, in my case). The breast meat is already seasoned, so no need for the garlic powder and canola oil. I dice up the meat into 1/4 cubes - a little smaller than the original recipe. One of the easiest chilis I've ever made and so delicious! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I loved this recipe! I added some red pepper flakes, and probably would add a little more next time. It does come out a little soupy, so I may try smashing some of the beans next time or using a little less broth. The sour cream and heavy cream added to the wonderful flavor, I served over brown rice which was a fantastic pair.
Creamy White Chili#0#1#I have made this twice now for soup suppers at church and everyone loves it! The only thing that I found was that the sour cream doesn't want to mix in without being clumpy so next time I'll whisk the sour cream and whipping cream together first to help loosen up the sour cream. Hopefully it will mix in more smoothly. GREAT RECIPE! 
Creamy White Chili#1#0#So yummy! I like to use fresh garlic in place of garlic powder ( 4 cloves). I also use 3-4 cups chicken broth, one can chilies, and one can Rotel to this recipe.
Creamy White Chili#1#0#This was really good! Easy to make and great on a chilly night. Loved the flavor. Thanks for sharing I will definitely make again.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Entered this chili in a chili cook-off contest and won! Everyone loved it. Made the recipe exactly as written. I did smash one can of the beans to help thicken it up a bit.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I, too, loved this chili. Made a few minor changes per reviewers- additional can of beans, a little less sour cream and heavy cream. Since it does turn out a bit soupy I serve it over rice or a baked or mashed potato. Everyone who tries it, loves it.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is absolutely the best chicken chili. I have made it for several different friends and everyone just loves it. I make it EXACTLY as the recipe states.......delicious!!!!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I have been making this chili for several years now. I make it exactly as written. I sometimes have a little more chicken than one pound as it's hard to get a package of chicken breast that is 1 lb. I just usually use 3 breasts so sometimes it's a little more. When making for company I have added one more can of beans. It is delicious! My advice to someone making it for the first time is make it exactly as written and then make any adjustments you want for next time. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is a favorite in our home, especially on cold days! During winter we have it regularly. It has wonderful flavor, i use all ingredients except I add a little bit of white chicken chili seasoning to it and put it in crock pot to cook. At last add sour cream and whipping cream. Enjoy!
Creamy White Chili#0#1#I'm always amazed how people rate a recipe 5* and then state how they changed the recipe -- significantly. So, after reading all the comments, I've read I'm not sure whether to even try the recipe. Why people can't just do a recipe without changing it is beyond me. How do they know what the real recipe is like to even begin to rate it? 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I have made this recipe several times and I love it! The first time I used chicken breast. Second time I used ground chicken. The ground chicken definitely made it feel more like chili. But I like them both. The changes I made along the way: omit one can of green chilies, add one can of beans which I then use to mash against the pot with a spoon (to get a thicker consistency more like chili), added some dried cilantro and a little more seasoning to taste to compensate for the extra beans. Yummy! Add some cornbread and you're done! Quick and easy! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#The flavor of this chili is excellent. I would mention that it could have been a bit thicker, not so runny. And I used chicken thigh meat instead which made the bites of meat super tender.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I have made this chili recipe several times and it never fails to impress. My only change is omitting the cayenne pepper. Great recipe.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#??
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I used one less can of green chilies, Glory seasoned northern beans, and omitted the salt. Very good, the Glory brand beans added much needed flavor. Frittos on top to add a little crunch and salt. Yummy!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#We LOVE this chili recipe! I always have to double it, so we can have leftovers
Creamy White Chili#0#0#If you puree (I use my hand blender) one can of the beans it becomes the thickener with no need for flour
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Great recipe 2nd time making it. However it comes out like a soup. I added wondra flour to achieve a thicker chili consistency, Love it!!! this one is in my recipe collection, Thank you!!!! I did make this recipe again on Nov. 11, 2016 even when I added a extra can of beans and mashed them prior to adding, I still needed to thicken with flour for more of a chili consistency however still an awesome recipe!!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is a wonderful recipe and simple to make! All the ingredients blend well together and it is a great alternative to regular chili. It is also super tasty the next day and reheats well. Thanks!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This had very little flavor & too many green chilies.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I made this in the crock pot! changes i made: two frozen chicken breasts in crock pot...sauteed onion and minced garlic, doubled the broth and never added the heavy cream or sour cream...cooked on low for 8 hours. it turned out great!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Y family loved this!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very Good!!! Cooked my own beans and used jalape?o ground pepper instead of cayenne pepper. Delicious!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Can you make this without the beans?
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This White Chilli was Really good just seasoned very well! I was low on Great White bean so Made with Half Black eyed peas and Half Great white from Dried Beans. Cook the Beans first... Will be making this again. Yummy wow
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Best White Chili Recipe in Town, I've been making this for 20 or so years. I do not take it anywhere where I don't get asked for the recipe. Also, if you do like it a little spicier you can buy hot chopped green chilies (NOT jalapenos) instead of the regular mild ones. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very good! Will make again. I added more beans, just my personal preference.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#We really liked this recipe and the only change I made was adding 3rd can of beans (after reading the other reviews). Next time I make this chili I will decrease the amount of sour cream, and I will keep the pan on the stove after adding the sour cream & heavy whipping cream - otherwise it cools the dish to lukewarm. This is a unique and flavorful meal.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Good stuff!!! THINGS I DID DIFFERENTLY: I sauteed 1 fresh garlic clove and one finely chopped jalapeno, upped more spices, added a dash of cinnamon and shredded a pre-roasted chicken to save time. I also added more cayenne pepper because it just wasn't spicy enough for me. I also mashed up one can of the beans to help thicken it a bit. And I used garlic salt instead of reg. salt. I added bacon crumbles and sharp cheddar. This made it super flavorful and CLEARLY not healthy. At all. But so good. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Terrific! Used this for a dinner party, and everyone walked away with the recipe. Didn't change anything about the recipe. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This recipe is amazing. I will definitely be making again. :)
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was delicious. The only changes I made was reducing the amount of sour cream and adding an extra can of northern beans.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I made this last night and it was amazing! Both my husband and I loved it. I did not have sour cream on hand so I just added extra heavy cream and it was great. This will now be in my fall/winter go to meals. It really was a quick meal prep too. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#wonderful!!!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I haven't tried this recipe but feel I can give it a five star rating because I have a very similar recipe - which everyone enjoys. The only difference is that I use 2 TBSP of fresh cilantro in place of the oregano - and 1 1/2 cups of shredded Monterey Jack in place of the whipping cream - and cut the sour cream to 1/2 cup. I also cut back the pepper and cayenne pepper because my family doesn't like foods too hot ... 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I made this chili for the first time last year at a chili cookoff at work. We were doing a fundraiser for the North Texas Food Bank. I didn't win, but I had SEVERAL people ask for the recipe. They loved it!!! It was devoured in minutes.Well, I made it again last night and entered it in the chili cookoff again today. Well.........There were 18 entries and I won 3rd place. Again. had many tell me how they loved it and asked for the recipe.I love this chili but I do have one secret that I cannot share!!! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I've made this chili several times. Everyone who has tried it absolutely loves it. It's a huge winner for me. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Great flavor and texture! though i must agree with some of the other reviews, its closer to a chowder than a chili. I added 1 cup of mozzerella cheese when i added the cream and let it simmer about 10min. more. It thickened it and rounded out all the flavors. Great dish. I'll be making it again. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Fantastic taste! It is more like a soup than a chili. I didn't read the directions carefully & added the sour cream & heavy cream at the same time as everything else - still turned out perfect! The only changes I made was I used leftover roasted chicken & fresh green pepper instead of canned. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Made just as recipe read except I only had 1% milk. All it needed was a pan of cornbread. Delicious!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This chili was very flavorful and easy to make...freezes well!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is the best white chili. I double the recipe so we can enjoy leftovers. Thank you for a real keeper.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#It really hit the spot !
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I love this and so did my family. !!!!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This chili is off the charts good! Everyone in my family raved about it. I did use fresh minced garlic and added more chicken and beans for a bigger crowd. This is definitely going in my favorite recipes box.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is a great recipe, I did only put half the sour cream in and added no cream. Turned out sooo yummy!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is a great recipe, I did only put half the sour cream in and added no cream. Turned out sooo yummy!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I used half & half instead of whipping cream. Everyone enjoyed it and had seconds.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was SO GOOD!!! Super easy to make. Only thing I did different was I added fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Got good reviews but I wanted a little something more flavorwise. I will tweak next time. Maybe it needs some bacon?
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was very good, but I will add an extra can of beans next time.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Really good and quick! I think sweet corn would be good in it too, firstof6ps!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I made it exactly as indicated and it was fantastic. I wanted to lick the bowl. This recipe is a keeper!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#my whole family enjoyed this decadent chili, that is more like a soup. so easy to make.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Tasted great. Next time I may add sweet corn
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Wonderful recipe! LOVED your response to''Sunshinebakerpa'' mdredmond!!! Made my day..thanks! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Sunshinebakerpa said: I made it without the green chilies, but found it was missing something. I used a little less sour cream and heavy cream like the others had suggested to make it thicker. So you made your own chili recipe, omitted chilis and thought it was missing something. Then you rated this recipe 3/5. I hope you aren't a registered voter. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#For me, a published recipe is a guideline rather than an absolute. I adjusted this recipe slightly, based on the ingredients I had on hand. I added 1/2 t. poultry seasoning (in place of Oregano). Used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I only had one can of chopped green chilies, so added a cup of chopped red, yellow and orange bell pepper. We like heat, so I used 1T of cayenne, and we added sliced jalape?o peppers and shredded cheese on top, forgoing the sour cream. I used 2 c. of whole milk instead of heavy whipping cream, and 2 T corn starch as a thickener. There are so many ways to make white chili, that as long as you keep it white and use the right amount of herbs and seasoning, based on the preferences of those you are feeding, you've got a hit every time. Our side was a handful of gluten free corn chips, but sweet cornbread would be perfect too. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Absolutely Delicious! Reading all the reviews, I have to say Ditto. Excellent, fantastic, wonderful, wouldn't change a thing. I did chop my chicken that was par-cooked instead of cubing it, however, and cooked in Crock Pot - 45 minutes on High, then about 3 hours on Low. My 11-year-old is picky and didn't seem thrilled about white chili. He Now says it's the best thing in the world and he could eat it every night. It went great with tortilla chips, too! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I use a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket. I make it without the green chilies so to give it more flavor, I add concentrated chicken broth. I use a little less sour cream and heavy cream like the others had suggested to make it thicker. It freezes well.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#We've made this twice in the last two weeks. Yummy!! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Have made this several times, it's a big hit in our house!! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Would make again. used approx 1/2 cup sour cream and a little under 1/2 cup for the whipping cream to make it thicker. Simmering helps the liquid reduce. Made corn bread to go with it. YUM!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#So good! My husband and I really liked it! Better than my other white chili recipe!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was delicious! Everyone in the family enjoyed it! Definitely a keeper!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This chili was amazing my family loved it. I definitely recommend trying it.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is now my chili recipe. It's a total knockout! I use 1 can of northern beans, 1 can of garbanzo beans, and 1 can of sweet white corn. My friends and family BEG for it. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I've been looking for a great chicken chili recipe. This one doesn't quite fit the bill for my family, although it's good. It's just missing that something special. Maybe cilantro would make the difference. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Made this and everyone loved it. I didn't have the green chilies so I used a few red pepper flakes. Will definitely make this again. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very good! I didn't have any of the spices but had a pack of white chicken chili seasoning and used it. I also left out the green chilies since I have young children. Because we have 6 people in our family I added 2 more cans of beans and more broth to stretch it further. Still very good. Gonna add this to my regular winter recipes 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Great flavor but not as thick as I would have like it. But even my fussy eaters (who were not looking forward to it) liked it!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#GOOD STUFF! I made it for dinner this weekend. My girlfriend and I loved it! I substituted about 12 oz of recently purchased Dynamite roasted chilies for the 8 oz of canned green chilies. We both like our chili with a tad of WHANG to it. The two of us finished off the leftovers the next day for lunch. I will definitely be making this again!! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Made this hearty chili tonight for dinner and my family really loved it! It has a nice combination of flavors and is really delicious. I will be adding Creamy White Chili to my recipe book!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#EXCELLENT IS ALL I CAN SAY WITH CORNBREAD MUFFINS!!! YUM YUM ;)
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I love anything with green chilies in it and this was great. I could have eaten the entire pot it was so good. Our weather became winter overnight, 28 below the other night, and this was hearty, tasty, and super easy to make, the perfect cold weather recipe. I had to make a few adjustments because I live in the country and didn't want to navigate the icy roads just to get the few ingredients I was lacking. I looked up substitutions for heavy cream and sour cream on the internet and I am certain it was close. I used fresh garlic and added red pepper flakes because I love them and add them to whatever I can get away with. I would add them to my coffee if it would work. Thank you Laura for this great recipe, I am debating whether to make another batch tomorrow. I usually share what I cook with family that lives close by but I want to hoard this it is so good. I don't review many recipes but this one was worth searching for my login info to leave my comment. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Excellent flavor, delicious, and quick. This one is a keeper!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was simple to make but had a flavor that will make your family think you have worked all day preparing it. Didn't change a thing. Next time I will try the advice to serve with cornbread. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Every one enjoyed this meal. The heat was perfect for me. I added cheddar cheese to the top and had some tortilla chips with that. Others in my household also added jalapenos and hot sauce as they like things extra hot I guess! everyone loved it and It was so fast and easy to make.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Wonderfully delicious on this cold winters day!!! I'm an intermediate level cook. I get excited about finding and trying new recipes. And today I'm totally excited! This is just an easy recipe with A LOT of taste! I followed the recipe exactly and won't change a thing when I make this again. And again. And again. Thank you for the recipe! :-) Happy Eating Everyone :-) 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very good. The only thing I would do differently would be to add a 3rd can of beans.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Made this recipe exactly as stated except I doubled it. Glad I did because it was gone! Delicious and quick!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I too have been making this chili since I first received my Taste of Home magazines as a yearly gift from my Mom years ago. Very easy and very tasty! Now the weather is here for this recipe to be used alot! We are steering away from red meat, so this is a winner!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I have been making this for years, it is a huge hit. I omitted the whipping cream and add canned milk thickened with a little corn strarch. I also omit the cayenne pepper, it was just to spicy with it.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I've been making this for years. It is the absolute best chili and easy to make. It's a hit whenever I serve it. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I found this recipe a couple of years ago. It is one of the most requested recipes by my family in the fall and winter.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I've been making this same recipe for years, and it is always a hit! I add a can of white sweet corn to it and serve with cornbread. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I've made this recipe for years since it was first published. The first time I made it, I followed the directions exactly and found it a little too spicy with the green chilies. The next time and each subsequent time, I've left out them out and to my family, it's the perfect white chili. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#These dish was terrific! It was a little spicy for me but my husband said it was just right. Because of some of the reviews, the only thing I changed was cutting the whipping cream in half and only used 6 ounces of sour cream. Definitely will be one recipe kept in my folder.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Liked the flavor and the touch of heat was good.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#The flavor here is a nice mild heat tempered by the sour cream and heavy cream. If you do not like heat, omit the cayenne pepper. I made a savory cornbread to go with this (sans sugar), added cheese, garlic powder and onion powder. In place of buttermilk, I used powdered milk and a corn meal/flour premixed, and added a cup of cheese. Nice for a rainy autumn day. Enjoy!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I added a chopped jalapeno (Texans love their heat), fresh garlic and served with corn bread and had grated cheese and cilantro as toppers to add a little Tex-Mex to it. Very good.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Too spicy for my taste. I should have left out the cayenne pepper. Otherwise really good flavor!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Wow! I thought it would be good, but this is FABULOUS!! I served it with Cheez-It crackers instead of saltines and it was a hit! This is a keeper!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This recipe is also delicious when made in the crock pot!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#my husband's favorite soup ever! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Amazing!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is a crowd winner every time.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#My husband and I loved this chili. Excellent recipe. Lots of flavor.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#We love this recipe, any one I make this for loves it and asks for it. I would give it 5 stars but for one thing. As delicious as it is, I think it is much improved with the addition of some cilantro.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I absolutely love this recipe, and have made it many times since it made its first appearance in Taste of Home magazine back in 2001. The only negative is that it is a bit rich, so it should probably be a once-in-awhile thing!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is absolutely delicious - I would give it a 50 star rating if I could. We made it exactly the way the recipe states, we figured if we liked it and we were going to make it again we would make a change then. However it is PERFECT exactly the way it is, we love it!!! I made a batch yesterday (already gone) so I'm making another batch today. Anyone who said they didn't like it (which is maybe one or two) must have used different brands or something than what we did because this is seriously good.....I can't wait to have more today!!! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I've had white chili before, but thought a creamy-style would be a nice twist. This was so delicious! My husband kept raving about it. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Really really good!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Delicious
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I LOVE this recipe! I won most original in a chili cookoff with this. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I have never tried a white chili before but this was delicious and easy to prepare! This will be part of my regular dinner rotation.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#So easy to make and so delicious!! We loved this recipe and will be making it again!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Fabulous recipe. The best White Chili I have had
Creamy White Chili#0#0#A huge favorite in our house! Just make sure you use good northern beans. I know that I've gotten some canned northern beans that are mushy to begin with. That doesn't make for a good chili. 
Creamy White Chili#1#0#This recipe is amazing! I used ground chicken and ground Italian sausage (about half and half), and followed the recipe exactly for everything else. Cooking the sausage and chicken together adds LOTS of flavor. It's turnout delicious twice now. I highly recommend! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This soup is good and easy to make. I did make a few changes--I used leftover chicken, 3 cans beans, a little extra water to simmer in, and I left out the cream because I didn't want it any thinner. I would use milk to thin if needed. It was yummy and easy. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This recipe tastes so good. I use garlic cloves instead of the powder, and skip cayenne. I already take cayenne caps each day. Loved it!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#My husband and I loved it and I would make it again for us, but the kids did not care for it. Too many beans for their taste. I followed another reviewers suggestion to cook it in the crock-pot on low and stirred in the sour cream and cream about 30 minutes before serving.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was super easy and delicious! Will definitely be making again.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Awesome white chili. My husband was skeptical since chili is one of his favorite foods. He loved it! It is now a favorite in our house.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is my favorite white chili recipe. I've made it several times. We found it to be a little hot for our taste, so I now leave out the cayenne pepper. Sometimes I substitute a 13 oz can of chicken instead of the fresh chicken breast and cook it in a crockpot on low for 3 or 4 hours, then stir in the sour cream and cream just before serving. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is a new favorite in my house. It's so quick and easy, but tastes like it took all day. I modified the recipe a bit - I bake, then shred the chicken. I also leave out the onions (I hate the texture, but like the taste so I use onion powder). I also hate the texture of green chiles, so I puree them in the food processor. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Awesome, enjoyed every bite. Will definitely make again. Next time I would make a little spicier .
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This recipe is a keeper, it has a very nice flavor. Will make it again.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#wanted some chili on this very cold winter's day and this really hit the spot. I used half lb of chicken breast and half lb of chicken Italian sausage because that is what I had on hand. It is fabulous. The aroma got my sleepyhead son out of bed looking for food. Great with cornbread on the side. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Love this chili. I'm not a fan of red chili, so this is perfect. I've been asked to share this recipe many times over, and it's always a big hit. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I tried this for dinner last night. It was very good - not too spicy. I did not have whipping cream in the house, so I served it without that. In my opinion, the sour cream really mellows and compliments the spices used. Hubs is not a spicy food lover, but he cleaned his bowl and asked for more! Would definitely recommend this recipe. Thanks for sharing, Laura!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Love, love, love this recipe. I double the broth for a soupier texture. I have also served it without the sour cream and whipping cream some time - I just called in a chicken green chili soup - you can even add potatoes and call it a stew. As a person that grew up in NM, it is a taste of home. Love, love, love it.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was very good. I forgot to put the sour cream and whipping cream in stiil good
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Family loves it. Easy and tasty.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I've taken this to potlucks and always get rave reviews on it and requests for the recipe. I love it! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Wow, what great flavor and easy to make. I cut back on the sour and heavy cream to reduce some of the calories and it was still great tasting.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was very good. I will make it again.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was excellent and a hit with my family! I will definitely make this again!!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was excellent and my family loved it! It's a keeper!! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was excellent! And it was a hit with the family!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was excellent and a hit with the family! This one is a keeper!!!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#love it on a cold night with rolls
Creamy White Chili#0#0#So good!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Wonderful:)
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Absolutely delicious! Everyone loved it and had perfect flavoring! Making it again very soon.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Absolutely delicious! Everyone loved it and will definitely be making it again.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Most of my family loved this. I did make a few minor changes to adapt to my daughter's taste while keeping the essence and taste of the recipe in tact.I took a note from purplepentacle using fresh garlic along with toasting and grinding my own cumin seeds.My daughters do not like green chilies so I reduced it to one can. They also love the taste but not the texture of onions; because of this after sauteing the onion and garlic I pureed them along with the green chilies.We love cilantro and use it in most of my soups, so I doubled the amount used.I added 1/4 cup of rice. My daughter doesn't like the consistency of chili, so because of this and the addition of the rice, I used 48 ounces of broth; this gave it a chowder consistency.To make it healthier I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and plain Greek yogurt rather than sour cream.I was in a hurry so I used a store bought roasted chicken. I added a splash of lemon juice to cut the greasiness of the chicken.I served it in small bread bowls. It was very stick to your ribs and is now a favorite. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was a big hit. I made a few minor changes to fit my families taste without changing the essence of the recipe. First of all my daughters do not care for green chilies, so I used only one can. I also pureed the green chilies along with the sauteed onions and garlic. My daughters love the flavor of onions but not the texture. Secondly we adore the flavor of cilantro, I use it as a flavor enhancer in the majority of soups; so in this case I doubled the amount of cilantro. Additionally I added a quarter cup of rice. My oldest doesn't like chili texture so because of this and the addition of the rice I used a 48 ounce box of broth. This gave it a chowder consistency that my daughter loved. I used precooked roasted chicken so I added a light splash of lemon juice to cut the greasiness . Lastly to make it healthier I swapped evaporated milk for the heavy cream and plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. All of the flavors of the original recipe is there and with the minor changes it has become a favorite of my oldest daughter. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I've been looking for this recipe for 3 years and am SO glad to have found it. It is delicious ! My friends loved it as much as I did. This one will be made again and again. Love it. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Perfectly delicious, confirmed by my husband requesting leftovers for two more subsequent meals! Added 3/4 cup kernel corn, sprinkled cheese on top, garnished with chopped tomato, and a few dollops of guacamole -- beautiful and delicious!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I have made this several times and always love the creamy chili on a cold day! I replaced the whipping cream with canned evaporated milk. (skim is what I like- caloriewise) l also add 1 can creamed corn, and stir in monterey jack cheese. with great results! I top with light sour cream, and chopped green onions. Serve with your favorite corn chips. My family requests it all the time.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#One of the best chili I've ever had!!!!!!! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Not sure what all the 5 star reviews are about. I was disappointed. My husband liked this because it was spicy. My kids and I did not. I had to make a second dinner for them after they begged not to eat it. It will give you lots of gas too!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#We like this recipe as it's very tasty and different. I added diced celery, and bell pepper since I was out of the green chili's, and added an extra can of beans. My husband really liked it. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Absolutely the BEST chili we've ever had!! I used rotisserie chicken which I added at the last minute, and only used one 4oz can of green chiles. Oh my, DELICIOUS!! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is wonderful. Really quite easy to make and tastes delicious. I love it.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#my hubby absolutely loves this! he requests it more than beef chili. my 6 yr old will eat this like its going out of style. never any leftovers in our house.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#We love soups and this one is terrific. Just enough bite to be interesting! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I Have made this recipe a number of times. It is so easy to make and so delicious. I have made it for family and friends. It is awesome!!!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Thick and rich. Really enjoyed as an alternative to a traditional chili
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very good recipe.easy to make.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was wonderful! I served it up with some cajun bread and everyone loved it!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I have never made white chili before and I was sceptical to try this! I am so glad I did! My entire family loved this! I cooked my chicken lightly in my skillet with onion/garlic, but then instead of cooking it all on the stove, I put it over into my crockpot with all of the other ingredients. I started this in the morning on high and it was ready in 4 hours. (I chose this method because I am a busy mom and I like to start my meals in the morning and then have all the prep work done for me) I served this up with some cajun bread and we had a wonderful lunch! Thank you for another wonderful recipe, Taste of Home! Will be making this one again!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Extremely tasty! Easy to make. Will make again
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I made this with low calorie /fat free substitutes and it was great! Whole family enjoyed. Family of 4 ate all of it. Would make a side salad to go with it next time.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#My family loves this recipe. I altered it and added corn starch to make it a bit thicker. Plus, we use crushed tortilla chips on top as a garnish.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#will do this again--except next time I will use more beans. very tasty. just a trifle thin for us. mushrooms sound like a good idea too.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#So delicious! The only thing I changed, was I added a can of corn and I only used 1 can of green chilies.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very good, simple & quick white chili recipe. I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#My husband and I love this. Instead of cayenne and green chilis, I use a can of Rotel. It comes out great.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I made it for our staff lunch. It was really good. Thanks for the recipe.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This one was a hit with all the family. I used evaporated milk, instead of heavy cream and didn't add sour cream during cooking. Everyone added their own sour cream at the table. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is my first time to make a white chili. This is wonderful. It is so easy to make. I used an already roasted chicken from the deli and also added a can of mushrooms. Everything else I kept the same.I made some Honey Beer Bread to go with it.. What and awesome dinner.. The wine was good too.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was definitely a hit. I didn't use the Heavy cream at all, I only used the sour cream, and I added a can of mushrooms. Also, I have to wonder if it is coming out different for people that live in different places. I live in Southern New Mexico, we are in the desert and elevated like 3500 ft. It wasn't thin for me, nice and creamy and DE-LISH!! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#We were disappointed after all of the great reviews for this recipe. The only changes made were to add 1 tsp minced garlic and use 33% less sodium chicken broth. This was just okay for us. Perhaps we prefer beef chili instead!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#There's another White Chicken Chili from Taste of Home that I usually make that is done in the crockpot and starts with a jar of alfredo sauce. I decided to make this one because I wanted something that I could make quickly that didn't have to cook all day. This tasted similar and we really liked it because it was quick. I think I will double next time for more leftovers. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#A great change! Really good.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very Very good and easy to make!!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very good. Followed the recipe except didn't add the cayenne which would have helped. Will next time. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#First time I've made a white chili. We loved it. I used only one can of chilies and it was plenty of heat for us. Next time I may add another can of beans, but it is thick enough with the just the two. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is great anyway but after making it at least 20 times now i have some suggestions. Add an extra can of great N. beans and thicken the soup with some cornstarch or flour. Use Tillamook brand sour cream there is a HUGE difference. Iv'e tried both. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This recipe is amazing!!!! I wanted a unique chili to enter in my first contest and I wont third place. The top three chilis were very close in points and everyone was raving about this chili! I didnt hear ONE person complain about it. I doubled it because of entering it into a cook-off and I also added two jalepeno's to give it a little bit of spice. A+++ for this recipe!!! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#made just as it said to was great husband even asked about it and said it was very good.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#made just as it said to was great husband even asked about it
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This soup was a hit! It was easy and quick to bring together. The only thing I did different was add a fresh jalepeneo to the canned chillies. I think it could benefit from some more veggies, like corn. The other thing I noted was that to me, it seemed salty. I think next time I make it, I will cut back on the salt added and add some corn.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This Chili was a hit with adults and kids. Garnished with some grated mexican cheese, and it made it cheesy licious. The only thing I thought it lacked was some veggies...I thought maybe some frozen corn could be added...next time, I will try that.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Was not to impressed with this recipe.All I could taste was the cream.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very simple to make with great taste! Very nice change. I made this in the crock-pot all day on low. Amazing! Plan to make this for dinner with friends after Christmas serice. Cant wait!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This recipe is very simple and tastes great. I add a can of Rotel and use one can of chilies. Delicious!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#My fiance and I made this for the first time tonight... and it was AMAZING! It was a delicious balance of cream and spice. We would recommend this to anyone!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I made a double batch of this but put in only half the chilies since we don't like spicy. I also used a bulb of fresh garlic! Absolutely delicious! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This recipe is really good! My picky brothers devoured it.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This chili is great. The only changes I made: I doubled the recipe, used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 half & half and added 2 extra cans of green chilis. My family really liked it but my son (who doesn't like sour cream) thought the sour cream flavor was too strong so next time I will cut the sour cream in half. This recipe is definitely a keeper. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very nice flavor. The only problem I had was with the consistancy - it was more like soup than chili.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was so good and easy. The only changes I made were to use a whole roasted chicken cut up and instead of whipping cream I used fat free half and half. It turned out great.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Reading all the 5 star reviews I thought this would be a slam dunk. It was good but disappointing. Not what I expected. I have another similar recipe that's the keeper so I will stick with that one. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very tasty. I made the mistake however, in that I put too much broth in and it turned more into a soup then chili. But it was still good and I will definitely try this again.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I cut the recipe in half. I didn't have fresh chicken on hand, so drained a can of chicken. Yummy! Next time I'll make the whoe recipe. NO Leftovers! :( 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Served this to a friend just last night. Every time I make it, people rave about it.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is the most wonderful white chili. I have made it over and over. It is my families favorite. I make it with the spiciness or without.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very good, I mashed up an extra can of beans to thicken. A keeper.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very good and very easy.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Made a double batch for a work luncheon. They ate the whole thing! Even though there were 9 soups, and it made a large crock pot full! I mixed the everything together, including the cream and sour cream before cooking in the crock pot on high for 4 hours. It turned out wonderful. I also only added 3 cans green chiles (1 1/2 the recipe instead of double) just so it wouldn't be too hot. Next time I will add all 4 cans because although it had a kick, it wasn't as much as I like. I also did as others have recommended and used instant potato flakes to make it creamier. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for submitting it! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Terrific and easy!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Doubled this recipe for a dinner at work. Raves....
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This recipe won my chili cookoff at work today =D I added 1 pound of ground chicken, spiced it up a little more, and used potato flakes to thicken it up a little and it was PERFECT. Glad to see this is a contest winner on the site, as it was in my office as well!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Wow! My family loved this even my picky eaters. My husband said it's so good it could win a contest. I even had to substitute a couple items and it still turned out incredible!. Thank you for the 5 star recipes. Renae 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Great recipe! So easy to make and so full of flavor. This recipe is a keeper.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is one of my husband's favorites, and I make it on a regular basis during the colder months (which is almost all of them here in Oregon!) I usually reduce the jalapenos and pepper for my daughter and I who can't handle a lot of spices. We top it with onions and shredded cheese and serve with cornbread. Yum! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#My family loved this chili!! Even my two picky boys ate it up. My husband was vocally disappointed when the last of the leftovers was gone and he has never done that before over leftovers of anything! I will be making this again often.
Creamy White Chili#0#1#Absolutely horrible. I'm a great cook and this turned out terrible. I even added things to help it and it was terrible! I'm entering a chili contest tomorrow and this will definitely notgo in. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Really easy and tasty! Loved it!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Got this recipe from my sister last year and I have made it many many times and even put some in the freezer. It is sooooo good and everyone I have ever fixed it for wants the recipe. I have even made it for a friend that has to count sodium intake. I used no salt broth and seasoned myself. Best chicken chili recipe ever!!!!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Hands down one of the BEST soups we've ever had! The only thing we changed was adding one can of the green chilies instead of two. My nine year old couldn't get enough! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I have been making this chili for years. Everyone who tastes it asks for the recipe. Fantastic!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I have always enjoyed White Chili since it doesn't have the acid that is in regular chili. My friends here in Indiana would always say what's that ? Then I began sharing this recipe. One told me all she could do was smile with every bite. I agree. I just love the creaminess and the just right spices. I see why it is contest winning 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I've made this recipe many times for family and friends. Always a Huge hit...even with the pickiest of eaters. I do omit the whipping cream as it gives the chili a sweeter taste...and a lot more fat and calories! I also put shredded cheese, cilantro and lime on top. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very good. My family loves.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I made this for my husband and a friend and they both loved it! I only used one can of green chilies and I omitted the onions. I added 5 drops of potent hot sauce at the end, as well. It says it yields 7 servings, but I would say this comfortably feeds only 5 people.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#So GOOD! I make this about once a week during the winter time
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I've made this twice this week. It's great! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#The flavor in this was very good. It is easy to double for a large kettle. I found it slightly soupy for my taste but I added some mashed potato flakes and it was great. The leftovers made a great base for green chili chicken enchiladas.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#THIS IS MY NEW GO TO RECIPE!! I have already e-mailed it! TYVM for submitting it! I added a little white wine,cilantro added 1 c. chicken broth,as I added 2 potato's at the end as I roasted a spiced up chicken,potato's the night before for supper. Then used that in this recipe. Chipolte pepper's would be a nice change also. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is the best White Chicken Chili I have ever had.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I omitted the green chilis, and I loved it. Added some cheese and oyster crackers to my bowl and was delicious. I am going to make this again and again. Finally a chicken chili recipe that I can use.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#My guys LOVED this recipe! Ask for it on a regular basis now!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#SO GOOD! I omitted the green chilies because we don't like a lot of heat and it was still zippy and tasty. Added 1 cup frozen corn. Didn't have heavy cream, so I used 4 oz cream cheese instead. Also used 3 cloves garlic in place of the garlic powder. This is a wonderful cold weather meal! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was very easy and my family loved it. I did use lowfat sour cream and my son added cheese to his bowl.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I cut the calories and fat way down by using nonfat sour cream and substituting nonfat (skim) evaporated milk for the heavy cream and it is still yummy, a family favorite!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Wonderful recipe!!!! I used 8oz light cream cheese instead of the cream. Cuts way down on the fat.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was so good. The only thing I would do is leave out the salt and use lower sodium broth. It was great just too salty.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#It was tasty, but WAY TOO SPICY. I had to give it away because no one would eat it.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Quick and easy to make, my family asks for it all the time. I don't add the green chiles, instead I use ghost chiles , a very small amount. Adds a lot of heat and a wonderful smoky flavor. Delicious! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is a family favorite! I use canned chicken, reduce the broth and add a can of corn. Perfect with hot cornbread!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I've never made white chili before and wanted something different for our church chili cook-off. Made this recipe and won 1st place!! Excellent and very easy to put together. I made it in advance but did not add the sour cream and whipping cream. About 20 minutes before serving time I added the two ingredients and heated through. YMMMM 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I tried this on my family and my daycare girls and they all loved it and want it again
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is one of the best White Chili recipes I have found. I made it for a dinner party where one of the people is a very good chef. She thought this was so good and requested the recipe.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is a great recipe! I wish I had a contet to enter it in. The next I have a craving for chili, I'll make this. Mmm mmm good! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This white chili is awesome. I have shared the recipe many times. Family and friend favorite.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very easy and very delicious!! This is a keeper folks!! Next time may add some mushrooms and red bell pepper to bulk it up a little...but don't *have* to. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Oh my gosh...this is not only one of the easiest recipes I have made...but also one of the yummiest. LOVE IT. Also a great way to use left over turkey.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was superb! I was really easy to make too. I highly recommend it.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Flavorful and creamy. Loved the variation from regular chili!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I added one more small can of chilies, only 1/2 the salt, switched out the whipping cream for FF Half and Half but to keep the thickness I added some dark ale and cornstarch mixture to it. This is a keeper.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Garnish with CILANTRO!!! Additions: puree an additional can of beans to thicken chili; season chicken with poultry seasoning to enhance the flavor; add sliced cremini mushrooms for a heartier bowl.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Wonderful flavour, with just a little kick to it. Didn't have any cumin, so added a 1/2 teaspoon thyme. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is the best chicken chili I have ever had. It is worth the time to make. I suggest doubling the recipe though if more than 2 people are eating it as it doesn't make very much. The next time I make I'm going to try lowfat sour cream and whipping cream to try to cut down on the cals. Love it! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Amazing! My whole family loves this!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I made this for my family today and according to my husband and 8 yr old son, this is the best chili ever! I did, however, make a few changes. I used smoked turkey breast that my husband made over the holidays instead of the chicken. I also used 2 fresh garlic cloves (minced) and did not saute the meat, onion and garlic. I substituted Italian seasoning for the oregano and white pepper for the pepper. Last of all, I just dumped everything in the crock pot (set on high) for about 3 1/2 hours, adding the sour cream and cream the last half hour. DELICIOUS!!!!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#FABBBBUUUULLLLOOOUUUUSSSS! The best non-red chili I have ever had!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This recipe is delicious. I've been making this for at least 2 years. I serve this at bingo quite a few times during the winter. I've gotten so many compliments on this. It's also a favorite at home. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Yum, yum, yum! This was absolutely delicious! My husband, who doesn't usually eat this sort of thing loooves it. I double the recipe and put some in the freezer. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Excellent! The only thing I'd do different next time is use less sour cream. My picky eater who doesn't like anything spicy ate this and asked for seconds! Not spicy, don't let the cayenne pepper fool you! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I love love this recipe!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Great recipe! It was delicious!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Wowwwwww so good! Love it!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This soup is so good. I added 2 diced jalapenos and extra beans and used 1/2 & 1/2. Will be making this for Christmas Eve dinner with the kids. YUM!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Loved this chili! Made a few alterations taking a cue from other reviews, added a can of navy beans, chopped crimini mushrooms, a jalepeno and a bit extra cayenne pepper. Will make again, great recipe!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#My whole family loved this! I omitted the chilis and cayenne pepper. I replaced the heavy cream with half and half.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Not as creamy as the picture...more like a soup, but delicious!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I've made this too many times to count...but instead of using the chicken breast, I use smoked boneless chicken thighs (hubby cooks them). I modify the seasonings to suit our tastes. Today I used smoked cumin, alot of ancho chili pepper and ample cayenne. I use half-n-half instead of heavy cream, and light sour cream. Did I mention to add alot of garlic? This chili is always amazing!! It's a family fave! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now. It is extremely popular with family & friends. We like to serve with buffalo wing sauce for an extra kick.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Is our family's favorite soup in the world. My son-in-law HATES beans, but always requests I make this for him. I always have to double and triple the recipe because it is gone in a heart beat. Great with salad and bread. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#One of my absolute favorite recipes!!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Our favorite recipe! Instead of chicken I use browned ground turkey. Excellent!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I got this recipe years ago in a taste of home magazine. I have made it so many times my little recipe card is getting worn out!! It is incredibly yummy and so easy to make!!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is my first time making chicken chili.This just looked good so I tried it and it was really good.I used a whole chicken and made my homemade broth.Kicked it up with habanero pepper and smoked salt.I will make this again and again.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I make this recipe at least a half dozen times each year. To make it faster I buy a rotisserie chicken from the deli and add dried onions instead of fresh. Dinner can be ready in minutes and my entire family loves it!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I modified this recipe for the slow cooker. I used about 2 cups of COOKED, shredded chicken (and omitted the oil). I then added all the other ingredients, except the creams to the slow cooker. I also added an extra 2 cans of beans. I slow cooked on low for 6-7 hours and then added the creams about 30 min-1 hour before serving. It was delicious and I was very happy with the way i turned out in the crock! I have added it to my will make again recipe collection! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was delicious and super easy to prepare. I added fresh garlic and hot sauce and used light whipping cream. I also seasoned the chicken with a blend of poultry spice. This was so yummy! I was proud to serve it and will absolutely make it again!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Awesome! Every time I make this, someone asks me for the recipe. You can always play with the heat level by adding jalapeno.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Excellent. Will make often
Creamy White Chili#0#0#When cooking for others, this dish is one of the most requested. I like to use ground turkey instead of chicken breasts... it's cheaper and I like the texture a little bit better. My husband isn't a fan of chili, but he loves this! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#We make this recipe several times a year. A family favorite.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Delicious!!! This is a new favorite! The only things I added were 2 cans of black beans and half a bottle of beer. Great recipie! Thank you!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#One of our family favorites. Super easy to make and tastes wonderful. I sub. ground chicken for the breasts and it makes it even easier & more chili like.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#What a delicious alternative to regular chili! I had a sample before adding the creams and enjoyed it just as much as the finished product.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Very tasty!! Flavors were awesome! I agree with several of the reviews of it being too soupy. Next time I'll take the advice of several and add another can of beans. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks for a great recipe! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Wow this was yummy and yes I licked my bowl out LOL. I did how ever make a few changes because I'm watching my diet and it was still yummy. I didn't put the sour cream in it instead I used plain greek yogert. Also I didn't have garlic powder but I did have some garlic so i crushed up 3 cloves. I also used 1% milk not whipping cream and I put two cans of bean in and blended up one can of beans so it would be thicker. Left overs were even better today! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#My family LOVED this! With every bite they would mmmm and say this is so good, you have to make this again! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This recipe was delicious and will be made again. This recipe turned out a little soupier than the picture so next time I plan on adding 2 additional cans of northern beans. One can of beans, pureed, to help thicken the chili without adding additional fat and the other can just to add more'stuff' into the chili. Even though I will change a few things for my personal taste... this was delicious just'as is'. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I use 3 cans of beans, and 3 cans of green chili's for thicker chili. I cant even count how many times Ive cooked this. It never gets old. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is a favorite of my husband & mine. I add frozen corn to it. It's delicious with corn bread as a side. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#amazing!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#My husband doesn't like lots of beans so I only added one can of beans. In exchange I added a can of drained corn. I also added 1/2 c. sour cream and 1/2 c. plain lowfat yogurt. I also added 3 green onions. It turned out great. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Best while chicken chili I've ever had. Super delicious. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Easy and the kids loved it!! One of my favorites!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This chili is delicious and very easy to make! The sour cream at the end tames the bite of the chili but doesn't overpower the complementary flavors. Serve this with a nice hunk of baguette for a tasty lunch! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#My daughter first made this recipe and it since has become a favorite of everyone! I make mine with boneless, skinless chicken thighs that my husband smokes with hickory...it makes this chili beyond incredible!!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I make this quite often and every time I do, even folks (like my mother) who swear they don't like chicken chili, love it. I think it is absolutely perfect, the only change I make is using fresh garlic and toasting and grinding my own cumin seeds. Love Love Love this. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I love this recipe, although one time I made the mistake of adding jalapenos (cans were virtually identical) instead of the chilies which made it way too hot for my taste, but the rest of the group loves spicy food so it ended up working out! I have made it several times since then and everyone loves it!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#didn't like it - too creamy, too rich - i didn't feel good after having it. sour cream & whipping cream is overkill. would've been better with just whipping cream. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Even using only 1 can of green chilies, it was much too hot for us. Did not like at all.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Phenomenal!!!! I'm not normally a huge chili fan. This is definitely going on my favorites list! :D 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#WOW - used fresh garlic, added 2 tlb fresh cilantro, and rotisserie chicken (rather than cooking my own). Made day in advance - so it sat in the fridge one day - wow, was awesome and SOOOOO easy..Thanks a million
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Outstanding! I made this and took the leftovers to work...everyone asked for the recipe and a couple of people went home and made it that night! I did make a couple of small changes. I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder and because I didn't have any heavy cream I substituted a couple of tablespoons of cream cheese. This was soooooo good! Can't wait to make it again. Thank you for this recipe. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#My husband says this is the best chili he's ever had. It is delicious! This recipe is definatey a keeper. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I got this recipe from taste of home years ago and everyone loves it there are never any leftovers. We like it with tortilla chips instead of crackers or bread. Have shared it with church because everyone wants this recipe.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Excellent!! This one's a keeper for sure. 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#A winner with everyone at my house. Easy to make, nice bite without burning on the way down.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is the same recipe my father always made for me. Although, he always used just 1 4oz can of green chilies... but the people in my house weren't very good with hot food. 8oz gives enough heat that you can feel it, but it's not too overwhelming. Friends and family always love it! 
Creamy White Chili#0#1#Possibly if this soup was renamed as a Bean Soup it would be more fitting. This soup in no way is a White Chili soup. Very dissapointing.....
Creamy White Chili#0#0#this is great! I will make this several more times for sure!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Its so good. Its great over rice!!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I love this recipe. I have made it several times and it is a favorite. I usually use 3 cans of beans. I like more beans in my chilie. This is spicey so make sure to have bread handy. Excellent.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Made this last month. It was a big hit. Everyone was fighting for the leftovers.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I made this as is for a gathering and it was a huge hit. Even the little ones wanted seconds!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was delicious. I used only one can of chilis and used half and half instead of heavy cream. It was a hit in my family. Yum!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I loved this !!!! Very tasty
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Absolutely amazing!! Will make again and again. I will use one can of chilies this time instead though as we are feeding a few kiddos :)
Creamy White Chili#0#0#I added red pepper with onions in the beginning and also added corn with the beans. My boyfriend was skeptical about white chili, but this recipe is definitely a keeper!! I will be making this again for sure!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Everyone at work loved it. I made it for a chili cook off and work and I won. I made it exactly as the recipe reads only I doubled it. Great Recipe!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#AMAZING! Everyone in my house loves it! I have to double the recipe...sometimes triple it!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is seriously an AMAZING recipe! It was spicy, creamy and good on a cold Alaskan night. Next time I will probably use half & half or 2% milk instead of the heavy cream, no salt (you dont even need it) and greek yogurt instead of sour cream to make it more healthy. and I am sure it will still be amazing! mmmmmm.... Oh and double it if you want a second meal out of it because ours did not make the 7 servings it stated it would.
Creamy White Chili#0#0#Perfect dish for a snow day!
Creamy White Chili#0#0#made this recipe as written, and it was delicious! I even got a this is *really* good from my husband. The taste is wonderful, and it is totally going into my recipe box! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#A favorite! I have never made this for company without being asked for the recipe...don't need to tweak a thing! 
Creamy White Chili#0#0#a slight addition of smoked paprika really made this recipe pop very good stuff - thanks

Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was absolutely delicious! My only complaint was that it didn't make enough; I wanted more leftovers! I used 1/2 tsp salt instead of 1 tsp, and I used 1% milk instead of heavy cream. Turned out great.

Creamy White Chili#0#0#So good! Now I know what to make when I have to bring a dish to a potluck. This is so easy and so delicious, just as given. I plan to take leftovers and add peas, layer with pasta and breadcrumbs, and bake -- it's that rich!

Creamy White Chili#0#0#This is a keeper! I substituted what I had in the house, so I used 2 chicken boullion cubes in 2 cups water and 1/2 evaporated milk for the whip cream...It was DELICIOUS! I will make smaller chicken pieces next time so there is chicken in every bite. Highly recommend this recipe.

Creamy White Chili#0#0#Fantastic! My husband loves spicy foods, but the kids and I do not. So I compromised and used half the called-for amounts of both the green chiles and the cayenne. The result was a dish that was a hit across the board! After the first bite, all were requesting that this become a regular on our family dinner table.

Creamy White Chili#0#0#Being from a state where Beef is what's for dinner, my initial reaction to this recipe was less than excitement, but the reviews convinced me to give it a try. We really liked it a lot. I had to thicken it up a little with some cornstarch to suit my chili tastes. Next time I make it, I will add a vegetable like cabbage or corn to increase the textural diversity but overall this is a really good chili and I will make it again.

Creamy White Chili#0#0#I made this yesterday for a Chili & Soup Church Supper. It deserves all the stars it has been given. It was absolute delicious.

Creamy White Chili#0#0#I found this recipe September 2010. It's December 19th 2010 and I'm making it for the 3rd time. The first time I made it my mom had some and loved it and has made it probably 6 times since she tried it. My wife whom doesn't really care for chili loves it. It's really one of those things that sounds strange in your head. . Chili with chicken? Hrm.. I dunno. Just try it. It makes you nervous to try it, because it seems odd, but once you try it, it's awesome! No one in my family are huge onion people, so I always get a small onion and probably only use 3/4 of it, and I chop them up really tiny. This way the onions are not overpowering, but I think it would be missing something without them, so I wouldn't leave them out.

Creamy White Chili#0#0#I cut the recipe in half, but forgot to cut the spices in half. Because of that- this had a LOT of bite!! Also used white kidney beans as we can't get great northern beans where I live. Next time, when I make it properly, I think I will still cut back on the cumin and cayenne pepper.

Creamy White Chili#0#0#I made this on a cold Saturday while my hubby was putting up Christmas lights on the house. I used fake crab (instead of chicken) since I had that on hand and needed to be consumed. It made a really good soup-fast. Next time I will make it as stated with chicken but I would not hesitate with the substitution I used either! Nice recipe- thanks

Creamy White Chili#0#0#My favorite soup, so easy to make and tastes fantastic. I make this very often during the winter time. I use pre-cooked, chunked chicken breasts instead of cooking it in the pan.

Creamy White Chili#0#0#This white chili is excellent! I found this recipe in a Maine newspaper while on vacation many many years ago and clipped it out to take home to Virginia and try. It was a big hit and since then we have won 1st Place in many Chili contests over the other traditional red chili's. The men at my husbands work ask for me to make this every year when winter rolls around as a treat. Definitely a keeper to impress the boss or anyone.

I used boneless chicken thighs, I added 1 can kernal corn, 1 additional 10 oz can of broth, and chopped bell peppers with the onion. I also used light sour cream and 1/2 -1/2 since I didn't not have the heavy cream, and it was just great.

Creamy White Chili#0#0#This was a really great recipe. I was short one can of green chilies and think it would have helped to have both of them. Also, I didn't have whipping cream and substituted a small can of evaporated milk which work fine. I also used the low sodium chicken broth because the sodium count is pretty high on this. All in all a keeper.

Creamy White Chili#0#0#This soup was delicious and easy to make. It is unlike any white chili I have ever had. We did substitute while kidney beans for the great northern beans. We prefer kidney beans--they are a little firmer. And instead of the 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper the recipe calls for, we added 1/4 tsp of chili powder.

Creamy White Chili#0#0#My wife made this last night. She did substitute the white kidney beans for the great northern beans. The flavor is excellent for the family and I was able to kick it up a notch with some habanero powder at the table. I found the chili to be a little thin for my liking and it would benefit greatly from a rest period to get some more of the flavor into the beans.

Creamy White Chili#0#0#We always rate new recipe's & we gave this one a 10 I made this for dinner tonite w/crusty bagette. It was awesome. I cut back on the cumin & oregano to 1/2 teasp. Used only 1 can of green chilies. Used a whole garlic clove, & omitted the cayenne pepper.

Its always a big hit. I have even used turkey and cooked dry white beans in a crockpot to make this, still just fantastic!

Creamy White Chili#0#0#This chili is really good. I add milk instead of whipping cream (I think the whipping cream is too sweet), only one can of chilies, and 1 cup grated cheddar cheese right before serving. My husband said it tasted amazing!

Creamy White Chili#0#0#We thought this chili was absolutely fantastic. My husband said he would take this to his next chili cook off at work. Although the chili was great it was a bit too spicy for the younger ones in my family, but to be fair they really don't eat anything with any spiciness at all. we will make this again and again.

Creamy White Chili#0#0#Absolutely AWESOME! I've been making this since I first saw it in the magazine years ago. I've sometimes used pinto beans instead of white beans to save money, and adjusted the heat level depending on who would be eating it, but I always have people beg for the recipe!

Creamy White Chili#0#0#Super delicious! I had a feeling that with so many positive reviews it would be a hit. It's a challenge to find a dish that my entire family enjoys (kids ages 4 and 8, husband and myself)- but this was a winner! Creamy, hearty, perfect for a cold fall evening. Will be in my normal rotation! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the best recipe for banana bread I've ever tried. I've used it for over 20 years. It says it doesn't double well so I tripled it. It makes two large loaves after tripling. My question is can I substitute pumpkin purée for the bananas to make this into pumpkin bread with the appropriate spices? I know I could experiment but I'd rather ask first. Thank you. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#sweet and moist! I will be making this again
Best Ever Banana Bread#8#0#I made this bread with one minor twist. I live in FL and I have been collecting fresh mangoes every day on my way to work. I only had one ripe banana and a plethora of ripe ripe mangoes, so I did 114g of ripe banana puree and 114g of fresh mango puree. It turned out super tasty with gorgeous hues. I divided the batter into 4 mini loaves and baked for 40-45 minutes in my mini bread stone pan (until the toothpick came out clean). This way I was able to share the love a little further and pass out mini loaves to my co-workers, neighboors, and friends.
Best Ever Banana Bread#6#1#In place of the 1/2 cup of oil, I used another 1/2 cup of mashed banana. Ate it with a spread of butter on each slice, delish!
Best Ever Banana Bread#4#0#Made this for my book club, but used sour cream instead of buttermilk, which I was out of. *It came out great - they all asked for recipe
Best Ever Banana Bread#6#1#This recipe has an amazing flavor. I did change a few things. 1. I divided my sugar. 1 cup white 1/2 cup brown sugar. 2. I also used milk with a tablespoon lemon juice to substitute for the buttermilk that I didn't have. 3. I also lowered my temp to 325. I was using a cast iron bread pan. It cooks hotter. 4. I only cooked it for 1 hr. then let it cool for the 15 minutes. Loved the parchment paper. It definitely made clean up easier. Thank you for a tasty recipe. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#12#3#I have made this recipe several times. My family and neighbors like it. At 350 it always burns the bottom and the ends. Today I was determined to get a good one. I started at 350 but after reading some reviews lowered the temperature to 325. That made a nice banana bread not burnt. The bread bakes dark. Also I baked it for 1 hr 10 min. Given how many people have the burnt ends I think Taste of Home should make a correction or a comment.
Best Ever Banana Bread#3#0#Best Ever Banana Bread is a great recipe! No alterations needed :)
Best Ever Banana Bread#11#1#Add 1 tsp cinnamon to dry ingredients and it makes this recipe that much better!
Best Ever Banana Bread#5#1#Best banana bread ever. Used pecans instead of walnuts as a preference. Took about 1:23 in a gas range. Perfect.
Best Ever Banana Bread#7#0#Anyone ever try the Buttermilk Substitute for the buttermilk needed; use 1 tablespoon of white vinegar plus enough milk to measure 1 cup? (Then divvy out whats needed for the recipe.) Its a frigid day with everyone clamoring for Banana Bread! Dont want to trek out to the store!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Good one
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Delicious banana bread!
Best Ever Banana Bread#6#0#Perfect banana bread! Had 3 ripe ones so used them. Otherwise baked per recipe even the timing. Very moist. Looks identical to your pic!
Best Ever Banana Bread#16#3#I make this so often I have the recipe memorized! I usually make 1/2 of it in muffin tins and the rest in a small loaf pan. I individually wrap the muffins with plastic wrap and put in a freezer zip lock bag to freeze. It is easy to pull one out and defrost in the microwave. My husband loves them for breakfast desert . I usually substitute applesauce for the oil and add cinnamon because my husband loves it. Sometimes I substitute almond extract for the vanilla. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#6#1#This banana bread tasted great and it was very easy to prepare. I love that it uses oil as the fat - makes preparation so fast and easy!
Best Ever Banana Bread#3#15#I was excited to try this recipe. Followed it to the letter. Bread didn't rise properly, the sides and bottom were burned and the middle was still mush. I greased my pans really heavily so it would not stick. Still stuck. I'm only giving this 2 stars because it was an easy recipe. What a waste of ingredients. We couldn't even eat it. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#5#0#The title is not a lie! agree ?? this is the best banana bread. Very simple ingredients and easy to make. The only thing I changed is the buttermilk which I substituted to vanilla yogurt since I do not have buttermilk at home. It taste so delicious and moist. I cooked about 1 hr and 10 mins. Cooled it down and wrapped in a foil and placed in the refrigerator and it was perfect ?? yummy ?? banana ?? bread ?? ever...
Best Ever Banana Bread#2#1#I have made this bread, large and small loaves and muffins, many times and it has turned out perfect everytime. I always use whole wheat flour and brown sugar and/ or a little honey, and cut back on they sugar a little. I also add blueberries, dried cherries, apple and rhubarb, sometimes separately or in some combination. They also add some sweetness so i can reduce the sugar, and extra moisture to compensate for the whole wheat flour. The best banana bread anywhere and everyone that eats mine says the same thing! Thank you for sharing a great recipe!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#3#4#I have not tried this recipe yet, however, I would suggest using a scale and measure the ingredients before mixing. I was taught this by my Mom. I made a directory of all items...flour, sugar, oats, nuts...example. flour ...one cup is 4-1/4 oz. quick oats..one cup 2.82 oz...and so forth...might be worth checking it out??
Best Ever Banana Bread#7#2#I have used this recipe for almost 30 years. It is the best. For those that have had problems, I have used wide pan loaf pans. It does cook dark. But if you cook for 1 hour 20 minutes at 325, rotating half way through, you will be successful. Try adding mini morsels. You'll also want to store in a zip top bag and refrigerate. Enjoy!
Best Ever Banana Bread#3#3#Great taste on this bread but I've tried it a couple times and I'm having the same issue as a previous reviewer . The sides brown way to much, long before the loaf is done . I tried doubling the recipe and making 3 loaves to cut the cook time but still had the same problem ...maybe ill try muffins out of it next time . 
Best Ever Banana Bread#2#0#Gin, I'm sorry your bread failed. I had that problem too. During Covid I was t able to get my usual flour aid I settled for an different brand. It failed every time. Now I have my Gold Medal All-Purpose Flour again and it's terrific!! Try Gold Medal. This really is the best recipe I've ever tried.
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#2#Followed recipe exactly and first time using this recipe. I was very disappointed in how it turned out - did not raise and edges burned even tho' I thought it a good idea to loosely cover with foil once I saw the edges browning. This was supposed to be a gift but could not in good conscience, give it to anyone. Have not tasted it yet ....But in the future, will go back to my reliable stand-by recipe (which I thought was lost but have since found) as something is not quite right with this one. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#2#0#I try a variety of banana bread recipes and this 1 is easy and everyone loves ir. My husband said that we could stay with this recipe from now on!
Best Ever Banana Bread#8#5#Ok.. I make banana bread at least twice a month with the OLD bananas...as we never manage to eat a full bunch. So yes this is a good basic recipe, and yes I changed a bunch. I added butter instead of canola oil, one stick, added a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, yes and three bananas instead of two, did not have butter milk but used a 1/4 cup of Almond milk, how did it taste? Lol. I will let you know.
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#Wonderfully easy, and delicious!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I had 4 ripe bannas so i used all of them in this recipe. Used cake flour. I did not have butter milk but made my own with heavy cream and white vinegar which turned into a sour cream consistency. Used banna extract and vanilla. Omitted the nuts. Poured into bundt pan. For some reason some of it stuck to the sides of the pan (so will try loaf pan w parchment next time)....Made a frosting with heavy cream, powder sugar, pinch salt, cinnamon. This was a hit, i will definitely use this recipe again!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this recipe into muffins. Yield 12 medium sized and 8 mini muffins. I swapped 1 cup of the sugar for Splenda and used 1/2 cup of regular sugar. I added mini chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of walnuts. Excellent! Will make it into a loaf next time as well.
Best Ever Banana Bread#2#0#This really is the best banana bread recipe. Actually, I use the Pampered Chef brownie pan and make muffins using the recipe. Makes 24 and baking time is about 15 minutes. I lessen the sugar to 1 cup. Sometimes I add mini chocolate chips. I also use this recipe with ground zucchini using the full amount of sugar. (I grind or finely grate the zucchini and squeeze out the moisture.)
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#1#This is the easiest and best tasting banana bread ever. I put raisins in one loaf and blueberries in another, yum.
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#This is definitely the best banana bread I have ever made. I made extra loafs to give to family members and they all raved about how good it was. On some loaves I did add a little nutmeg and cinnamon and it also tasted good with those spices. Either way, this is the best banana bread!!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#1#this is the one I have been looking for finally after 2 years
Best Ever Banana Bread#3#1#This by far is the best banana bread I've made. In fact, much less time consuming than ones I've used in the past. I included half a cup of dark semi-sweet chocolate chips, which made a delicious combination with the walnuts. This one is a keeper! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I've been a fan of banana bread ever since I was a child and this one is delicious! I substituted chocolate chips for the walnuts, which my husband and I enjoyed. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#One of the easiest banana breads I've ever made! My kids even helped make it and it turned out perfect. We opted to make it gluten 
Best Ever Banana Bread#2#0#This really is the best banana bread. I did add an extra small banana and used toasted pecans because that is what I had. This is moist and flavorful. It's everything you want and hope in a banana bread. Normally with a slice of banana bread I butter it. This is so good I didn't need the butter. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Very easy, moist and delicious! A keeper for sure!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#1#I use 1 cup of bananas, whatever nuts I have on hand. Sometimes I add 1.5 cups blueberries (takes longer to cook). Sometimes Apples. I like to cook these in mini-loave pans. I get four out of the recipe. For Blueberry I cooked for 40-45min. All others 30-35mins.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#1#Love this recipe!! I never liked banana bread, but this recipe has changed my mind. I have mad it several times now, and also gave a loaf to relatives who also loved it. Easy to make and freezes well. My mom likes to slice and bag it separately for the freezer, then she has a snack that thaws quickly. I would do the same, but we wind up eating it all before I can freeze any. Definitely recommend trying this recipe!
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#Very good recipe. Delish! Question: I would like to add chocolate chips instead of the walnuts. (Grandkids prefer the chocolate chips.) How much would I add? 1 cup, like the chopped walnuts? And what about a mixture of chocolate chips and nuts? 1/2 cup of each?
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#I made the recipe as given, but substituted toasted pecans for the walnuts, and baked in paper lined muffin pans. This recipe made 18 regular size muffins. These were very moist and delicious! I will definitely make these again!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#So delicious and easy to make. You can put add ins if you want to change it up for your family, but it is good just as written. Will file this one for future use!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Absolutely delicious! This really is the best banana bread. Mine baked at 325 for about an hour and a half. I used the chocolate chip option instead of walnuts and threw in a handful of leftover toffee bits as well. This bread is moist on the inside, with a crispy crust on the outside. Can't say enough about it. We loved it and will definitely make again~ VFE 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#It's true, it's the best banana bread that I've ever made or tasted. I used pecans as that's what I had on hand. Muffins great idea. Be sure to use a larger loaf sized pan. Baking time varies. My bake time over an hour. VFE. A must try.
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#My favorite banana bread recipe. I make it as muffins, which bake for around 24 minutes. Delicious!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I love this banana bread! Never ever had I used a different recipe!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#It was wonderful. I made two loaves and put chocolate chips in one. They were both delicious. This recipe will be added to my favorite recipes. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have used a lot of different recipes but this one is by far the best! My mom always put the bread on a paper plate when almost completely cooled and placed into a sealed plastic bag overnight and it makes it so moist! I will use this recipe again!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#2#0#As advertised, this recipe truly is the best banana bread EVER! Since finding this recipe a month ago, I have made three loaves. My husband can not eat it fast enough. I shortened the cooking time to 1 hour 10 minutes (I think it depends on the type of pan you use) . results are amazing! Definitely will cook again and again!
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#Delicious and tasty. Used 1/4 cup less sugar and it was plenty sweet. Husband says it a keeper . Shared with family THANK YOU 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#So easy and tasty!!! This truly is delicious.... the taste that I was looking for. We've toasted our slices and had it with butter and it was simply delish!!!!!!! Thank you for the recipe!!!! For the first time ever, I wish I had more bananas to bake more breads!!! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Made this cake twice First time , we fond too sweet ( too much sugar) second time, wait better, as I put just i cup of sugar. did put a bet of coconut essence to give an extra taste, It is a very easy cake to make, and very good . ***** did not have butter milk, so I put yogurt . A slice of it is now my husband favorite breakfast.
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#I haven't actually put this recipe to the test yet because we just installed a different oven last night and i still need to clean it. but the main reason is that i have a special needs diet so i will have to substitute almost every ingredient in order to be able to eat it safely. I'm not sure if anyone else out there is a vegan/diabetic with no immune system but if you are then you've got a friend. The good news is that so far the things I have made substitutions for have been on me and my family so I will be happy to share the rating and the substitutions used if anyone is interested--or I could just write a book--- LOL 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Best flavored banana bread I have ever had. The English Walnuts add that special crunch and flavor. This is a keeper. I didn't change a thing! It will replace my regular banana bread recipe! Thank you! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#Good recipe. I substituted 1/4 cup brown sugar plus 1 1/4 cup white sugar. I also slightly toasted (and cooled) the walnuts prior to folding them into the batter. I buttered the pan and coated it with flour, as well. I like the buttermilk. The texture was outstanding. I will make this often.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I've tried many best banana bread recipes but this one really IS best. It is very moist and I've found others too dry for my liking. I did the recipe as written except had 3 bananas that needed to be used. Flavor is good and makes large loaf. I will definitely be making again 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Banana bread has never been my favorite. Turns out I had the wrong recipe! After making this, it's now my favorite! Title didn't lie, this IS the Best Ever Banana Bread! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#3#Not even close to the best banana bread. I followed the recipe verbatim so I didn't add numerous additional ingredients and say I made the recipe. As a matter of fact, I made a better loaf yesterday using a different recipe that was also called the best banana bread. The recipe simply doesn't have enough bananas in it. Its a nice bread but has limited banana flavor. I would suggest looking for a different recipe. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#1#I have used this recipe for years..with the addition of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger. I personally find banana bread boring without the spice. I also add walnuts and sometimes chocolate chips to batter. The best base recipe. In use this for making pumpkin bread or zucchini. It freezes very Well and often is better once thawed out.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#1#This is without a doubt the best banana nut bread recipe I have ever found!! I always have bananas and have made countless different recipes but never found one I really liked until I made this one. I followed the directions from start to finish and wouldn't change a thing. This bread is so moist and has the best flavor. I would completely agree with it's name....Best Ever Banana Nut Bread! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is so easy and delicious!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#My family and I loved the bread. I used pecans instead of walnuts. I only used 1/4 cup of buttermilk. I don't understand how an extra tablespoon could make a difference. ??? I will definitely make again.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#1#Excellent ad easy! I sprinkled some sugar on top and it was excellent with our morning coffee. I said was, it was gone fast. I will be making this regularly.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#The title says it all. I use brown sugar instead of white. I leave out the nuts; just a personal preference. Sometimes I add chocolate chips in place of the nuts.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This banana bread is outstanding. I have never had better and so simple to make! I have made at least 6 times with a perfect outcome each bake. I do use 2 1/2 mashed bananas, and like another viewer, use just a touch of sugar on top before baking. Any banana bread I've ever tried was too dry, but not this one! Super moist and sooooo delicious! Winner here! I highly recommend!!!!! cnaquin 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This banana bread is very good and moist. I've made it several times with and without the nuts and everytime it's tasty. The cook time might be a bit long bc mine comes out a little darker than I'd expect but the taste is still really good regardless.
Best Ever Banana Bread#2#0#Just as it says. The Best Ever Banana Nut Bread . I have made this Nut Bread six times. Three times for friends and three for myself. I did, however, use, coconut, rum, and vanilla extract, ( one teaspoon each) and raw cane sugar instead of regular sugar. The very best I've ever had. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This was delicious. I made one with chocolate chips and the other with toasted walnuts.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is now my go to recipe for banana bread! We made a loaf with chocolate chips and a loaf with walnuts. Excellent!!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Love, love, love this recipe and was so easy to make. Moist and delicious. Gone in a couple of hours.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Awesome recipe, simple and delicious!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#turned out well
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#1#I love this banana bread. I make it exactly like it says and It comes out amazing everytime. I make it for every family gathering. They all love it. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#1#Absolutely scrumptious!! Fixed this today and the aroma filled the house. I plan on giving this as gifts for the holidays!!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Perfect banana bread, just as written. However, due to health reasons I have successfully substituted coconut milk for the buttermilk, reduced the sugar to 1cup and reduced the oil to 1/4 cup by adding an extra banana. And just for personal taste and to look pretty, I like to sprinkle the walnuts (mixed with a bit of sugar) on the top of the bread just prior to baking.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#CANT SEE THE ENTIRE RECIPE!:( :(
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I was in a rush and wanted something quick for banana bread....I love this recipe! The bread was moist and delicious, super quick to mix! Just a note when I don't have buttermilk I use milk w cider vinegar ( 1 cup milk to 1 tbs vinegar) it works just as well in a pinch!
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#I have made every banana bread you can think of and this is our family's favorite. Thank you to the author. I also only use the recipe exactly as written people please don't rate if you change it.
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#Hi I love this recipe I don't always have buttermilk so I use yoghurt and I freeze banana's when on special and slice them into the melted butter mix. And everyone loves it. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Just okay. It's your average banana bread. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I put it together in minutes so it is a quick way to use over-ripened bananas. I do like sugar so I added the recipe amount as well as topped it with Demerara Cane Sugar just so it looks pretty when baked. I did add craisins, raisins and pecans to the mixture as well.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#When I took it out of the oven, I wasn't too excited with how dark the bread was and the fact that it caved in the center some. Looking at the picture, I see that one caved in the center some as well. I did add more flour because of our altitude, perhaps I needed to add a little more. It is a very sweet bread and not the usual banana bread flavor that I prefer but my husband was very happy with it. He commented several times that it was good bread. I do like how moist it is. The main thing to note is it's a sweet bread and despite the darkness of it when it comes from the oven and tastes fine and is moist. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I added 1/2 cup soaked raisins. Mmmm
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#1#Very nice banana bread. Extremely easy and quick to make. I doubled the recipe, and instead of sugar, I used a sugar substitute called WHOLE EARTH sweetener Co., so I only needed half of the amount of sugar because it's very sweet. I baked it in a round 23cm pan, on 165 degrees (I'm in Australia) for 1.5 hours, and for the last 10 minutes I had to cover it with a piece of foil to stop it browning too much. It's quite moist and flavourful, perfect with a cuppa. Next time I might add some cinnamon to the mix before baking.......hmmmmmm??. Thank you for a beautiful recipe. My four children lloovveedd it. My 10 year old ate at least 5 pieces in one sitting. Very good! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#1#Delicious!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I love this banana bread. I've made many times. I don't think it's too sweet-in fact I always add a glaze. I also usually use pecans instead of walnuts-but I've made with both. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I just love this banana bread - which in my version is more like a cake:-) Don't like walnuts so I use pecans and then I throw in a good handful of dark chocolate chips. Yum Yum... 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This banana bread recipe is delicious. I give it a 5-star rating, even though it was a bit too sweet. Next time I'll try omitting 1/4 or 1/2 cup of sugar. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#1#This is my go to banana bread recipe, made the following changes. Reduced sugar to 1/3 cup sugar, added 1/3 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 tea of baking powder. Used melted coconut oil for canola oil. My bread only took 45-50 minutes to bake at 325. Due to nut allergies l don't add nuts. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#1#Excellent!
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#As written this has far too much sugar for my taste. . 1 C. Was plenty the 2nd time around,especially since I used 3 bananas that were black. Reducing the sugar and upping the banana by 1 gives far more banana flavor.. Black bananas are much sweeter, so no sweetness is lost.i think i will stick to my normal recipe. Sorry.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Delicious, we like our banana bread with a strong banana taste so I used 1 1/2 cups of mashed bananas ?? and followed the rest of the recipe as is.
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#1#This is really the best recipe for banana bread! I made this bread many times with the great result every time. When I tested this bread, I followed the recipe exactly, did no substitutions and my bread turned out perfect. Easy to make and delicious. I made this bread with substitutions too (yogurt or sour cream for buttermilk, raisin for nuts, more spices) and it has never failed my expectations! I highly recommend this recipe. You will not be disappointed!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this recipe as is .... no changes or substitutions. I found it to be moist and delicious ..... loaded with banana flavor. Highly recommended!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#1#Have not made this, would like to know what recipe to follow? Did any one make it by the original recipe???? and how many star did it get???????
Best Ever Banana Bread#3#0#So, when people give this recipe 5 stars, and have altered 8 of the 10 ingredients called for, they are really giving themselves the highest rating. This makes me so angry. Make the recipe the way it is submitted, and give credit to the author.
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#This was the first thing I have ever baked from scratch and it was incredibly delicious. Six stars in my book.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this delicious loaf today and it is a winner. I made only two minor changes. I substituted sour cream for the buttermilk which I did not have and used pecans. I opted to sprinkle chopped pecans over the loaf just before popping it in the oven. We love this bread and I will be making it many more times. I highly recommend this recipe. Volunteer Field Editor
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have been using this recipe for years on end whenever my bananas are ripe and it has never failed my expectations! I substitute the canola oil with safflower oil, only put in 1 cup of sugar, and use 1 more banana than recommended. Instead of using buttermilk, which I never have in my fridge, I use half and half and it works perfectly fine!Love love love this recipe, it's totally worth a shot!! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Great Recipe. I also altered it as recommended by other users. I only used 1/2c sugar as my banana's were really ripe. I used three banana's and added 1tsp of cinnamon and used 1/4c of coconut oil . My bread was done after 40min so keep your eye on it, as it does not take over an hour to bake. Next time I might add baking powder, as mine didn't come out as high and fluffy as I would have liked it.

Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is AMAZING! I made a few adjustments, based on other reviews, and can't believe that everyone in my family likes it! Even my daughter who said, Eww, banana bread?? Lol! She loved it!My adjustments:I substituted 1/4 of the white sugar with brown sugar, used 2 1/2 bananas and reduced oil to 1/4 cup, used 1 tsp vanilla paste for the vanilla, added 1 tsp cinnamon and a tiny pinch of ginger and nutmeg. It does take quite awhile to bake, but be patient. It's totally worth it!!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have been making this bread for many years. I double the recipe and do two 9x5 loaf pans. I always start my timer for 45 minutes and then start checking the bread after that for doneness. It truly is the best ever banana bread.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have a similar recipe. Use 1 cup sugar, 3/4 cup oil and bake in 3 smaller pans which are great as gifts or to keep in the freezer. I spray the bottom of the three pans and sprinkle with oatmeal to keep from sticking. Bake at 335 degrees for 35-36 minutes. my husband likes blueberries rather then nuts.So good, hard to keep them on hand.
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#OMG make sure you grease AND FLOUR the TWO (2) pans you will need. One pan is not enough for this much dough. AND it DOES NOT take 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours to bake. 45 to 55 min is MORE then plenty to bake 2 loaves. Enjoy
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#A really, really good recipe. I don't usually tried recipes that are labeled best ever, but I had the ingredients for this one. The bread is moist, is has the right texture and strong banana flavor. A definnite winner. I used a scant cup on the oil simply because I ran out and it was still very moist.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#It's in the oven now. Sure smells good baking! I checked at one hour and was still gooey in center. Checked again in 5 minutes (as suggested by another reviewer) and it was done! I had lined the loaf pan with parchment paper, so I cooled for 10 minutes and lifted it out to finish cooling. Smells and looks delicious! My whole house smells like bananas!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This turned out wonderfully. I used bananas that were black to get a great banana flavor.I think I may try less sugar next time. perhaps 1 cup.
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#This is my favorite banana bread recipe, I think my family lets the bananas turn brown so I will make this. LOL The only thing I do is dust the pans(I always double it, and put 1 loaf in the freezer) with cinnamon & sugar. YUMMMMMMMY
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I will never look for another banana bread recipe! This one completely lives up to its name!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is definitely the best banana bread I've ever tasted. My whole family loves it. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Whenever I have extra bananas this is the recipe I reach for to make banana nut bread. In fact I have shared it 5 times with different friends; it's that good. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Omitted the walnuts due to allergies. Sprinkled turbinado sugar on top before baking. It disappeared fast, definitely will double the recipe next time!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I've been making this recipe for years! I found it in a church cookbook. I'm now famous for this recipe among my family, friends and coworkers. It's so moist, unlike most banana bread recipes. Yes, it comes out dark. It has sort of chewy crust that everyone loves. I can't say enough about this recipe. It's absolutely the best!! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This recipe is fast, easy and delicious! I also used less sugar and oil than specified along with extra banana and milk. I also used half brown sugar instead of all white and I added some cinnamon and allspice. I LOVE the idea of putting some of the nuts on top before baking (I'll be sure to do that next time). Also, I made 12 muffins and that baking time was about 35-40 min. YUMMY!! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#1#I gave this recipe three stars as 1) canola oil is so unhealthy. I used organic coconut oil instead, plus about a tablespoon of butter. 2) I used 1/2 cup of sugar and used 3 large overripe bananas instead of two (I didn't measure but it was probably more than the 1 cup of bananas called for in the recipe). In addition, because of the extra banana, I was able to cut the eggs down to one but I did use a large egg.I added 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup chocolate chips, as my family likes that, but they aren't necessary as I tasted the mixture before baking and it was plenty sweet. I wasn't sure about baking it at 325 degrees...so halfway through I upped it to 350 degrees. I don't think it made any difference...but I do have a convection oven. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#My grandson (he's 5) and I LOVE this recipe. He loves that we have a DRY bowl AND a WET bowl. Sometimes when our bananas aren't rotten enough, we will pick up some organic banana baby food. Works great! He calls it our Banana Buck Bread. We like pecans as our Bucks instead of walnuts.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#1#This is by far the worse recipe I have used for banana bread.it calls for way too much oil,I bake dog treats for a living and they smell better than this bread.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I really wanted some banana bread, but did not have a Go to recipe. I trust Taste of Home so I came here to look for one. This one rocks! Easy recipe with basic ingredients. Turned out great. It's a keeper! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I've tried all kinds of banana bread muffins and bread recipes and always a flop! This one was easy and minimal ingredients - I used a metal pan (all I had) and cooked for 1.10 hours, 2.5 regular bananas! OMG it was fabulous--I will make it again and recommend to any and all novice cooks! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#Our family loves this recipe so much that I keep the right amount of buttermilk frozen in baggies just so I will have it on hand when our bananas get a little too ripe and I make this bread. My grandson suddenly stopped eating bananas and as it turned out, he was letting them get too old so we would have banana bread! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have made this Banana bread more times than I can count! It's the only recipe I use and as my husband is a Diabetic, I make it with 1 cup of Splenda. It is plenty sweet and delicious, besides the walnuts I sometimes add Craisins. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Very good recipe, but on the sugar, I used 3/4 brown sugar and 3/4 regular white sugar. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Emily, Thank you for adding your comment of using 3 bananas & not adding the oil, This is great!, less calories. There is added value when adjustments are made to the recipe. This helps to cut down on calories or use substitutes. Very much appreciated.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#1#I have made this several times and everyone who has eaten this says This is the best banana bread they have ever eaten ! If I don't have buttermilk I will use milk with about a TB of vinegar and it still has been great. This is very moist and delicious. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have been making this very recipe since the 70's and everyone loves it. Got it in the newspaper Detroit News.... the very best banana bread for sure. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#My family loves this recipe. Ask for it regularly.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#My absolute favorite recipe! I add extra bananas if I have them and keeps it extra moist. I also use powdered buttermilk to make the 1/4 cup buttermilk so I always have buttermilk available in my kitchen. Highly recommend this recipe!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#OK, I'll admit, I *HATE* it when someone submits a review and is either challenging the authenticity based on the recipe name versus the ingredients used, or has NOT even MADE the recipe, or has made it and says but I made changes ... so what am I about to do??? LOL I am going to tell you that I *LOVE* this recipe, although the version that I was given does NOT use the buttermilk, walnuts or vanilla, uses 1/2 tsp baking soda, 2 tsp baking powder. and reduces the sugar to 3/4 cup, all else is the same (I *know*, it's NOT THE SAME, right!?!?!). I *do* love nuts in my banana bread, and I *have* added them in the past. The buttermilk, however, adds a dairy product that my wife doesn't tolerate well (lactose intolerant), So for those of you looking for a non-dairy version, I suspect you can omit the buttermilk from this recipe and still have an awesome result. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Isn't that called Banana Nut bread? 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I loved this! I had three bananas I needed to use up, so I replaced the canola oil with another banana. It came out so moist and delicious!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I just made this today. From a previous reviewer, I also cut the sugar down to 1 cup and this is the best banana nut bread I made. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I've tried a lot of banana bread recipes, and this really is the best ever! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the best banana nut bread that I have ever eaten.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made it for my clients and they asked for it again and again. So tonight I'm making it again 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Fantastic old fashion recipe! I did decrease the sugar to 1 cup as to make it healthier...and could not tell the difference. Just like Grandmas!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#The name says it all! Second to none in my book. Delicious!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Just made today! Delicious
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I love this recipe. I've used it dozens of times and it always turns out. Sometimes I add choc chips or coconut and it is always delicious and moist. I use half the sugar and use vanilla flavoured stevia drops in place of vanilla. It adds enough sweetness. I also use whole wheat flour. I replace the oil with apple sauce. Even with all these exchanges it turns out great 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have hard time calling this the best ever . It took 30 min longer than estimated to bake and the top was all crusty and dark because of the high amount of sugar. I also made a batch of the basic banana bread muffins and preferred that recipe a lot more. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#My husband loves this Banana Bread. I often substitute chocolate chips for the walnuts and serve it as a dessert.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I live at 7200 ft and didn't modify (other than swapping pecans for walnuts out of preference), and it turned out great for anyone else at high altitude who might be wondering. Only cooked it for about 1 hr;10 min. Delicious! I was concerned about the top getting too dark as one commenter stated as that often happens to me with baking, but it was right in the center of my oven and came out perfectly browned. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#It is the best recipie ever. I even used 3 old frozen runny bananas and it was delicious!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Didn't change a thing! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Perfect!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I love this recipe! It is easy to mix together, and the end result tastes great. I like to wrap the cooled loaf in foil and let it sit overnight prior to serving/eating, as this makes it much more most. This banana bread is so good!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#My family loves this bread. Sometimes I replace the walnuts with pecans or mini chocolate chips but otherwise, make it according to the recipe.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is my favorite banana bread recipe. It always comes out perfect.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#The taste and texture of this banana bread is perfect and my family loved it. My personal preference is for the top crust to not be as dark. I couldn't get the bread to cook all the way through without the top getting a dark brown. (I made 2 loaves and put a piece of foil over one of them and it still turned out a dark brown.) As I said, that is my personal preference. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Wonderful!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is my go to banana bread. Never lasts long around here!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This was very good. I omit the nuts, but it really had nice flavor. I reduced the cook time by about 10 minutes, I did the toothpick test on my smaller loaf pan just in case, then decided to check the larger as well, they were both done.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#BEST. BANANA. BREAD. *EVER*!!!I've been using this recipe for five years now (or more!) But never actually submitted a review! And the very first time I made it I fell in love! I'm very picky with my banana breads (True story!). This is ALWAYS my GO-TO recipe to give away as treats to family/friends or to make and keep at home (but it doesn't last very long!). I've made it exactly the way it shows in the recipe. And it's AMAZING!! However Being the curious and advanced chef/baker that I am, I changed a few ingredients to health it up a bit. You're welcome to adopt my style! Here's what I did:Used 1 cup unbleached flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat( i've also used gluten free flour blend and it works just as well )Used 1/2 cup white or raw organic sugar, 1/2 cup brownUsed 1/2 cup avocado oil instead of veg or canola (no taste diff and SO MUCH healthier!)Made my own buttermilk (1/2 cup milk with 1/2 tablespoon vinegar. Stir and Let sit 5 mins. Discard a bit to give just over 1/4 cup.Mix well. Stir in mini chocolate chips (or 60% dark chunks) and poof!! Magic! An unbelievable, healthy and DELICIOUS banana bread!!! I bake at 325F for 65 mins everytimeBon Appetite!! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Very nice texture and flavor. Takes a long, long time to cook; more than the usual banana bread recipe. The crust on the outside of the bread turned out a little thick, though I did not burn it. Will most likely make again and experiment with the baking temperature.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#One of the best recipes I've tried. Bread was moist. Kids and nephews ate it all up. Will definitely be making this again.If you're going to be making mini loaves like I did you'll need to set your timer to 30 minutes instead of1 hour. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have been on the hunt for a good banana bread recipe. My husband has hated every recipe I have made and only likes his grandmas. I got his grandmas recipe and made it. And guess what? Did it turn out like grandmas? No. I tried this recipe last night. I used 3/4 of the all mixed, finished batter and put hat into a loaf pan. The remainder of the mix was used for mini muffins. I did this because my sister said that every banana bread recipe is actually meant for 2 loafs. This recipe did not say to divide this into two loaf pans. But my sister swore by this. No the bread did not need to bake the total amount of time that was asked. This was due to not putting the whole batch in one pan. I sincerely believe that not using the whole batch in one pan is what helped this stay nice and flavorful and slightly moist. Most breads come out too dry when I use the whole batch in one pan and cook for recommended time. My sister was right. Thanks sis! The bread did turn out looking a little darker although that did not change the taste of this AMAZING recipe. I kept a eye on the bread after a half hour and did the tooth pick trick to see when my bread was done. Finally I have a banana bread recipe I will be excited to add to our family favs cook book!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this yesterday, it's gone today. It definitely has the right name. It was absolutely THE BEST BANANA BREAD EVER. The second time I made it today I changed one thing, I halved the amount of nuts and added dark chocolate chips for the other half. It also was exceptionally delicious. The original recipe is so moist and light, not oily and mushy like a lot of recipes. Thank you so much for another of your recipes. All I have tried have become big hits with my family. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#We love this recipe! It is the only banana bread recipe I use. I have a nut allergy so I never add the walnuts, but sometimes I add chocolate chips, sometimes I add 1/4 cup cocoa and chocolate chips, sometimes I add fresh blueberries, sometimes I don't add anything. No matter how it is made it turns out great! Sometimes I even make them as muffins! Such a great recipe! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#We just love this bread.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#My go to recipe for banana bread. Excellent as written. I have double it and used a tube cake pan for easier presentation. Over time I have left out the nuts and added 1 tsp Cinnamon for our household preference.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Best ever!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Great recipe. I didn't have buttermilk so I used my unsweetened coconut milk, and didn't have canola oil so I used olive oil unsure of how it would turn out and everyone loved it! Next time I think I will do 1/4 c less sugar as it is plenty sweet. This is the one I will use from now on. It took 1 hr 25 min. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Not only did I roast the bananas but the walnuts as well. I also added chocolate chips. Yummy recipe! I will make this one again and again! I freeze my buttermilk into ice cube trays. So it is always handy!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Great recipe, but way too much sugar for our liking. I made a double batch this time and used 1c. Sugar toral. I always add cinnamon with a sprinkle of nutmeg. I dont ever have buttermilk so i always use milk and vinegar with great results. Made 1 loaf pan and 2 mini loaves; minis took about 50 mins, large took 1 hr 15 mins. Delish!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#While I am not a huge fan of just plain banana bread, I must say this one is good. I did add cinnamon to the batter because my family loves it. I didn't add any nuts because DD doesn't like them; however, I would add pecans if I were making this to give away. Husband and I prefer pecans, but that is just a preference thing. Will definitely make again. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Next time I will try only one cup sugar. I didn't have any buttermilk so added 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar to the milk. The only other change I made was using Saffola instead of canola. My grandson suggests adding chocolate chips next time as he likes them in everything. Really good and very moist. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Best of all my banana bread recipes.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Absolutely amazing!! I always make mini loafs to share the deliciousness :) thank you for sharing!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Love this recipe
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the best banana bread ever! It never turned out so good before. I like it because it's fluffy and the bananas weren't as good to eat anymore but when I baked it, it turned out delicious. I give it 5 stars.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I make this any time I have bananas that are really ripe, it's really good! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Excellent recipe. I skipped the nuts because I didn't have any and it still turned out tasty. Next time I will make sure I have walnuts because I'm sure it will be even better. I read the reviews and decided to use only 1 cup of sugar and added a teaspoon of cinnamon. This is now my go to banana bread recipe. Very fast and easy. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I followed the directions exactly except for adding 1 cup of Hershey cinnamon chips along with the walnuts. Came out AMAZING.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have used a recipe very similar to this one since 1966. Mine uses 1 stick of margarine instead of oil, only 1 cup of sugar, 3 mashed bananas not 2 and no buttermilk or vanilla plus I've always used pecans and not walnuts but that is a matter of preference. Instead of bread, I often make miniature muffins and we love the muffins. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is really a great recipe. I know that all our ovens bake differently, but if you check your bread at the one hour mark, then 5 minute intervals after that, this bread won't over cook. At one hour it's still really wet inside, but it firms up really fast after that. Mine was done at 1 hour 10 minutes and was perfect. I hope that helps 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I tried 2 different recipes..I bought bananas and totally FORGOT i had them, so i had a bunch, and figured I could freeze some of the bread. This recipe is GREAT!! Another time i will use an extra banana and do half white sugar half brown. The other recipe I tried had all brown sugar and was also wonderful, but I'm thinking a mix of the 2 might be JUST right!!I always try a recipe as printed before making changes...so glad I did with this one!! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have made banana bread over the years and this is the best recipe I have ever tried. I need not look further. This is it!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Very tasty banana bread. I cut the sugar down to less than one cup. I will definitely make this again.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#It was decent. I think too much sugar for my taste
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#The BEST!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is one of the best. I cut back on the sugar to one cup. I did not have buttermilk so I used milk mixed with some lemon juice. I used pecans since I did not have walnuts. It was easy to prepare and came out perfect after 1 hour, 15 min. Will make this again soon. This one did not last long.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#In my opinion this is not the best ever banana bread. There is one in a Southern Living cookbook which is the best I have had.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Not only did I cut the sugar back to a cup, I also replaced 3/4 cup of the white flour with whole wheat flour and it still turned out wonderful!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#After 30yrs. of using the same banana bread recipe I've switched to this recipe. My daughters agree with me. This is the Best-Ever Banana Bread . Except for adding a teaspoon of banana flavoring we followed the recipe exactly.It was so quick & easy, I didn't even need the mixer. Only a measuring cup, bowl & wisk. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I always bake banana bread and its recipe is fool proof.I tried this recipe last night and I am sorry to say it was not a very good one ..it took 2 hours and still it was soggy.. So maybe if we put less buttermilk in it result might be different.. I like the taste of it tough. Nasira Mansoor
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Very good. Cut back on the sugar to 1 cup.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#My 2-1/2 year old granddaughter and I made this bread today (she loves dumping in the ingredients after I measure ). It was easy and moist and delicious. Made as directed except added some cinnamon. It made 4 mini loaves and baked for 35 minutes.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I thought this was very good and even better with a tsp of cinnamon added. will definitely make again.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I've made this recipe several times and it is EXCELLENT! On the 3rd morning after making it we had 4 slices left and I used them to make Banana Nut French Toast! Topped with powdered sugar and if you like, syrup! I also do this with carrot nut bread!! Give it a try! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I just made this banana bread and it is delicious! My honey likes a warm slice with butter on it. He kept asking for a piece before it cooled off. I will be making this bread over and over again.

Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Doubled the recipe and it came out very well. The best banana cake ever. Thank you!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Followed recipe to a T...set oven to 325 and baked for an hour...checked with toothpick method...left in for another 15 min as directed...bread came out hard as a rock...could not cut it with any knife in my kitchen...had to use hack saw to cut it...never again!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Best banana bread. Made it for my office. Did not think that the men would notice that I left out the walnuts. Believe me, the men sure did tell me the next time I made the bread I'm to add the walnuts. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is by far the best banana bread ever! I have made this for farmers market and it sold out right away each time. Moist, flavorful and wonderful taste. I will never use another recipe for banana bread!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have been making this bread formore than 15 years. I add a few handfuls of chocolate chips. It makes a 5 star a 6!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#We love this bread!!! With or without nuts it is wonderful.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is for sure the best -ever banana bread! It disappeared in one sitting ..... thank you for your recipe Gert.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#There are three people in my house, and this never lasts more than two days. It's wonderfully moist exactly as it is. I tried to use whole grain once (ONLY once) and it didn't rise nearly as well and it was a little drier. Also, I wait until the bananas are 4-5 days old and mushy and cut the sugar back by 1/4 cup. It's still just as sweet and it cuts out a few calories. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the best banana bread recipe! My mom gives me ripe bananas so she can get a loaf
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I used coconut oil and coconut milk and added coconut and cranberries. The best bread ever!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I took this bread to my church breakfast and it got rave reviews from everyone. i had many requests for the recipe It is very moist and delicious.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this per directions and its title fits the finished product. It is a keeper. Texture is great, very moist. I used black walnuts, but any nut of choice, or no nuts, would be just as good. The baking time stated is a bit long for my oven, I would suggest testing before the stated baking time. Mine baked in an hour. I always remove breads while still warm, not hot, allowing a bread to completely cool sometimes increases sticking. Cutting a piece of waxed paper the size of the pan bottom eliminates the risk of sticking, although I didn't do it this time and had no problems. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the most delicious recipe. For a change I will add 1 bag of chocolate chips.. I always replace 1/4 cup of sour cream for the buttermilk. It makes the bread very moist and flavorful.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I agree, this is a wonderful recipe, the buttermilk makes a big difference. My recipe is almost 30 years old, and uses a stick of oleo instead of oil, 1/2 cup of buttermilk and only 1 cup sugar. It never fails to please.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have tried many banana bread recipes. This one is just outstanding and the banana flavor is just awesome!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#The best banana bread i ever had....super moist!!!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#such a tastiest banana bread ever...... the best recipe and easy to make. Thanks TOH.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This really is the best banana bread I have made. It is delicious and easy to make. I'm getting rid of all of my old banana bread recipes. Thanks. I tried to give this 5 stars but it didn't happen. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#DELICIOUS!!!! I have been on the lookout for a really,really good banana bread recipe and this is it! Super easy and great texture. I didn't have walnuts but chopped almonds were just as good. You won't be sorry! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Great flavor and great texture! Will definitely make this one again when I want a banana nut bread. I used pecans instead of walnuts cuz that is what I keep in my freezer.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This has become my family's go-to recipe for banana bread! We all love the tremendous flavor! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the first time I used someone elses recipe and not my own that I have used for years. Flavor was OK but each one of my 8 little loafs all stuck to the bottom of the pan. I will be going back to my recipe. Sorry.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the best, best, best banana bread! I followed the recipe except I used coconut oil. And I added some unused chocolate chips. It did overflow in the 9in x 5in loaf pan so next time, I'll put some batter in muffin cups. The flavor was perfect. I made this last week and meant to save the recipe. Well, I forgot. So today I was searching the internet for over an hour trying to find the recipe. Finally, I used my internet history and found it! Thank you for this version. Very tasty. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the best banana bread I have ever made and the only recipe I will use from now on. I do admit that I have made a couple of changes (use melted unsalted butter instead of oil, reduced the sugar to 1 cup, increased the number of bananas to three, increased the buttermilk by another tbsp, added some cinnamon and left out the nuts), but the recipe also works well as written. I prefer to bake mine in a 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 pan for 1 hour and 10 minutes. Delicious!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I took the suggestion of one of the readers and used a toffee bar instead of the nuts. Wonderful flavor BUT even though the pan was sprayed the candy sunk to the bottom of it & I mean it STUCK! Most of it had to be soaked off. Next time I will do it without the toffee bar.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Wow! This banana bread really IS the best I've ever had! I'm not a big nut eater, so I changed those out for milk chocolate toffee bits. My family is doing backflips! ?? Just go ahead and double the recipe. You will definitely want an extra loaf, if just to share with another lucky family! Enjoy! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this, but may have made a mistake doubling the recipe (to accommodate my bounty of overripe bananas). I thought my pans were the right size, but one of the loaves ran over in the oven. And even though I greased the already non-stick pans, I couldn't get either loaf out of the pan intact. Having said that, the flavor was good, and I will try the recipe again and re-adjust my star level. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I reduced the sugar to 1 cup as per suggestions. I reduced the oil by half and replaced it with more banana and some applesauce. I also replaced almost all the flour with whole wheat flour. A healthier version that still tasted great - the kids loved it!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Great recipe, it is a bit sweeter than I would like. Since this is my husband's favorite I'm making it for the second time this week. I did add a dash of cinnamon. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Amazing! I added cinnamon and an extra banana. I am going to get mini loaf pans, and then double the recipe then make it. I will say how it goes!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#The whole Family loves this Bread! Outstanding recipe!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I read every review and then made my version. I added 1-tsp. cinnamon and nutmeg tothe flour. 1-cup sugar; 3-bananas; 1-stk. melted butter; 1-tsp banana extract. Baked it70-minutes. Goes without saying, this is absolutely the best ever banana bread. My husband loved it so much, before going to bed I sliced a piece, buttered it and left itfor him to toast next morning. Have bought more bananas to ripen for another loaf.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#It was okay, but to sweet for my taste.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is great and easy to make. I did add an extra banana which made it more moist but it is not needed. I also used 4 mini loaf pans and baked them 40 minutes. I have made other banana breads and this is my favorite.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Simply outstanding. I searched for a banana bread made with oil rather than butter, so this fit the bill. No mixer needed, just stir until blended and bake. I reduced sugar to 1 1/4 cups and substituted banana extract in place of vanilla. The combination of oil in place of butter and lower baking temperature yielded a tall, moist, and flavorful loaf.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#The whole family loves this bread as a breakfast item or a midnight snack. Sliced a half inch thick, toasted with a little butter it's heaven on a plate.I would have given 5 stars but I think 1.5 cups sugar is too much. Cut back on the pure cane a bit and this bread is a winner. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This banana bread truly is amazing! My husband and kids can't get enough of it. I always double the recipe so can make two loaves. I also use 6 bananas because I love the banana flavor and I leave out the walnuts. Wonderful recipe! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Having loved Bananas but about 6 or 7 years I find I have what I can only call an'allergy to any type of Raw Bananas', so after experimenting I know I can eat Dried Banana Chips and Banana Bread/Cakes. This recipe works for me, so, as I needed a super quick and easy recipe that works I found this one... BRILLIANT!! and though I'm not used to the US Electric Fahrenheit 325'F measure i just converted it to Centigrade 160-165'C (in the UK I would use a Gas Oven GAS MARK 3) . On with my version of the cake... As one of my son prefers chocolate cake and hubby always likes nuts of some type in his cake, I too added cinnamon & sliced my bananas to save extra washing up dishes but then added chocolate fondant, Walnuts and Cadbury's Drinking Chocolate (i reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup due to the sugar in the fondant (i had no chocolate in the cupboards) added a little milk (approx a quarter cup) and a drop more oil to keep the cake moist) it turned out fine, not quite as moist and squidgy as the usual banana chocolate cake you'd expect but whoever tasted it say its perfectly fine. RESULT... Everone's is happy and said basically what a'yummylishious!' cake. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have been making this recipe for years and years originally from the Taste of Home Magazine. It is the best banana bread recipe I have ever tried and is my staple one. Whenever I bring this in to work everyone swarms around it! Be sure your bananas are very ripe and it will make the bread moist and sweet! I've even tried it with some natural sugar substitutes and although the texture is a bit different it still tastes great. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#1#I am just starting to really experiment in the kitchen. I think I have a burnt thumb lol. I really wanted to try and make banana bread. I was scared and prepared to fail but this recipe was so easy...My boyfriend was very appreciative I used the suggestions of the extra banana and cinnamon...sooooo yummy and moist and delicious.. Will probably make again as soon as this loaf runs out..highly recommend this recipe to all beginners
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Solid recipe and one certainly worth keeping in your stash! We live in CO and I may have to tweak the recipe for our altitude, but the taste is certainly there. I made my loaves into muffins and added choc chips to half the muffins. Thanks for sharing!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Wow! Super, super good banana bread! All other banana bread recipes are now worthless. I did what some other reviews suggested and I added an extra banana (mine were on the smaller side anyway) and also a tsp of cinnamon to the dry mixture. I also didn't have any buttermilk so I made my own substitution (1/4 cup milk with 1-1/4 tsp of lemon juice, let it sit for 5-10 minutes). Next time I may add some mini-chocolate chips for a real dessert! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Threw out ALL the other banana bread recipes in my collection, this the BEST one ever! For variety, I added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips to satisfy the choco-aholic in me.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Best ever banana bread!!!! Its in the oven as we speak, second time I've made it in 2 weeks!! I do add a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and an extra banana. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Great and easy!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#wow!! amazing banana flavor ...very soft n moist...cant resist eating another piece :) this bread is awsome...definately a keeper ! used 3 bananas as suggested by other reviewers...thanks to all :) 3 do make a big diff. in taste...used a cup of brown sugar...n added a few blueberries just at top which made the bread look really pretty!! didnt sink in the batter even... baked in a foil loaf pan n a small pyrex dish......used baking powder as i only had it at hand....baking time was exact as recipe states....no added nuts cuz my kids r not a huge fan of nuts....will definately be making it again....though will use 1/3cup of oil next time just to chk if it still stays moist enough...its outside was crusty...n i liked it ! my neighbour did it too....her remarks were excellent thanks to TOH :) thumbs up! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#The flavor was good but I did find it a little too moist and left me feeling like it was too oily.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Really good recipe didn't have canola oil use vegetable oil and it was delicious! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Love this recipe! Make it all the time, really easy and tastes amazing. Also if you dont have butter milk just take some regular milk and vinegar, it makes the same thickness and doesnt taste any different. it's 1tbls vinegar to every cup of milk and set for 5 min while your mixing up everything else. so in a 1/4 cup of milk i would just put 1 tsp vinegar. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This stayed so moist, even after it cooled for days later. I followed it perfectly, but left out the nuts. This recipe is a keeper!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Made this today and it's been a family favorite for years :-) :-) 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Huge hit with the entire family!! We did cut the sugar back by 1/4 cup and will probably reduce it more next time. Like others we also add ed some cinnamon and nutmeg to suit our family's taste. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Thanks Domsmom827 for your suggestions!!! I used butter in place of oil and used part brown sugar part white sugar and it truly IS the BEST EVER banana bread!! I omitted the walnuts too. My husband never liked banana bread until I made this!!! Also I always had trouble with my bread baking all the way thru w/o becoming to done. Not anymore!! :D
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this yesterday and it's very good -- very moist and flavorful -- I used 3 bananas as suggested by others and it had a nice banana flavor. Mine took an extra 10 minutes of baking time, and thus, got a little dark, but that might be my old oven. I think next time, I will try substituting melted butter for the canola oil -- I prefer baking with butter. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#So moist and delicious!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Terrific, I cut down to 3/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar and next time will cut it even more... however; I, also, used melted butter because I did not have oil ..it was decadent.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I choose this recipe because it only needed 2 bananas for a loaf. I had 5 available and I wanted two loafs. This was such delicious banana bread. I didn't have buttermilk and just used regular milk too. I didn't have Canola oil, so I used vegetable oil. This is so moist and a lovely brown loaf when baked in metal pans. I loved the chewy texture to the ends of the loaf. All the kids agree, and want to keep eating it. Even my girl that doesn't like bananas loved it. Yeah! I will definitely make it again! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is TRULY THE BEST Banana Bread recipe I've tried; and I've tried a few. It is versatile and good just as it stands. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This recipe is fantastic! I've made it many times and wouldn't change a thing; except I usually use 3 bananas. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the only banana bread recipe I will make from now on. Great!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#OMG...this is the best banana bread ever! So very flavorful and moist. As suggested, I used 3 bananas and did not have buttermilk, so used whipped cream & few dollops of butter. I was contemplating adding the spices & brown sugar suggested in the other reviews, but do not want to alter such a perfect, yummy recipe.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is my favorite banana bread recipe.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Great, but not extraordinary.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Fantastic! I was even able to make this in a gluten free version for my fiancé who is gluten intolerant. Tasted amazing!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I'm not even a huge fan of banana bread, but this was just delicious. I left out the nuts since we didn't have them in the house. I will be saving this and using it as my standby for banana bread. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I will also only be using this recipe from now on. Finally a banana bread that is moist and that I can taste the banana in! Added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg and 3 bananas. Hubby says instead of trying to eat the banana's before they get overripe as usual, we'll purposefully leave them to brown just so we can have this bread as often as possible. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This banana bread deserves more than *10* stars. I use this recipe exclusively!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the best banana bread I've ever had, I made it for my family, friends, and church, they all rave about it. Last week I did an experiment, substituted home made cinnamon apple sauce for the bananas, came out really good, the people of my church really liked it. I just made a loaf, didn't have any buttermilk, so i melted 3 table spoons of butter added 2 table spoons of half and half. the loaf came out just as good. Great Reciepe. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Has anyone substituted applesauce for part of the oil? I would like to cut down on calories and fat but don't want to ruin the end result. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Love this recipe and have used it for years. It is quite sweet and could be just as good with less sugar. I cliped this recipe out of Taste of Home Mag. in 1991 issue. So, to deenadu, maybe allrecipes.com got it from Taste of Home. Don't be too quick to judge. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is a great recipe for banana bread. I love how it's crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#this recipe has been on allrecipes.com for years...not liking copycats!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#It was moist and good. My family loved it. We added a glaze that made it even better:Glaze for one loaf: 3/8 c. sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp melted butter, 1/8 c. orange juice (or lemon juice or grapefruit juice plus a little water) Mix. Poke holes and put on top of loaf.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I've been making this same recipe since the 1970's. I found it in a Bon Appetite magazine. Everyone who tries it, loves it! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Best banana bread I ever had!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#very nice,,,daisyh, try making mini loaves. That is what I do and cut the baking time down and they did not fall and they came out perfectly. I really love this recipe.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Really a nice recipe. My family cannot have nuts, so I sub in raisins instead.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Any suggestions would be appreciated ! I tried this twice today and both times it fell in the middle 10 minutes before the cook time was up. The oven thermometer holds steady at 325 degrees. I live at 7,000 ft but other breads I have tried have done fine.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Truly is the best banana bread I've had. Perfect texture and flavor. Only change was to substitute sour cream for the buttermilk. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#For a delicious gooey top, cover it with aluminum foil when it first comes out of the oven. This is a wonderful recipe!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#If I could give it six stars I would! This is definitely the BEST ever banana bread.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Can you believe the people who did not give 5 stars or even gave a review yet did not follow recipe directions. PEOPLE! If you don't follow recipe directions and change what is supposed to be done and it didn't turn out the way it was supposed to then don't rate low. Not recipe fault, your fault. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#The name of this recipe is spot on! It is the best ever banana bread and SO easy too! The outside has a wonderful crunch and the inside is so rich and flavorful! It is the only recipe I will use from now on!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have made this recipe twice now. Once with nuts and once without. It is by far the best banana bread I've ever had!!! (Shhhhh.....Don't tell my grandma) 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Best Banana bread I've every tasted. Definitely a keeper! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This Banana Nut Bread was the best I've tasted. I did add 3 bananas as other recommended. Definitely a keeper! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I've been using this recipe for years, yes, from Bon Appetite, and it never fails to get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I do use a little less sugar, 1 1/4 cups because I prefer it a little less sweet. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#this was excellent everyone loved it
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This really is the best banana bread I've ever tasted! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the best banana nut bread I've ever had! I love it!!! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Fabulous! Easy and delicious.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I used yougart instead of buttermilk and spiced it up with nutmeg and cinnamon. Delicious n moist!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I love how moist this banana bread it. We have this as a desert drizzled with honey. Sometimes I add chocolate chips or craisans. I've shared this recipe with all the bakers in my family. They all love it. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have made this recipe over 10 times. It is the best ever banana bread.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is a fantastic recipe...my kids are begging me to make it again!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This banana bread is just like its name Best ever Banana BRead I have had great complements on this recipe
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#The title says it all, it is the BEST EVER! The only thing I did different was to use raisins instead of walnuts. And I made it in my Breadman bread machine. It has a setting for batter breads. I am making it again tomorrow as soon as I buy more bananas!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I loved the recipe. I also changed a few things like used 3/4 of sugar and added mini chocolate chips and a teaspoon of nutmeg. I doesn't last long at my house. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I loved this recipe with a few variations due to my families preferences...I added 1 TBSP of Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp Nutmeg and a dash of cloves...plus I used brown sugar in place of the sugar. It stays moist and delicious to the very end (but it doesn't last long at our house). 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#We used my mother-in-law's wonderful recipe for 30 years, but after I tried this recipe I filed my old one away! My husband and all of my kids and their families say this is The Best Ever Banana Bread . 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Very good recipe. Would definitely make this again. Like other reviewers, I only added 1 cup of sugar and it was plenty. Also used 3 bananas instead of 2. Be sure to check for doneness before the amount of time called for. Mine only baked for 1 hour and 5 minutes. Ovens really vary!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is a great recipe! I make it as Muffins and add raisins and often call it breakfast! Thanks.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#HAVEN'T MADE I YET 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#HAVEN'T MADE I YET 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#HAVEN'T MADE I YETBUT IT LOOKS GOOD 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Excellent bread! I have tried many, many recipes over the years(my family LOVES bananas); needless to say this is truly the Best. Made it in 3 mini-loaf pans(of course had to adjust time due to small size of pans), and added another banana. It was delicious and easy! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#the BEST banana bread ever. i cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and add an extra banana plus chocolate chips
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Seriously the best banana bread I've ever made or had! Recipe as-is is wonderful. I've added 1/2 cup of Reese's peanut butter chips to the batter and it is absolutely crazy good!! I also divide mine into smaller pans and adjust cooking time and temperatures. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I hadn't thought about making banana bread before, but I have a large quantity of walnuts sent to me from my grandpa (who hand picked and shelled BUCKETS of them). I was excited to try this recipe based on the many awesome reviews & boy were they spot on! I did chop the nuts pretty small, as I don't really care for giant nuts in bread. Next time though I'll make an exception and leave them a bit bigger, by request of my dad who loves the walnuts and appreciates my grandpa's hard work! ;) I did leave three muffins without nuts just to see the difference and enjoyed them both ways. I followed a few suggestions from other bakers; I only put in a cup of sugar (3/4 regular and 1/4 brown), I put in three bananas and I added cinnamon (a lot because it's my favorite!) and I thought they came out great! I made regular size muffins and would love to figure out how to make a topping for them (maybe granola or something else to add a crunch or caramelized texture), I'm open to suggestions! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#My mother made wonderful banana bread, but when I tried this recipe, it really was the best ever banana bread I've ever tasted. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Made this without nuts for my Grandsons, EXCELLENT, can't wait to make it with the walnuts! This is delicious! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Made this banana bread tonight and it was fantastic. I made on substitution out of necessity. I didn't have buttermilk so I used sour cream. I have everything ready to bake another for work in the morning. This will definately be my keeper for banana bread. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this three weeks ago and added about alitle over a half cup of mini choc chips. OMG!!! This is the receipe I will ever use again. Fast , easy and delish, what more could you ask for.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I baked the bread at 350o F. instead of 325o F. I also baked the bread in two 8-1/2x4-1/2 loaf pans and used 3 bananas instead of 2! I baked this bread for 50 to 55 minutes. I was very pleased with the results! As I'd stated in my previous rating,I did make recipe adaptations-I used 1/2 cup each chopped, dried apricots and candied fruit. I just used 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. My second time around, I omittedthe walnuts and added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips + 1/8 cup all-purpose flour so the fruit wouldn't sink to bottom of the loaf! I prepared this bread again 12/31/13 & I used 3/4 cup candied fruit & 3/4 cup Raisin Bran Crunch Cereal instead of the nuts and chocolate chips! This recipe is definitely a keeper!Thank you, Gert Kaiser, for sharing this recipe! delowenstein 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I did make this bread twice already and I DIDmake SOME adaptations to suit my tastes!Thank you for sharing this recipe-it's GREAT!It's also quick! Dawn E. Lowenstein 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Excellent and easy to make. Truly best ever . Substituted walnuts with choco chips. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is indeed a wonderful banana bread recipe. My sister who hates bananas even had to admit that it was good! I did however read lots of reviews before making and I used only 1 cup of sugar. (1/2 brown & 1/2 gran. sugar) And because I did not have buttermilk, I substituted with sour cream as suggested. And likewise with the walnuts. I only had pecans. The 1st time I tried the recipe I used an 11 cup pyrex dish as I saw that it made a really big loaf. I started to moniter the baking process at approx. 1 hr and tested center with a toothpick. This time I doubled the recipe making the same adjustments as before, except I used only 3 bananas (only had that many) and baked in a 13 x 9. I also put a thin coat of cream cheese frosting. It was crispy around the edges, which made it taste even better. Moist cake textured bread. Definitely a keeper.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Wonderful flavor. I served it to my houseguests and they loved it. Took the recipe home with them.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this into muffins as it is hard for the two of us to get through a whole loaf of banana bread. We freeze some for later on 0 very sweet and like the idea of adding some cho. chips. - I also freeze whole banans if I can not get to baking right away - they work well after defrosting them.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Made these into muffins. Used 3 very ripe bananas and just a little more walnuts. We like walnuts. Cut back on the sugar to 1 cup. Wonderful flavor and very moist. My husband really likes these. Better then my old recipe. This is a keeper. Will be making these again.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Loved it so moist and flavorful..I also used 3 bananas.very good!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Made two batches, one with 1 cup of sugar and one with 1 1/2 cups, both were excellent.Baked for 60 min. Will make again.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This bread was terrible. Was hard to get out of the pan because it slightly .overflowed. Nothing but a gooey mess. Waste of ingredients
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Great taste, texture and sooo easy to make. This will become a staple at our house.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Made this bread exactly as it says, did not change any ingredients or measurements. But instead of using a 9 x 5 in. loaf pan, I divided the batter into 2 smaller pans as I find the middle cooks beter. This bread has amazing flavor. Next time I will add some milk chocolate chips.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#The flavor is excellent but like others, i must say that I coud not get the center done which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. I agree with the person who suggested baking it in two smaller loaves. The crusty top is a real plus.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#So simple to make & really delicious. I'm already thinking of making it again 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This really is the Best Ever banana bread I have ever made. I had to substitute the buttermilk and by accident I used baking powder instead of baking soda but it still turned out wonderful. Can't wait to make this again with the correct ingredients! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#For those who like a very sweet banana bread this is excellent. The only difference between this recipe and the one I've been making for years, is my recipe calls for 1/2 cup sugar & still excellent---just less sweet. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I would probably bake in two smaller pans as I thought it got a litte crusty on the outside in order to get the middle done.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Hey, this is my recipe! Found it in a cooking magazine back in the 70s. An absolute favorite with no substitutions.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the recipe that I as well have been making for years. I have used 3 bananas with great results. I also have switched sour cream for the buttermilk, great taste. I did not read all the reviews, but most of them. One thing I didn't see was anyone mentioning using this recipe and making mini muffins with it. Just make sure the nut, if using, as finely chopped. Bake for about 20 to 30 minutes...checking...Yum! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Nice texture; you can substitute all purpose flour with Pilsbury Banana Nut Quick bread.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Made this this morning. It smelled wonderful. Use Crisco to grease bottom and half way up sides of pan. Once cool wrap in plastic wrap and let sit for several hours. Moist but not real dense. I'll make again! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I added some cinnimon, allspice, & nutmeg and increased the bananas to 3. Excellent!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Best ever banana bread with a few changes; 1 cup granulated sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar and i cup of sour cream insted buttermilk
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the best banana bread. I make it all the time minus the walnuts. Delicious!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I had this recipe from an old friend of mine 20 years ago and have been making it since then. Best ever!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I make this all the time I do subsitute oil for butter, and I sometimes put in mini chocolate chips...Yummy!!! The best bread ever.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I just happened to have some over-ripe bananas on my counter when this came to my inbox today. :) Lucky me! I made this for my daughters (and I), and we were all humming MMMMMMM in unison as we sampled the still warm loaf. I would certainly make this again. I will also try a version as suggested by VirginaCA, and I appreciate her input very much. My hb is diabetic, and her version won't spike his sugar nearly as much as this one. Thank you for submitting your suggestions! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is an excellent recipe the results were great. I have to agree with marian08, make the recipe as printed, than rate it. When changes are to suit an individual taste, it is NOT rating the written recipe.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#@chocolate desert and marian08:Many of us have allergies, diabetes or other medical issues and food likes or dislikes in our families. For us, it's very helpful if someone shares the way they adapted a recipe. I sometimes look at a recipe that I think would be good but has ingredients I can't use for one or more of the reasons above. I don't always feel brave enough to try and make the changes myself since I don't always know what and how much to put in to replace things.When more experienced cooks try out the changes I need and share them, I am in their debt. There are many recipes I could never have tried without their help. While you may be recipe purists, please try to understand the limitations some of us live with when we are trying to expand out repertoire. It's pretty boring to eat the same things over and over because they are the only safe recipes you have. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Will try this recipe as is. Don't know how you can rate a recipe with five stars when you change the ingredients in the recipe. As for oven-time, we all are familiar with our own ovens and baking times 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#These are the changes I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat pastry flour, 5 tbsp Splenda Baking Blend and 3 tbsp Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, 1 egg, 2 egg whiites and 2 tbsp liquid egg substitute, 6 tbsp oil and 2 tbsp butter, 3 bananas, added 1 tsp cinnamon and used pecans instead of walnuts (my husband is allergic to them) and toasted the nuts first. My husband said it was the best banana bread I had ever made in 56 years of marriage. I made 3 recipes and baked it in 8 mini loaf pans for 40 minutes at 325 convection. Healthy & delicious!!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have a little hint for this recipe. This recipe is similar to mt mothers but if you mash the bskking soda in with the bananas the bananas foam and make the finish product no as dense.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is very similar to the recipe I got from my mom when I left home in 1974. As someone else stated, mine calls for butter rather than oil. If you don't use ripe bananas it won't turn out as well. The riper the better. Absolutely the Very Best Ever!!! I make a dozen loaves at Christmas every year and give them to friends who say they can't wait for the holidays to roll around for another. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is Best Ever Banana Bread . As others, the only thing I changed was that I reduced the sugar to one cup. one and one half cups was actually too sweet, and less sugar is better! Occasionally I will substitute half the white flour for wheat and it turns out just fine! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I got this recipe in your 2004 Best Holiday Recipes magazine. It is wonderful. I make it exactly by your recipe with the exception of the bake time, I bake it 1 hr 10 min. I have taken it to church many times and I get rave reviews. It's a keeper. . . . 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Been using this receipe for years I agree with the others this is the best receipe I have ever used for Banana Bread. Dee, NJ
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the same recipe I have used for years with one exception. I use butter instead of oil. I think it gives a better flavor and texture. I sometimes use 1/2 c sour cream in place of the buttermilk, because I almost always have sour cream, but sometimes don't have buttermilk. Both result in excellent flavor. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have been making banana bread for years, but this is amazing. I always freeze my old bananas so I always have bananas for bread. I also sometimes throw in some blueberries or cut up apples. Amazing....
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the exact recip I have used for over 40 years. I thought I was the only person who had this, as it was given to me by a lady who passed away about 35 years ago.I have always had a lot of compliments on this. I have been requested to make it many times for group gatherings. It makes happy to know that so many others also have the recipe. I know the recipe so well that I do not even have to look at the recipe when baking it. I will definitely continue to use this recipe, so yes, I would mmake it again.Thanks,Submitted By: Kathy Boltin
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I am surprised to see this. Years ago I revised a recipe and it is identical to this one except I use 1 cup of sugar. When I was working and we had pot luck lunches I was always asked to make my Banana Bread. I have given this recipe out many times. It is the best.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the first time I have ever written a review on anything, but when I saw this recipe come up for the Taste Of Home Recipe of the Day , I knew I had to write this. This IS the best banana bread recipe! Since I have found this one, it is the ONLY one I use. And I don't change a thing in the ingredients. It has the perfect texture, sweetness and its moist and when I make the two loaves this recipe makes, they're gone in two days. This is the recipe I give to my daughter and anyone else looking for a delicious banana bread recipe. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#My wife found this recipe in TOH several years ago. The name is right, it really is the BEST EVER! Depends on your oven on how long it needs to bake.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is by far, the best banana bread I have had. It's easy to make and I usually make a lot and freeze the loaves. I haven't altered the recipe but like a few of the changes that some have suggested (applesauce for oil and brown sugar). Thanks - I will try this. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#My tongue is still tingling from my first piece, fresh out of the oven. HOT and yummy!Pros- moist and baked through. I was really worried about putting it all in one pan, because I hate partially cooked banana bread. This was banana bread, not pudding, and I liked very much. Great flavor. However, I did cut back on the sugar (only 3/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup white) and substituted applesauce for oil. Didn't have buttermilk onhand so I just used milk and put some butter in for flavor. My dd and I are more than happy with the result.Raised up to a beautiful loaf of bread. I don't know if it helped that I whisked the banana and egg mixture with an electric beater to be sure I didn't have banana globs. I will continue to do that.Cons- considering how sweet it is, I would not follow the recipe sugar recommendation.Bake time for my loaf was too long, and I only had it in for 50 minutes. I was glad it was baked through, but if this had been for gifts, I would not have shared. The ends will be way too tough and overdone. It is very tough about a half to an inch around. If I would have gone the full 1 hr 20 minutes it would have been like a gummy bear.Overall, love it. Going back for my second slice now! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Kids loved it. The only thing I would do differently is bake it for less time. We baked it 1 hour and 10 minutes and it was still a little too brown.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this and brought it to a family reunion, and my sister couldn't stop eating it!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#The best banana bread I have ever tasted!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This banana bread is SOOO good!!! It's so moist and it tastes wonderful! I would definitely recommend anyone to make this, and this will be my regular recipe for banana bread! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I'm not fond of banana bread but this recipe is delicious! The bread was tender - neither too light nor too dense. Just perfect. I did make a few changes: 1/4 butter, melted + 1/4 cup vegetable oil (in place of the 1/2 cup canola oil) and used 1-1/4 cups sugar + 1/4 cup brown sugar, packed (in place of 1-1/2 cups sugar). The brown sugar gave it a nice darker color and a chewier crust- which I like. I used Jumbo eggs and Vanilla Bean Paste. Before I put it in the oven, I sprinkled chopped walnuts and clear sugar crystals on top of the batter. When it was done it looked beautiful and had a nice sweet crunch on top. I will definitely be making this again. Would make great muffins! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This recipe was great. I reduced sugar to 1 cup and it was plenty sweet enough.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Have been making this recipe for Christmas presents for at least 7 years along with others everyone loves this also make all through the year can never make enough.I make it in mini loaves this year about 50 loaves.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I'm not really a fan of banana bread but I had all the ingredients so I tried this one. It's amazing! Does anyone know if it freezes well? I'd like to keep a few loaves on hand. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#It was very good.. Just a little to sweet. I even added an extra banana but the sweetness took over it. I will however make again bur reduce sugar...
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#The best banana bread recipe I've made. It is excellent the way it is but I added another banana and it made it even more moist. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#5 Stars!!!I used 1/4 cup of melted butter and 1/4 cup canola oil. I always use melted butter in some form in my baked goods.I also only used one cup of sugar.A little baker's secret if you don't have ripe bananas on hand, use jars of banana baby food. I done this many times and no one can tell the difference. In fact guests always comment on how moist the bread is.I always have jars on hand. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Love this recipe, it's the best I ever had.I've made it around 10 times and shared the recipe with many! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#It is the best. Used only 1 cup sugar. That was enough. Will try the oil and apple sause suggestion next time.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Great banana bread, moist and easy to make. As suggested, I reduced the sugar by 1/2 c. and the loaf was plenty sweet enough. Didn't have walnuts on hand so used pecans. Found it tasted even better the day after baking. A keeper recipe! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the BEST banana bread recipe ive tried. My fiance never liked banana bread but him and my son eat it all up in a day! They both always ask for it!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Can't make enough of these. My six grandkids love them. I always make three at once. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I get asked to make this all of the time. I usually make muffins with it.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Very tasty recipe. We warmed up slices and had it for breakfast. Very good with coffee or milk.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This recipe looks awesome, and judging from the reviews, I think I wanna try it. We usually add chocolate chips and walnuts to our batches, so I hope it turns out!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the only recipe I ever use! And i dont tweek anything. It is awesome everytime and freezes very well. Excellent for gifts and all occasions. Love it!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have to agree. This is the best banana bread ever. I add honey and maple syrup instead of sugar. It is so good. My husband never liked banana bread because he said it was always dry, but not this one!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Great recipe! The buttermilk is what caught my eye, adds a great moistness. Have made it several times, but make it into muffins. Freeze them in packs of two, great to take to work for breakfast or mid-morning snack! Hint--freeze too ripe bananas in their skins in a zipper freezer bag. Take out one or two for a recipe, thaw for a few seconds in the microwave, pinch off the stem end and squeeze the banana right out of the skin!!

Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This really is the best banana bread I've ever made. I added a teaspoon of baking spice (cinnamon, cloves, ginger, nutmeg). I won't ever use another banana bread recipe again! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#The first time I made this for my mom and she loved it. My brother had some and loved it too. I just made some for myself and I added half a pack of banana cream pudding mix to make it even more moist and smooth. I love my revised version.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is a keeper recipe. All my family enjoyed it. I doubled the recipe and made two loaves, somehow missed the timer and thought I overbaked it. but the bread was still moist and delicous.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this recipe without the walnuts and baked it in my doughnut pan.I drizzled glazed on the doughnuts - they were stellar!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Will never use another Banana Bread recipe again! A family favorite!!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Nice texture, really moist and really tasty!I used a little less sugar as well and it wasjust wonderful. Will make again-
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This IS the best-ever banana bread. The only change I make is to subtract 1 t of buttermilk and add 1 t banana extract in its place, to get a little extra banana flavor. Everyone loves this banana bread.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#The very best Banana Bread. When I make it now I reduce the amount of sugar, and instead of all white flour I substitute 1 cup white flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour and it is even better with less calories.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I just found this recipe online after losing it for many years! I made this in 1993 and beyond for a few years and was devastated to lose it, probably in a move. It was so popular, I sold it at work and made muffins with it, and took it to many a potluck. I nearly had it memorized, but couldn't reconstruct it. Reading it now, each ingredient comes back to me. I reduced the sugar some, I recall. Thank you for posting it! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I just made this recipe again and some of it stuck to the glass pan. I just read a review that said to use shortening and not the spray. I will definitely do that next time. The card players should love this surprise treat. I would give it a 4 star rating this time.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#So good!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Reminds me of Grandma's Banana Nut Bread. Very moist and flavorful and makes the WHOLE house smell wonderful during baking - Freezes well also... DEFINATELY a KEEPER!!!! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I've made this 3 times in a week...after reading some of the other reviews, I cut oil to 1/4 c and used 1/4 applesauce. I also cut sugar back to 1 cup and never missed the 1/2 cup of sugar! Today's loaf came out delicious! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have made this bread for years. I found the recipe in Taste of Home magazine several years ago. I bring the banana bread to all family gathering. The little ones just love it. Most are from out of state so I make extra so they can take home. It is the best ever recipe for making banana bread.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Very, very good, but not the best I've ever made. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Very delicious! I have already shared with two other friends.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is much easier than most banana bread recipes because no mixer is needed. My husband thinks it's the best I ever made. I made 2 thinner loaves so it would bake more quickly, and that worked very well. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have made many, many banana bread recipes over the years. I will never make another recipe again -- this is the winner! I ran out of oil last time I made it so I put in 1/4 cup oil (instead of the 1/2) and then also added 1/4 cup applesauce...turned out perfectly. highly, highly recommend this recipe
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This was even better than my grandmother's recipe (God rest her soul). It was very moist and I love the buttermilk addition. I used dried buttermilk since I didn't have fresh. I added the dried buttermilk to the dry ingredients and included the liquid in the eggs, banana, oil and vanilla step. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This tastes good but I greased the pan and the bread would not come out of pan, so I lost the entire bottom of the bread.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I just discovered this recipe and agree it is the best one I have tried. I added cran-raisins & shredded coconut to my batch. I will try it with whole wheat & splenda nest time.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#OMGosh! This is THE best banana bread recipe ever! I made it for Christmas and it was a big hit. My husband and son are diabetics, so I used Splenda instead of sugar and no one knew. I will definitely make this again and again.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This bread was good and moist but very sweet. Too much sugar in this recipe in my opinion.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This recipe is wonderful! I have made this bread probably 7 or 8 times in the past few months. My family, visiting relatives, and myself included have given it rave reviews. Even the time I had the oven temp. too low and it turned out flat as a pancake, they still gobbled it all up!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#LOVE THIS!! first bite I took I said, wow this is the best Banana Bread I have ever eatten! and then I looked that the recipe and laughed because that was the name! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I added chocolate chips and the taste was INCREDIBLE.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is a really good banana bread recipe. Just a couple things that you need to know. The bake time at the top says 70 mins and in the recipe itself it says 1 hr 20 mins or until the tooth pick comes out clean. I have made this 3 times and it takes about 60 mins at the most at 325 degrees. Let the bread rest in the pan for 5-10 mins thing remove and cool on a cooling rack. The bottom tends to stick a little when using a spray so use shortening or butter to grease the pan.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made muffins! They're DELISH!!! Set the oven to 425 degrees and bake for 16-18 minutes. The mini-muffins took about 6-7 minutes. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#No buttermilk in the fridge so I made my own with milk and vinegar. I doubled the recipe and left out the nuts. I used a couple of silicon loaf pans and the edges of the bread were a little dark. I should have maybe knocked the temp down a little to compensate for the dark pan or checked it a little earlier for doneness. Overall though, the bread turned out very nicely. I have another 8 bananas on the brink so I'll make a couple more double batches and work out my flaws. I'll go get some buttermilk too as I would like to see how that would change the flavor. I imagine that this will be my go-to banana bread recipe in the future. thanks! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I am not a chocolate chip fan.....so I added cinnamon chips....we are huge cinnamon fans in this house!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this banana bread and have had numerous people ask for the recipe. Everyone agrees that this is the best banana bread they have ever eaten. I have made several to give at Christmas.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Very moist and tasty!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This really is the best ever! It lives up to its name. I put some chocolate chips in it and my husband loved it. I will make this over and over again
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this for the for the first time last night... it won't be the last. I used Splenda Baking Blend for the sugar and it turned out fantastic. YUM! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I followed this recipe to the T. I'm making this for thanksgiving, my husband has been bagging me to make him some banana bread I am a regular subscriber of Taste of Home I knew where to search for the best recipe.. thank u for help making my husband happy! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Delicious!!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#We've made this several times, and we love it!!! I've made it with powdered buttermilk when I didn't have actual buttermilk and didn't want to wait until I went to the store;) There was very little difference. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#AWESOME!!! I have been baking for 30 plus years and this is the best banana bread!My son stationed in Japan loves to bake and I will send him this recipe

Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Have had this recipe from one of your magazines for a long, long time. It's a family favorite...doesn't stay around long..it goes fast! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This was brought to me as muffins after a motorcycle accident. THEY ARE THE BEST!!! I add extra nuts and more bananas but they always turn out great!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have made this bread over and over again! I have changed a few things to make it healthier: I use whole wheat flour and only 3/4 c. sugar. I also use applesauce instead of oil and add 1/4 c. flax seed. It definately lives up to its name!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is a wonderful, simple recipe. However, the recipe does not call for the pan to be floured as well as greased. Mine stuck to the bottom of the pan, so in the future, I will either dust the pan with flour or use parchment paper.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Even more delish if you add chocolate chips! I've made this several times and everyone always raves over it! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#easy to make and delicious!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the absolute VERY VERY BEST of all banana bread recipes. It is to die for! Super moist and flavorful and quite addicting! So happy to have found this gem of a recipe!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#It was simply delicious!!! the taste of banana is very subtle
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Definitely lives up to its name! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out amazing.

Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This truly is the BEST EVER! It is easy to make and fantastic. It's a hit every time! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Great recipe! The buttermilk is what caught my eye, adds a great moistness. Have made it several times, but make it into muffins. Freeze them in packs of two, great to take to work for breakfast or mid-morning snack! Hint--freeze too ripe bananas in their skins in a zipper freezer bag. Take out one or two for a recipe, thaw for a few seconds in the microwave, pinch off the stem end and squeeze the banana right out of the skin!! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I had 6 bananas that needed to be used so I made 3 loaves. It turned out so good! All three loaves look beautiful. I did add 2/3 tsp of banana extract because I like a little more banana flavor than is usually in banana breads. I'm glad I came across this recipe because it's definatley a keeper. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This really is the Best Ever Banana Bread. I made this when the recipe was first published in Taste of Home 1992, and have made it ever since and given the recipe to many who tasted and loved it. Thank you for the good recipe.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I make this 5 batches at a time, or with a family of 6 I wouldn't get a slice at all! I make them & give them as birthday gifts for all my friends, everyone looks forward to their birthday, since the know they'll get a loaf! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I make this bread anytime there are ripe bananas on hand! The buttermilk makes this bread moist and flavorful.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#It is truly the best banan bread I have ever tasted.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Ethis recipEveryone loved this recipe when i made it for mothers day. It really is the Best Ever Banana Bread Cathleen Woodall of Flordia 
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#[Wow - what happened to all the reviews I saw here a week or 2 ago? There's only 1 review showing here now.] This IS the BEST banana bread - no kidding! Use 3 bananas to have an overflowing cupful. (I used an aluminum-colored loaf pan.) You will love it! -Lori in WI. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This bread is absolutely delicious! I agree with the title, it is the BEST EVER banana bread! I leave out the nuts and add a bit more banana, but other than that it's perfect as is :) 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have had this recipe since the 70's. It was in the Bon Appetite magazine. Excellent banana bread. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Made as written. It looked overcooked but tasted wonderful. Has a nice dark sugarery crust (is that a word?)
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Probably the best Banana Bread recipe I have found. My kids loved it and it was gone in a few hours! Aside from omitting the nuts I didn't change a thing in the recipe. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this today and its amazing! It is by far the best recipe I have tried, this is definitely a keep.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is hands down the best banana bread I have ever eaten or made. It is my new go-to recipe (since last year). I get many and often requests at church to bring it to any get-together and to make it for bakesales. Amazing!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I am always looking for a great banana bread recipe and I have found it. This was delicious and very moist. I used 3 bananas, added chocolate chips, and used milk and vinegar instead of the buttermilk. Will definitely be making this one again.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Very moist with a nice crunchy crust. I used 3 bananas and added chocolate chips. This was a very good combination. I substituted milk and vinegar for the buttermilk.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have a family favorite banana bread recipe which is probably still the ultimate favorite, however, this bread is excellent as well. And the reason I like it so much is that it is much lower in fat than the old family version. For having only 1/2 cup of oil, in what turns out to be a very large loaf, I thought this was an exceptionally moist and flavorful bread. I used 3 bananas instead of 2 since it was suggested by so many other reviewers. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly skipping only the nut since my family doesn't care for them. Mine actually tested done after 1 hr and 10 mins. The outer crust was slightly crunchy but not hard. Will definitely keep this recipe and make it again. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I often make this bread - it is so yummy. As in every bread I bake, I substitute applesauce for the oil and use about 1/2 the sugar. The last time I baked this, added white chocolate chips - that was really good.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this last night, and it truely is the best banana bread recipe ever. I did a few things differently. I added 3 bananas plus some cinammon. I didn't have any buttermilk, but I did pour in some organic soy milk. It was so moist on the inside and a nice texture on the outside. Will definitely pass around and make this again :) 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Super flavor! Moist and yummy:)
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#It was so good I made it twice in one night, I had to share this with others. So I made one for my daughters house.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is an amazing recipe! Probably the best banana bread I've had. My husband who doesn't even like banana bread very much liked this recipe. The outside is crunchy right after it comes out of the oven but then it softens after it cools so I didn't think it was too crispy at all. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#So, after reading all of the many raves about this, I thought for sure it would be better then the banana bread recipe that I already have. It was not. It was moist on the inside but way too hard on the outside. I did use lemon juice and milk instead of buttermilk and I just used 2 bananas like the recipe called for rather then the three that many of you recommended. Perhaps that is why, mine did not turn out so great.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#amazing!!!! seemed like the outside of mine was getting very dark, wile the middle was still a bit to moist? anyone know why that would be? I followed the recipe with no changes.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This banana bread is delicious. I never made banana bread before, but others I've tried have always been kind of dry. This one is so moist and wonderful. I used 3 bananas, powdered buttermilk, 1/2 cup each of nuts and choc. chips, and a touch of cinnamon. So good, very moist, and delicious. I'll make this again for sure. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#These disappear at my house with 3 kids. I did substitute sour cream for the buttermilk and made them as muffins cooking at 325 degrees for 25-30 minutes. They are a hit! I hate to admit it, but I even threw away the old family recipe for this one!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I forgot to mention - I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil :-)
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Incredible!!I had to make a few changes - I didn't have buttermilk, and ran out of vinegar and lemon juice to make buttermilk, so I used 1/4 cup of 1% milk and added 1 tbsp of orange juice to it - I also used 3 large bananas (so important that they are partially green, not completely ripe!) - and I also added 1/4 cup of ground flax seed as well. I also reduced the sugar from 1 1/2 cups to just 1 cup - although you could still reduce it more. I added a dash of nutmeg, a dash of ground cloves, and about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I really enjoyed reading everyone's reviews and suggestions too! It helped me with making my own changes - thanks for a great starting point with this recipe - it's a keeper! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Love it, Love it, Love it. I did the recommended 3 bananas. A true keeper.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I love to bake, but I had never made banana bread until Thanksgiving of 2010. It turned out awful. It wasn't sweet enough or have enough banana flavor to suit me. I didn't give up, I saw this recipe on your website and tried it. It is magnificent! My family loved it so much they wanted loafs for their Christmas gifts. I pretty much have to make it about every week now. My co-workers love it. My friends at church love it. It is truly the best ever banana bread, and easy to make. Thanks for publishing this recipe!! Kristine from Anthony, Kansas 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Baking my 4th loaf of the weekend right now! My kids say this is THE BEST banana bread I've ever made! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the best banana bread I've ever had, and it's so easy to make. Thanks for the recipe! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I make this without buttermilk. I add 4 bananas instead of three. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Really, truly delicious!I wanted to make banana bread for my house full of people at Christmas time, but I had misplaced my grandmother's tried and true recipe when we moved last summer. So I came to tasteofhome.com for a banana bread recipe to follow in a pinch. It was a hit!I especially love the fact that this recipe is made with vegetable oil rather than shortening (like grandma's recipe was), so I was able to avoid using the hydrogenated oils found in shortening. And I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I substituted an equal amount of milk with 1 T. white vinegar added, and it still came out perfect.Best banana bread I've ever made. :) 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I tried this recipe over the Christmas holiday as a brunch item for my guests. The bread disappeared quickly. They requested it as a must have for next year!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Sweet & moist
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#AMAZING! I want to try it with applesauce instead of oil next time. Very good, so glad I found this
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#i love this bread and so dose everyone i make it for the only thing i never have butter milk so i do the lemon juice trick or use sourcream butit is wounderful
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Wonderful bread!!!!! I added an extra half cup or so of banana because I used three very ripe bananas. It was exceptionally moist.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Amazing with chocolate chips!!!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I've been baking this banana bread (or as muffins) since it appeared in Country, October 1991. It is very moist and always delicious. Changes I've made over the years: use 1 c. white flour with 3/4 c. whole wheat flour; use buttermilk powder with water; use 3/4 c. grapenuts cereal instead of walnuts (gives it a bit of a crunch and some texture while being nut allergy-free. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Made this in a bundt pan and other then not baking for as long as in a bread pan, it came out very good! Easy and yummy!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the best banana bread recipe ever! Very moist and great banana flavor.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Delish!60 minutes for a dark pan. The kids added chocolate chips!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Love it! This is my new Banana Bread recipe that I will be using!! I used Half & Half instead of the Buttermilk it called for and it turned out GREAT.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this for my daughter's school's bake sale and it sold out fast. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I really is the best banana bread. I have made it over and over again. You can play around with it too an add to it.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#It was so yummy and easy to make. I added a few tablespoons of sour cream to the wet mixture to make it extra moist!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#made it in my 4 mini loafs pan, baked for an hour. YUMMY! yesterdays batch is gone, making a double today!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Wonderful taste, very easy recipe. Did not change the recipe at all. This is my new favorite banana bread recipe. Thanks.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I usually make this into muffins and add about 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips. I use 1 cup sugar, and substitute almost all the oil with unsweetened apple sauce. This recipe is very good.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This was the hands down best banana bread I have ever made. It was easy, and my family ate it all in one day and begged for more!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#So good! The best banana bread ever and good with or without nuts! Almost like banana cake without frosting.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have baked this bread many times over and got rave reviews from all who tried it! We always toast it in a toaster oven and then spread real butter over it! Wow..........the best!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This was really yummy! I didn't have walnuts so instead I chopped up some almonds that I had on hand. My husband loved it! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Made a lot of banana bread in my time and this is definitely my favorite and my family's favorite recipe! My family could not get enough of it so I will be making more again today! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#We really like this bread. I didn't have walnuts the last time so I used pecans instead. Yum. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I substituted applesauce for the oil in a small attempt to make this recipe healthier, but I think it made it chewy. I also didn't have any buttermilk, so I had to find a substitute for that as well. It's a good recipe and next time I'll make it with all the ingredients and no subs. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#WONDERFUL!!! I have several banana bread receipe's but this one is the best and I will throw the other ones away. The first one I made was sooo good that I made it again the next day, as it was all gone in a minute. It is soooo moist and tastey, and everyone raved about it. I will tell everyone about it and share my receipe with them. I can give it a 10 star. Thanks for sharing it with us. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#AMAZING!!! I made one loaf for my dad and then the rest of the family wanted more, so I ended up making 5 all together! These are incredible!!! :)
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I thought I had the best banana bread recipe until I made this one! It's great but I will use a little less sugar next time. Too sweet for my taste! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This was very good! I will definitely be making it again :)
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made three loaves at one time and in two days they were all gone!!! My family loves it and a neighbor asked for the recipe. I am waiting and watching for bananas to over ripen!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This was a great recipe! It was moist and very good. Since we didn't have buttermilk we just made buttermilk by putting a teaspoon if vinegar every cup of milk. Turned out great! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#this absolutely a keeper, I have made this several times
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#OMG! Yes this recipe is delicious, u can tell, look at the reviews. I made it and the whole pan was gone the same day, between my husband and 14yr old son. I'm baking another as we speak. I used 3 VERY RIPE bananas, it is DELICIOUS!!!!!!!! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I had my reservations, since once burned with a recipe stated as being the BEST and was not, but I tried it anyways and I'm so GLAD I did. I'm not a fantastic lover of banana bread but this one proved to be the exception. It truly is the best one that I've ever tasted and hubby said the same, with rating it to be a 10 in goodness. I exchanged white sugar for raw, organic cane sugar and used 1/4 cup less sugar. I also used organic bananas that were very ripe and organic eggs. This one definately go in my BEST foot recipe category. Yum...! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Just finished baking this for the very first time. I was so intrigued to bake it since it has so many great reviews. It came out great! Much better than other banana bread recipes I have tried. My picky 3-year-old daughter even loved it. It's definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I think this is the exact recipe I have made for 15 years. I did change it though. I use 4 overripe bananas and no buttermilk and add a bag of chocolate chips.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Excellent! I doubled the recipe and made two loaves, so I could give away one. The name of the recipe is true. Very moist, very good.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is my go to recipe for banana bread-turns out great every time!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this recipe on Sunday and it was great. My husband & I really enjoyed it, that I took made a double batch and gave some to my neighbor. It truly is the best. Yes I will be making this alot. I also ran out of the loaf pans so I made 12 muffins also. My husband really enjoyed taking them to work for his breakfast. The best and thank you for sharing the recepe.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I baked this bread for a friend and she absolutely loved it! I have not had the opportunity to bake me a loaf but, I will be sure to do so after the reviews it received from her! Smelled like an amazing bread!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Shared this recipe with my mom--she agrees that it beat grandma's & is our new family recipe. If grandma were around, she wouldn't mind since we discovered most of her secret recipes came from Taste of Home :) 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have tried many and this is my favourite by far! It did take about 20 min longer in the oven and I used pecans
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#wonderfully moist and tasty, I also substituted the oil with applesauce and added chocolate chips. Loved it, will definitely make again.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is the Best ever banana bread . I have tried many, many recipies and this one is tops. I receive many compliments and someone always wants the recipe! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I've discovered making one loaf of this wonderful bread is never enough. Soooo, I double recipe which yields three 8x4x2 inch loaves. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is a delicious recipe. I will definitely be making this again. The only substitute I made was replacing the walnuts for pecans. The result was successful and delicious. Thank you for sharing.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I have been making this Banana Bread since I first saw the recipe in 1992, and it is the Best Ever.Marilyn
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#I made this bread for Thanksgiving dinner everyone loved it. The only left overs taken home by my guest was the bread. 1 review stated that the bread stuck so I placed wax paper into the bottom of the pan. I did have 1 end that stuck but, I think this was my fault because, I left the nuts in half sizes which stuck to the side of the pan and pulled the bread apart when I tried to remove it. I will be cooking several loafs at Christmas to give away and I will use wax paper for the bottom and sides. 
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#I substitute butter for the oil. This has been a favorite for many years.
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#This is truly the best ever banana bread. Very crunchy crust.Lori
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Wonderful recipe! Best Banana Bread I've ever had---even better than my Grandmother's! Easy to make as well! I definitely recommend this recipe! Pam 
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Made this for the first time and it is delicious. New banana bread recipe for me !!
Best Ever Banana Bread#0#0#Best Ever Banana Bread is a favorite at our house. I always double the recipe since it goes so fast. I get 3 loaves from a double batch by baking them in 8 x 4 x 2.5 inch glass loaf pans. Oven temperatures may vary, so check them after an hour; generally mine take 1-1/4 hours.It's hard to resist having a slice fresh from the oven. Yum!! 
Best Ever Banana Bread#1#0#I've made this banana bread recipe so many times now that I have it memorized. It lives up to its name and really is the best ever banana bread I have tasted. All of my family agree. 
Cheeseburger Soup#4#5#This soup didn't remind me of a cheeseburger in any way shape or form. The potatoes just didn't seem to belong. I did like the cheesy broth and if I make it again, will leave out the potatoes and add either broccoli with bacon or macaroni. 
Cheeseburger Soup#2#3#Was just ok for us. We felt like it was missing flavor. Just needed something. Probably won't make again,
Cheeseburger Soup#4#0#I love this soup and have made it multiple times already! And it's so easy to make
Cheeseburger Soup#11#3#This recipe was highlighted in a recent Taste of Home email and I had to try it. It was excellent! The recipe was a bit high in sodium so I chose to use unsalted butter. I added mushrooms (as my preferred cheeseburger is a mushroom cheeseburger) and a bit of red pepper flakes for a little kick. A shoutout to the wife of James569 with the suggestion of a adding a bit of mustard to the bowl (just a skosh) and to cincibetty for suggesting doubling the hamburger. This recipe is destined for my next potluck. 
Cheeseburger Soup#12#0#I downloaded this recipe after recently receiving it in an email from Taste of Home.  I made it today and just love it.  My wife decided to add just a little yellow mustard to her bowl.  OMG! That's a much better Cheeseburger flavor. GREAT RECIPE. James, NM 
Cheeseburger Soup#7#0#This is the best soup recipe ever! Except, I double the hamburger. A friend, a vegetarian, leaves the hamburger out and she loves it that way. 
Cheeseburger Soup#14#3#I've make this soup countless of time. Food day at work this soup is always requested. I follow the recipe as written with the exception of adding what ever left over cheeses I have in the refrigerator along with the Velveeta. I am making this soup this week, instead of buying the 5#of potatoes, I'm going to try using the cubed hash brown potatoes from the freezer section at the grocery store. 
Cheeseburger Soup#9#3#This soup was excellent! It was my first time making a homemade soup, and it made me a star with my husband and our son! They loved it, and so did I. Wonderful flavor.
Cheeseburger Soup#1#20#I love this recipe but won't try . dont like the time it tales to cook. I;m disabled and limited to standing time. 
Cheeseburger Soup#21#5#So good!! I saved myself a pan though in the directions - after I transferred the cooked ground beef (I used a full pound and it was perfect) to a plate, I melted all of the butter called for in the same pan, sauteed the onions, carrots and celery and then sprinkled the flour over top after the veggies had softened. I mixed in the diced raw potatoes and the cooked ground beef and then poured in the chicken broth. It smelled so good while it was cooking!! Once the potatoes were cooked through, I added in the milk and I used shredded sharp cheddar instead of Velveeta, it is what I had on hand. I also left out the basil and the sour cream and I am glad I did - my whole family loved this and I will definitely be making it again! It came together so fast, a very hearty soup and so easy to make! Even without my changes, this would've been delicious, but I love how easy it is to alter it to your own tastes, you can't go wrong with this recipe. 
Cheeseburger Soup#14#2#The change I made was omitting celery and adding fresh red pepper in its place. We loved this!
Cheeseburger Soup#7#2#After seeing this recipe for years, I finally got around to making it yesterday, and I'm sorry to say, I'm kicking myself for not trying it much sooner! I didn't have whole milk, so I used 1 can of evaporated milk, and it was awesome! Best soup ever! 
Cheeseburger Soup#6#2#My kids absolutely love this recipe!
Cheeseburger Soup#11#11#I have made this delicious soup several times! Always very tasty! My husband loves it and ànyone who tastes it wants recipe! I think next I make I will add bacon crumbled. I made exactly what the recipe called for but forgot to add the sour cream this time but still good!! Thank you very much for sharing recipe! ??
Cheeseburger Soup#4#2#Loved this! I used mushroom broth and cheddar for my soup. Still turned out amazing and the hublet devoured it.
Cheeseburger Soup#36#1#Very good! To save using an extra pan, I did not divide the butter; I melted all of the butter to cook the vegetables in, then stirred in the flour to cook it - I then proceeded with the recipe as written.
Cheeseburger Soup#20#4#My two kids can be fairly picky eaters. They have recently decided they like cheeseburgers. I saw this soup recipe and thought Why not? Let's give this a try. Miracle of all miracles, they both liked the soup! Instead of garnishing with sour cream, we used a few spoonfuls of pickle relish because whenever my daughter orders a cheeseburger in a restaurant she orders it with pickles, extra pickles, and more extra pickles. 
Cheeseburger Soup#3#15#Recipe is good but the directions suck they lump three or four different steps into one step so you're constantly back and forth between ingredients and directions trying to remember where you're at 
Cheeseburger Soup#15#1#Made this for our Football Sunday in Snowy Upstate New York. Doubled it as I have 4 grown men, with some Texas toast. They all loved it, Guaranteed it will be done by the time the day is over. Thank you for a great recipe!!!
Cheeseburger Soup#9#2#I do a full lb of ground beef, but this is fantastic! Nice spin on potato soup with the change of the regular protein!
Cheeseburger Soup#3#14#Okay , but probably won't make again.
Cheeseburger Soup#31#11#I made this last night. And it was very good. Definitely making it again! I didn't use shredded Velveeta but had shredded cheddar cheese. Didn't whole milk but used 2%. And added a tsp or so of dill pickle relish to our servings and it made a huge difference in tasting more like a cheeseburger. 
Cheeseburger Soup#17#1#Comfort food supreme! No changes needed except salt and pepper preference! Nice, creamy rich soup!
Cheeseburger Soup#28#10#This is one of my family's favorite recipes. I've made it several times, as is with one added step. The addendum is I use an immersion blender to make the soup creamy. My one complaint is the recipe reads makes 8 servings (2 quarts). This recipe fills my 6 quart Dutch oven! Plenty of leftovers. 
Cheeseburger Soup#16#1#Made this for our neighbor that is stationed here! His wife would make this soup for him and since he was far from home , I made it for him! He loved it and so did the rest of our neighbors! Thank you!
Cheeseburger Soup#18#11#This was a very good soup. It was thick and cheesy with lots of veggies. Pretty much everything I could ask from a soup. I can see ways to adjust it for personal tastes with no problems. The only thing I didn't like was making the roux separately. But I will figure a way around that. 
Cheeseburger Soup#15#23#Good recipe, easy quick. I added smoked paprika, green peppers, garlic, thyme, used Velveeta, sharp cheddar, and cream cheese. I didn't make a roux as I didn't want it to thick, added some cornstarch and it was perfect. Topped w bacon. I will definitely make this again. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#3#delish!!! will keep it for a regular soup
Cheeseburger Soup#35#0#I see some reviews by the inevitable health nags. Well, all I can say is look at the number of reviews this recipe has - you're outvoted LOL! Made this and it was loved by youngsters and oldsters alike! 
Cheeseburger Soup#69#9#This looks delicious. If I want to make it in the slow cooker, are there anything different to do? And also, how long would it take to cook in the slow cooker?
Cheeseburger Soup#26#2#This is delicious! I usually make it a few times a month in the fall and winter as it is one of the few meals that everyone in my family will eat. I've adapted it a little to suit my family's tastes. I use a combination of sharp and mild cheddars instead of Velveeta, and I use a combination of peeled russet (all purpose) potatoes and unpeeled Yukon gold potatoes as I like the different textures. Sour cream is not something that I keep on hand, so I rarely add it in. We drink fat free milk, so I often use that instead of buying whole milk just for using in this recipe. To change things up from time to time, in place of ground beef, I've used both ground and link sausages (sliced thin) and cubed ham. I've also left the meat out altogether and doubled the potatoes. When using ground meat, I typically use a whole pound instead of a half pound. Any way I make it, we like to sprinkle some bacon on top! Enjoy!
Cheeseburger Soup#18#12#This was excellent! The only adjustments I made were to use cheddar instead of velveeta, and because my granddaughter just had braces put on, I blended it with an immersion blender before adding the milk and cheese. It isn't exactly PRETTY, but the flavor is phenomenal. 
Cheeseburger Soup#21#7#This is a delicious hearty soup. I could hear my husband telling my granddaughter that it smelled so good as I was cooking it. He was so primed to eat this. When my son got home my husband asked him if he was hungry or starving. One whiff of this soup and my son said Starving! Out of this big pot of soup all that is left is barely enough for one serving tomorrow. Highly recommend this! TY Joanie Shawhan for sharing this. TY TOH for posting this. Once more TOH delivers! 
Cheeseburger Soup#42#11#COULD CAULIFLOWER BE SUBSTITUTED FOR POTATOES TO MAKE MORE KETO FRIENDLY?
Cheeseburger Soup#10#0#Delicious. I added more beef, veggies and less potato. Very good.
Cheeseburger Soup#18#1#It's delicious, but as written this is more like a cheesy potato soup that happens to have a liiiiiittle bit of beef in it, too little for me to call it a cheeseburger soup. Next time I'll use a full pound of beef and maybe cut back on the potatoes some. 
Cheeseburger Soup#4#4#Very good! I'd seen the recipe many times, but always thought it sounded gross, judging by the name. After actually reading it I decided to give it a try. So glad I did. I added 32oz of chicken broth, we like our soup more brothy. I used 1lb of Velveeta, about 2 cups grated. It was plenty of cheese. I think more would have been too much. I also threw in a couple diced jalepenos. I'll add a couple more next time. My only complaint is the name of the recipe! 
Cheeseburger Soup#9#5#OUTSTANDING SOUP. REALLY GOOD! Made 2/3/21 with following modifications: Used combination of no sodium/low sodium chicken broth and 93% lean ground beef and extra sharp cheddar cheese. Also sauteed diced potatoes in separate pan before adding to soup. The consistency of this soup is perfect: somewhat thick and taste is superb. If you haven't tried it I highly recommend. 
Cheeseburger Soup#8#0#This is my family's all time favorite soup recipe and they request it multiple times each winter. I use leftover meatloaf to make it instead of ground beef. 
Cheeseburger Soup#5#3#I made half recipe for lunch today for 2 and all is gone. I forgot the sour cream and used fresh parsley and used the lesser amount of Velveeta. My non-soup loving husband liked this soup. I can see why it appeals to most people, but I like spicier soups. I also think the soup is thick enough with the potatoes that the flour slurry is not needed. A sharp Cheddar in lieu of the Velveeta might be an improvement.
Cheeseburger Soup#6#41#Just once I'd like to see one of these recipes serve fewer than an army. Maybe have one that serves two or three once and awhile. 
Cheeseburger Soup#4#0#Totally delicious!! This is our go to soup any time of year. I've shared this recipe with many family members. I do no change any of the ingredients. Obviously a family favorite! 
Cheeseburger Soup#3#0#Delicious and perfect for a cold winter afternoon! I heeded the comments...used 2x more beef, half as much potatoes, and shredded cheddar instead of Velveeta. Hubby bragged at work and I shared the recipe. Definitely making again!
Cheeseburger Soup#4#61#I made this recipe today and I would have to say it's nothing great. I did not add the potatoes and celery as these are not things I would typically expect in a cheeseburger soup, however I did add the carrots as it is nice to have some veggies in there. I also added macaroni so it wasn't just liquid cheese I was eating. I guess I just hate American cheese, it's very fake tasting and leaves a sticky coating in your mouth. I am going to try this recipe again with real cheddar and hopefully it comes out tastier.
Cheeseburger Soup#7#39#At a loss how this recipe became a contest winner....had better in a hobo camp
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#It took a while for me to get my husband to even try a spoon of this soup. He loved it. It is his most requested soup. Easy to make and easy too change up if desired. Definitely a keeper.
Cheeseburger Soup#3#1#I totally forgot the sour cream, but did add 2+ tsp Worchestershire sauce. That really enhanced the flavor! I also added some shredded cheese as the Velveeta is a little bland for this Wisconsinite. I did use fewer potatoes as one reviewer noted, and a little less broth as we line thicker soups.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#1#I recall making this soup back when I was first getting the Taste of Home annual recipe books! However, I'd used sliced carrots, potato CHUNKS, Cheddar cheese, milk, and instead of sour cream, I'd used Ranch dressing. I used 1 lb. of ground beef! (I'd checked my logbooks of reviews and I don't recall rating this recipe 12/13/2020!) 
Cheeseburger Soup#5#1#One of the absolute best soups I have made yet and I make soup every Sunday. No doubt this will be gone in the next few days. I added 5 cups of chicken broth instead, 2 cups of milk and I doubled the ground beef as others suggested. Turned out fantastic !
Cheeseburger Soup#6#0#Made this recipe for my mom and I on this cold December 5th night, and I can now add this soup recipe to my top 5 favorite soups. 10/10 ??
Cheeseburger Soup#2#0#Loved this recipe!!!! Huge hit . I mixed up the cheeses and it was amazing. Will make again. Absolutely love this soup. So easy and fillling ??????????
Cheeseburger Soup#1#1#Just made this for the first time and my family loved it. I omitted the carrots and added some jalapeno's to give it a little kick. I also used frozen potatoes which saved time. Doubled the batch and it's going fast! 
Cheeseburger Soup#3#21#Honestly....this was truly the grossest soup I've ever made and I was so excited
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#We really liked this soup, especially on a cold fall day. Next time I will double the beef and half the potatoes.
Cheeseburger Soup#1#3#First time making this. I used a can of cheddar cheese soup and 2% milk and just used a dollop of sour cream in the bowl if anyone wanted it. It didn't take long to make, was easy and we loved it.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This was a hit in our house. I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I would double the amount of meat and half the amount of potatoes. But even as is, everyone enjoyed it and the leftovers got eaten the next day for lunch.
Cheeseburger Soup#3#0#Made this twice now. Used one pound of ground beef, 2% milk, and shredded sharp cheddar cheese the second time and I think this made the flavor better.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is like the BEST soup. My family will request it every time they get. One year my son was having a pot luck day at school and insisted that he bring this soup. It was a BIG hit. I have added bacon for a change and added pepper jack cheese.
Cheeseburger Soup#12#1#Why do people rate something one star be ause they don't like the ingredients? 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Everyone in my family raves about this recipe. Even when I double the recipe, I rarely have many leftovers.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Absolutely delicious! I did tweak it a bit by adding 2 tsp ground mustard and 1/4 tsp cayenne, and since we don't eat Velveeta I substituted sharp cheddar. I will definitely make it again. Thanks! 
Cheeseburger Soup#12#0#First time I made this, I found the Velveeta made it a little thicker than I was expecting, so I made two adjustments kicking the beef up to a full pound and using 8 ounces of apple wood smoked gruyere cheese instead of the Velveeta. The end result was a submission to the food service at work's annual soup and chili contest with a first place win in the soup category and a rotating place on their menu for the past winter season. It was so popular that it has become a fixture on the menu every third Friday and almost a year later still always sells out!! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#3#Yum!! Mmm good!! I have been making this for about 8 years and it is always a winner when I make this. My friend you doesn't eat cheese looks forward to when I make it. Have never had anyone turn this away. It is a very hearty soup and fills you up. If you have any left it freezes well.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#We love cheeseburger soup! The potatoes and cheese make this very good.
Cheeseburger Soup#1#3#Definitely not a keeper for our house. Made exactly according to directions and our 2 year old pushed her bowl away saying No, thank you! Yuck!, the teenager tried two bites and decided on a sandwich, and the two adults ate it but said never again. Will stick to a traditional potato soup.
Cheeseburger Soup#9#0#We have been offering this for many years in our school concession stand. I think if we stopped, there'd be a riot! The commenters on this site have become more vicious over the years. If you don't like a recipe, then give it one star and move on.
Cheeseburger Soup#1#9#I don't mean any insult, but hamburgers do not have potatoes in them. There is a much better recipe on Food Network from Diners, drive-ins and Dives. Sorry. 
Cheeseburger Soup#3#25#For anyone who thinks this recipe looks good don't be deceived. For me, it looks like vomit and it tastes the same even substituting REAL cheese for that Velveeta plastic cheese. I'm sorry if I sound like a snob but Velveeta is for those who have no idea what real cheese. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#We LOVE this! My husband asks for this over and over so I usually make a double batch and we freeze containers for later.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is a KEEPER! Everyone in my family loved this soup, even my hesitant husband. I doubled the recipe and it turned out amazing. Shared it with friends and family and they also agree that it's a keeper. 
Cheeseburger Soup#2#1#I made this recipe for my husband and while already delicious, he had the genius idea of adding diced pickles to the soup. OH BOY that took the soup to the next level. The pickles made the soup taste like a cheeseburger in a bowl. SO GOOD!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is fantastic. I Increased the sour cream to1/2 cup and used the max amount velveeta suggested. Omg it was good
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#A family favorite around here. We substitute real cheese for velveeta, and that just increases the flavor!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Gads! How good is this! Forgot the sour creme, still awesomeness! I added some roasted garlic powder, and bacon for topping. House smells amazing, and the taste is incredible. Thank you.
Cheeseburger Soup#1#1#I made this hamburger soup and it was the best soup I have ever (and I do mean ever ) tasted. Forget the leftovers, there won't be any unless you double it and freeze some for later. 
Cheeseburger Soup#4#1#This is hands down our favorite soup! We have been making this recipe for a few years now, but we make it a tad bit different. We use sausage instead of ground beef and the flavor is absolutely amazing! We do everything else the same, except using the entire block of velveeta. We eat it with french bread and it's the best! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I've made this soup twice in the past 10 days! My family loves it. I added more meat for our liking. I used about 1.25 lbs of (very lean) ground beef. I increased the broth to 4 cups, the milk to 2 cups and used half a large (I think a 2 lb brick) container of Velveeta. Hubby suggested adding some bacon which sounds fabulous. 
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#Excited to make this, is there an alternative to Velveeta?
Cheeseburger Soup#1#1#I made this soup for dinner tonight and am very pleased at how it turned out! I followed the recipe ingredients exactly except I didn't thicken the soup with the flour mixture. I didn't use it because then my gluten free son in law can also eat it. It was still a very nice consistency. I also used half velveeta cheese and half Cooper sharp just because I already had some to use up. I also doubled the meat. It is delicious!
Cheeseburger Soup#1#2#This recipe is popular for very valid reasons. I doubled it and fed my family of 5, ages 55 to 12, some of them VERY picky eaters, and EVERYONE loved it. Even the leftovers were consumed. It is simple to make. The ingredients are readily available. I have to admit it isn't the healthiest dish I make. But every once in awhile, for us, consuming things like this in moderation is the key. For my family this fits the comfort food category. 
Cheeseburger Soup#1#6#I enjoy learning from other people who really can cook, unlike me, just following recipes. I have learned a lot from people who find a recipe and alter it before even trying it. I have tried to do that here. I substituted chicken for the beef, margarine for the butter, used a no-salt version of chicken broth, cornstarch for the flour, tofu for the Velveeta, skim milk instead of whole, did not add any salt, and used cultured buttermilk instead of sour cream. My family has decided that I can have it all to myself. It's their loss. Thank you for this recipe. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this tonight! I did change it up a little bit though! I omitted the carrots, and the roux used to thicken the soup. When a soup has lots of cheese like this one does a roux to thicken things isnt really necessary in my opinion. I added a little bit of dill weed as well, which gave it a little kick. My boyfriend had picked out a hickory smoked bourbon gouda that he decided he wasnt a fan of after I already sliced some for his lunch, so I threw that in there too! We're definitely going to be making it again :) 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Really enjoyed making this. I followed the recipe exactly as is and we are very happy with how well it turned out. We will be making this again . thank you for sharing your recipe.
Cheeseburger Soup#1#1#I've made this twice now. The first time according to recipe but used real WI cheese. Don't do celery because my daughter doesn't like it. The second time, I added more hamburger, a bit of minced garlic and a lot more grated sharp cheddar. We love it! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have made a version of this for years. It is a family favorite and I have served it to company and the also loved it. It's a fast and easy recipe to make and I always make e.ougj for leftovers 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#LOVE IT!! Pretty much followed the directions except I used the white queso Velveeta instead of the regular. My husband went back for 3rds! My daughter (who hates cheeseburgers) loved it and said that she wants it again and again. I'm from Wisconsin as well so this super cheesy soup is right up my ally! Thanks so much for sharing it with us Shawhan! 
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#This soup was so easy to make and I had most of the ingredients on hand. I changed a few things only because of what I had on hand. I used 1 pound of ground beef instead of a half pound. I used 3 cups of potatoes instead of 4 cups. And I used beef broth instead of chicken broth. I made bread bowls to serve the soup in. My husband, sister and 5 year old niece loved this soup.
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#I absolutely loved this soup. So easy to make and it contains ingredients I typically have on hand. I did use a full pound of ground beef but didn't change anything else. Delicious! 
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#I am not a big soup fan, but I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this soup! It takes a little time to prepare, but it is so very worth every minute!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this last night. It was so delicious that I had the leftover for brunch! The only thing I did differently was add a can of drained green beans to it because I didn't have any celery. Can't wait to make it again! 
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#This fantastic soup is a favorite of my whole family and anyone serve it to. A little labor intense but soo worth it.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My husband loved it. I think it could use an extra half pound of beef. The only thing I changed was adding paprika to the finished product. A bread bowl wouldve been nice to as it is very cheesey. Get the good cheese!
Cheeseburger Soup#1#1#Amer, maybe a more polite approach would have been better to let other's know you didn't care for this soup. Joanie, thank you for sharing your recipe. I wanted something quick, easy, a soup, and something that would use the 1lb of ground beef I had thawing in the refrigerator for dinner. My husband is on a low FODMAP diet per his GI Dr. So I omitted the onion as that's high in FODMAPs and I added half the Velvetta cheese and substituted the rest with Cheddar Cheese. I also used beef stock vs chicken stock to amp up the beefiness. My husband loved it 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My family absolutely loves this recipe!
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#Incredible soup! I cannot believe how good this is. I used leftover taco meat and something about those taco spices in the soup put this over the top!!!!!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#We love it, Thank you! I did make some adjustments... I only had shredded Mexican cheese on hand and beef broth so I used those instead of chicken broth and Velveeta. I also didn't add sour cream. My 4 kids from 13yrs-4yrs all loved it . We will make it again! Thank you! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#family favorite!!! i use a whole pound of ground beef.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#1#The best soup ever!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Love! Made a version for a soup contest and got 2nd. I would recommend sticking with the lower amount of Valveeta, adding a cup of pepper jack cheese, and adding nearly a cup of chicken broth.
Cheeseburger Soup#2#6#I was really excited to make this soup after reading all the great reviews. I have to agree with the one review I read that said it was basically Hamburger Helper without noodles. Actually, I think Hamburger Helper tastes better then this. The only change I made was to add a some bacon at the end. My husband and I did not care for this at all.
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#This soup is awesome. I made a few changes because my husband likes a heartier soup. I doubled the burger, added bacon and used beef broth instead of chicken broth. It came out amazing! This is a keeper!!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Made this recipe pretty much as written (except for no sour cream because I forgot to pick some up) even though I am not usually a fan of Velveeta. It was hearty and had a good, rich flavor that both my husband and I enjoyed. Definitely a keeper!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My family couldn't stop raving about this soup. I didn't have celery so I left it out. We will definitely make it again. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Loved this soup. The only thing different was I used chedder cheese and substituted noodles for the potatoes.
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#This cheeseburger soup is absolutely amazing. I first made this when my husband was doing chemo and radition treatments only thing he could eat even after his surgery he cant eat very well but this soup does the trick. I make it quite often and it jusy keeps getting better.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is a family favourite
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I love this soup! It's so cheesy and satisfying. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Loved it but used Cheddar instead of Velveeta.
Cheeseburger Soup#2#0#I love this soup; its one of my favourites. I substitute ground chicken or turkey for the ground beef and I add garlic. I have used different types of cheese, but the Velvetta works well. These are just my own personal preferences. Turns out great every time, no matter what type of cheese I use.
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#Made this for our soup supper at church and everyone loved it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Made this in the crockpot and it turned out delicious! Instead of velveeta cheese I just used what I had in the fridge, half a block of habanero cheese and about 1/3 a small jar of cheese wiz. Left out the sour cream.
Cheeseburger Soup#2#1#love this soup. use tater tots bake nice and crispy and then cut them up and add to soup. Also add 1 tbsp. of Ketchup, yellow mustard and dill relish. I use sharp cheddar and American to the soup instead of velvetta. Everyone I give it to raves about this soup. Secert a half tsp of worchershire sauce.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Delicious! Love it! Can it be frozen? I didn't think so. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#1/4 cup sour cream
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I was wondering if this soup can go in a crockpot?
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#Can anyone tell me how much sour cream? I've looked and can't find it in the list. I guess my seeing eye dog needs a seeing eye dog. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#It tastes amazing and I have made it for family dinner for about three times and my family has loved it every time.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My husband gave this 5 stars. I made a double recipe and I changed it a bit. It went against my cooking history to leave the ground beef with no seasoning, so I added a little garlic powder when frying and then a little salt after frying. Then I used cheddar cheese instead of Velveeta Cheese. Next time, I will use a cup or two more cheese. I will definitely be making this in the future.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This Recipe is RE- kick starting my LUV for soups..based upon what I just read.. My mouth is really watering for this ONE..
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Really enjoyed this, changed the cheese to cheddar and used 1% milk. Hubby really liked this. Will be definitely be making again.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Wow!!! I can see how this recipe got so many good reviews!! My neighbor made this soup and shared it with me. She followed the directions exactly ...... and I'm glad she did! I found this soup to me rich and flavorful with a nice consistency ...... and adding the sour cream at the end gives it a smooth and creamy texture. When I make this soup I just might add some cooked and crumbled bacon ..... other than that..... it's perfect!! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Made as directed. It was good, but not exceptional. I thought with all the 5 star reviews it would be better. Hubby loved it!
Cheeseburger Soup#3#11#This is the HIGHEST RATED recipe on the WHOLE SITE? Hamburger and potatoes swimming in processed cheese and loaded with calories, carbs, fat, and sodium? This looks like Hamburger Helper only someone forgot the pasta and threw in potato chunks. Ground beef swimming in melted processed cheese is the best of the best!?! I'm surprised the instructions didn't suggest dipping some mayonnaise on white bread sandwiches in it to complete the theme. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Not sure why I waited so long to make this...IT IS SO DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe as directed, but used a whole pound of ground beef, a whole diced onion and a little less than half of a large brick (2lb size) of Velveeta. I also didn't shred the Velveeta, but cubed it and it melted just fine. Added bacon crumbles for even more flavor. Will be adding this to my winter comfort food rotation...SOOOOO good!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup was a big hit in our house! I had 1 lb of ground beef, so I doubled the recipe. I only had 1-16oz. Velveeta cheese and approx. 6 slices of Kraft cheese slices, so I used that and thought that if I would have doubled the cheese, it may have been too cheesy for our liking. However, we did garnish our bowls with grated cheddar cheese. I can't believe this is the first time in my life that I've hat Cheeseburger Soup. Thanks, Taste of Home! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this as-is with the exception of cutting the carrots in to chunks, and adding a couple of cups of Colby Jack cheese along with the Velveeta. Along with some nice dinner rolls, this was delicious!!! This time I used the measurements listed. Next time I'm going to double it so I can throw some in the freezer!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have read a few things on how to shred a soft cheese like Velveeta. Can anyone here tell me what works best for them? Also to Edward - Maybe they have since fixed it, but Sour Cream is a listed ingredient.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I use some petite diced tomatoes too. As for Velveeta subs, no not a good idea but I do add some grated sharp cheddar in addition to but stir in at the end. I skipped the dried herbs as well.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#2#Made this today for the first time. Went a more keto friendly route and used turnips instead of potatoes. Came out amazing. I saw several comments asking if anyone has tried using a different cheese. I switched velveta for 1 cup sharp cheddar, 1 cup smoked cheddar, 1 cup smoked Gouda and 1 cup gruyere. I don't know how the velveta version tastes but this came out amazing!
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#I love this recipe. The flavor is delicious. To Madelyn below who wondered if anyone has used another cheese other than Velveeta. I did. I cubed up cheddar cheese. I did not like it as well. I didn't like the texture and the flavor was a little different. I am sticking with Velveeta. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Well it was -50c here in Canada and today felt like a soup day! So I chose this recipe. I've made this recipe a few times, it is a family favorite and the kids love it. This is the first time I've garnished it with pickle slices. It's even better with the pickles! We love this soup, thanks for the recipe!! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this a couple of weeks ago minus the celery and it was wonderful... even the husband liked it. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this for dinner. It was wonderful and tastes just like a cheeseburger!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Found the link to this in a Taste of Home email. I have been making this recipe for many years exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. I got this recipe out of a taste of home magazine before taste of home had a website. It is an absolute favorite of my families. If I even make it to having leftovers, everyone fights over who gets to have it in their lunch box the next day. One person asked if anyone has used anything other than Velveeta. If you mean name brand vs non name brand then yes I have. I have found that Velveeta has a much better flavor in the soup then the off brands that I have used. 
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#Hey Edward - go get your seeing-eye dog and have him read the recipe for you - sour cream is the last ingredient listed! This is a great recipe - soup is wonderful!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is very good. I cut up
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Has anyone used something other than Velveeta?
Cheeseburger Soup#0#1#it seems that recipes on the internet are getting sloppy. Why would you mention at the end to add the sour cream and yet it was never mentioned as an ingredient?
Cheeseburger Soup#0#1#Flexible! I skipped the carrots and celery cause I'm not a fan of those flavours and opted for mushrooms and broccoli instead. I used duck fat in lieu of butter and duck stock in lieu of chicken because that's what I have. I used whatever cheese was in my fridge: left over taco mix and cheddar. It was still delicious! I love a recipe that's easy to adapt. Thank you!
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#I love this soup! I like to add some chopped up dill pickle spears. Really makes it taste like a cheeseburger!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is amazing! We have leftovers in the frig right now. You can double easily for a crowd. I threw in a couple of handfuls of elbow macaroni, also. I got it from my daughter's friend, Jill. I sometimes pre-make the first part, waiting on adding the potatoes, until serving day. Most of the prep work is done that way and you bring up to a boil, throw in potatoes, finish with the cheese, milk, etc! Excellent!! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this for a girls/cousins get together yesterday. There was also chili, some spicy chicken taco soup and some corn chowder....this was the biggest hit
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#We've loved this soup! My husband who is not a soup fan raves over this recipe and he and our 12 year old will play fight for the leftovers! This makes a very generous helping. Oh it's even better the next couple days as leftovers. Warms up great! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is a great base for any type of cheese soup! I didn't have all of the vegetable ingredients to add, but I did have a bag of frozen broccoli, so I decided to mit the veggies in the recipe and instead make a Broccoli and cheese hamburger soup! It really was delicious and made plenty for everyone! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Always enough to share with somone else!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My family absolutely loves this soup! Perfect for cold winter days. It's very hearty and filling. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#The broth was excellent, but it seemed more like a cheesy potato soup than cheeseburger. We'll enjoy this soup anyway, and I'll make this again, but next time I'll double the meat and cut back on the potatoes to make it more'cheeseburgery'
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Great recipe! The ingredients in this soup work together perfectly! The carrots, onions, and celery are what give the soup a great flavor -- but still I made a couple of my own changes ...I'm not a Velveeta fan so I used even amounts of cheddar and american cheese (any combination of cheeses you like would work) -- I used a pound of ground beef and as someone suggested I added just a splash of Worcestershire sauce -- This delicious recipe is a keeper! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#The best recipe for this soup love it
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I found this to be a bit on the heavy side for a soup. It had more of a stew look. But it was very tasty and made for a filling soup.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Try thickening soup with mashed potato flakes instead if flour. Thats how I thicken my potato soup and cream of broccoli soup and this one! I always keep an extra pouch or box of mashed potatoes for this . Then there is no flour taste.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This has become my families favorite soup. I did switch up the cheese mix a little. I used some Gruyere and aged Gouda along with Chedder and some shredded american cheese (it melts so well). I've made it three times and I have never had leftovers. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Made this for the first time last week and it was absolutely delicious!! I doubled the recipe and it was gone in no time. I can't wait to take it to our next soup supper at my church. I will make sure to have copies of the recipe with me, as I am sure that there will be many requests for it. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Great recipe, but I think the skewers are a miss. I get the pickle and onion connection, but not this way.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I added a little relish...made it even more like a cheeseburger
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#I have been making this very versatile recipe for a couple decades. My favorite version is replacing the potatoes with cauliflower pulled apart in similar size pieces with the stems cut up also, I chop up fresh parsley(1/4 to 1/2 cup), real cheddar instead of Velveeta, replace burger with cubed ham but just as good without meat at all.
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#So full of flavor! I double the amount of cheese, onions and hamburger...
Cheeseburger Soup#1#2#Adding the given 3/4 t of salt is crazy!!!! In just the Velveeta & 3 cups of the lowest sodium chicken broth, there is at least 7500 mg. of sodium. *smh*
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Absolutely delicious!!! Perfect snow day recipe.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is one of our favorite soups. So delicious! And if there are any leftovers, they are just as good if not better than the first time around!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is one of our favorites! I make it often in the winter. If there are any leftovers, which is rare, I put it in individual servings in the freezer for a quick lunch. The only change I make is that I add a full pound of hamburger. The carrots, onions, and celery give the soup a great flavor. I thought the basil was different, but it is excellent in the soup. The amount of cheese is just right, as it is not overly cheesy. I will definitely keep making this soup!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This was a terrific dish. My entire family LOVED it. I used full pound of hamburger instead of 1/2 pound. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I loved it. Only used half the cheese and 2% milk.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have been making this soup since it was first published in 1996. The only changes I make are to use a full pound of ground beef, and American cheese rather than Velveeta. I also sometimes add more chicken broth to thin it out a bit. Definite winner for my husband.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I used a full pound of ground beef and no Velvetta...cheddar cheese and 1/4 c. cream cheese instead. It seemed to lack flavor until I added a pinch of red pepper flakes, some Worcestershire sauce and a good teaspoon of bacon grease. I know, I know...but it needed something. After those were added, it tasted great. The next time I'll saute the vegetables in a bit of bacon grease and/or crumble some cooked bacon on the top. Who doesn't love a bacon cheeseburger? 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Excellent! Both my guys (hubby and Dad) liked it !!I used almond milk and added a bit of shedded cheddar as I was a bit short on Velveeta.Will definitely make again.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#The soup went over well with the family. The only changes I would make would be to use the full pound of hamburger and change the ratio of butter to flour to make the roux. The recipe's directions made a thick dry paste. I could actually taste the flour in the soup. So, when I make this again I will use 4 Tbsp of butter to 1/4 cup flour. I may need to tweek it a little so the roux is pourable instead of a lumpy paste. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#A staple in our home. Freezes well and everyone loves it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This was okay. It is very heavy and I won't make it again. It tastes like a bowl of queso. 
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#I used this recipe as a guide. I had to remove the carrots as some of family do not like cooked carrots, so I added corn instead. I also added a tsp of Worcestershire sauce and 1/8 cup of red wine, The alcohol cooks out leaving more of a rich flavor to the meat.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My family loved this soup! It was very filling and easy to put together. I used the frozen cubed hash brown potatoes which was a huge time saver. I too used beef broth and two cans cheddar soup since it was what I had on hand instead of velveeta.Quick, easy, and delicious!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I used Gluten Free All Purpose Flour to make it gluten free for my son. Also used 2% milk Velveeta. It was delicious! Very thick and filling.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Since I live alone, this makes a more soup than I can use at once. I didn't like it frozen. I have found that if I make the base(NOT THE CHEESE) and freeze it into 2 or 3 bowls, I can then just thaw one of these, and add the cheese then. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My friend shared this recipe with me a decade ago and it is still a family favorite. It is now a football favorite too! I make this to sell at our concession stand. It always sells out.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#As we prepared to spend the last part of a frigid Christmas Day watching our Steelers and Eagles play, I wanted something comforting and easy for dinner and this was IT! Absolutely delicious. Only adaptation I made was using beef broth instead of chicken broth because that is what I had on hand. This has already been added to my recipe blog.
Cheeseburger Soup#1#1#Why do people review recipes if they modify the ingredients or don't do white flour or Velveeta?' 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My family loved this soup, easy to prepared, the soup was full bodied, creamy and delicious. I normally do not use Velveeta in anything, but in this soup, it was perfect.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#1#A pretty good recipe, but I thought it needed some help. The mirepoix makes a real difference to the full flavor of the soup, but I did not care for their noticable presence in the finished product. Solution, I pureed them once fully cooked with 1 cup of beef broth. That is a second change I made, beef not chicken broth for all of the obvious reasons. For me, a cheesebuger always includes sliced tomato, so that brought me to my third modification - 1 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes with juices. My fourth change was to use a full pound of ground beef. I also used the pan drippings to cook the mirepoix which contributes greatly to the meaty flavor of the soup. To keep the cooked ground beef moist & tender, I did not return it to the pot until the potatoes were almost done. The mirepox puree eliminates the need for the roux to thicken the soup. I used the combination of the puree and the starch from the cooked potatoes to create a creamy base for the soup as the cheese melted. Rather than Velveeta, which contributes too much salt to the soup, I used 4 ounces of cream cheese and 12 ounces of sharp cheddar (use the cheese you best like on you cheeseburger). The cream cheese also helps with the emulsification of the sauce, and made the sour cream unnecessary. I finished with salt & pepper to taste along with a generous 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard. After all what is a cheeseburger without ketchup (the tomatoes) and mustard? While I made a number of changes that I prefer to this soup, I would not have thought of a cheeseburger soup with out this for inspiration.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Used small red potatoes, added and extra cup of broth, doubled the meat to 1 lb, and left off the carrots. Super yummy!!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#The best cheeseburger soup ever!! I substituted homemade Velveeta for store-bought and white whole-wheat flour for the AP. My bunch demolished the entire pot so next time I'll double the recipe. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Sabrossimo!
Cheeseburger Soup#1#5#Sorry taste of home,don't do white flour or Velveeta,YUK!!! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#2#YIKES 450 calories and 33 grams of carbs? Looks great but unhealthy as all get out
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#The best cheese burger soup ever! My family loves it.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Yummy.....I am a single senior lady so I cut it in half. then I froze the rest for 2 more meals. I also substituted White cheddar and Mozarella instead of Velveta.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Absolutely love this recipe. So quick and easy to make. YUMMMMMMMYYYYY
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My kids loved this soup! I have to admit though, I did take a shortcut to make this a meal I could whip up after work. I substituted the prep work and cooking veggies with two cans of Veg-All. It was really good!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Family loved the recipe and I served it in the Bread bowls from this site. Thank you for sharing. We used reall cheese instead of the Velveeta.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I read Williams review which suggested, his was better. What is wrong with him to be so childish and mean spirited? . Made the soup for my husband last night and he loved it. Not exactly the healthiest soup, but definitely a crowd pleaser for kids and grown men!! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Love this soup and do share the recipe with everyone I serve it to. I find it's a great way to use up leftover pot roast. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#We loved this. I added a few dashes of Texas Pete hot sauce to give it a little more pizazze, but otherwise made as directed. Will save and make again.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I followed the recipe as written. It was delicious ! A new family favorite.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I've been making this soup for over 10 years. It's delicious! But my original recipe I printed from this website calls for 8 oz of Velveeta. I think when it's made with more Velveeta it tastes grainy. I also always use 1-1 1/2 lb of ground beef. Usually I'm cooking for a large crowd so it goes farther. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have been making this for years and have received many compliments and requests for the recipe!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Just made this tonight.I'm writing this between bites of my second bowl.The empty bowls from the kids says it all. Delicious. Period. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I make this with cheddar not velveeta.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#A favorite in our house! I have been making it for years. If I bring it somewhere, I have to share the recipe. It's a keeper! I sub out a little of the cheese for a spicy cheese such as pepper jack or hot habanero and add a little bacon. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Made it for a gathering and received rave reviews from everyone!
Cheeseburger Soup#1#5#I've been making Cheeseburger CHOWDER for 20 years my recipe is better...but nice attempt lol Velveeta 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I make quantities of this recipe & freeze for Me & Gifts...that's how good it is! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Made this for supper tonight and it was delicious!! I plan on sharing this recipe with my grown daughters. I know my son-in-law will love it!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Can you make this cheeseburger soup in a crockpot ?
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#A new family favorite!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My family and I love this recipe so much I have shared it with my older sister and her granddaughter said that it was from Heaven. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is by far one of the most delicious soups I have made. I didn't have velvetta cheese so used cheese whiz. The sour cream makes the soup. Adds a nice finish to the already great soup. I will make this often. More of a meal than just a soup. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My husband and I loved this soup. I did make some adjustments though. I only put in 2 cups of potatoes instead of 4, and 8 oz. of cheese instead of 16. Excellent taste.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this the other day and my whole family loved it. Thank you for sharing it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I added bacon
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Definite Keeper!!! My family loved this soup and it will be made again.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#1#I'm gonna make this again, but DEFINITELY with adjustments. No celery! It's extremely distracting. I'll also be adding chopped pickles. I've had another cheeseburger soup recipe that had them and it was DELICIOUS! Who knew, right?! Leave out the basil. It makes this taste like a spaghetti sauce gone wrong. Lastly, a whole pound of Velveeta? Really?! I'd cut that to about 1/4 of that! Garnish with Cheddar if ya want more cheese. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this soup and it is yummy!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made a double batch and my husband and I loved it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is great soup. It has everything in it my husband loves and he requests it over and over.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#1#Just okay. Too much cheese, and I even added plenty of extra broth.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#1#We aren't super fans of Velveeta so it wasn't our favorite recipe. Fun to try though 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#1#Very delicious and rich and creamy did a few changes just because worked with what i had but still a very awesome succulent soup 4 stars ??
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Excellent!! The only change I made was substituted 8oz. Sharp cheddar cheese with 8oz Velveeta instead of all 16oz Velveeta. This one is a keeper.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Delicious! I upped the broth since some thought it was too cheesy.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Really loved this soup! Definitely appeals to our meat-and-potato eaters.I substituted cheddar and other cheeses we had on hand for the Velveeta and added it a bit at a time. Adding a bit of cream in with the milk gave it a nice, rich feel.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#We loved this soup. Great soup for kids cuz what kid doesn't love a cheeseburger? This is just a cheeseburger in a soup! I did cut the cheese in half! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is absolutely delicious! My husband can't wait for me to make it again! 
Cheeseburger Soup#1#2#I didn't like this at all. Way to much cheese. I wish I would have followed my first thought of only adding half the cheese. I gave some to my neighbors and they too felt the same way. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I took this to a family soup potluck. It was a real hit. All I took home was the empty crockpot.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is simply delicious! I served it with homemade rolls and my family loved it. Definitely to be repeated!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I added sliced mushrooms and a zesty red pepper. DELICIOUS!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This recipe is definitely one of my FAVORITE comfort foods! Always a hit for dinner.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this on a Sat. for 8 people. 19 yr. old grandson that doesn't eat veggies. ask if it had carrots in it! He went back for seconds and ask on Sun. if there was any left that he could have for supper on Mon. night. I didn't have basil or parsley so left out. Used 8 oz. shredded Mexican chees and 8 oz. shredded co jack instead of Velveeta. will be making this a lot this winter. I used a full pound of hamb. On Mon. I added a pint of home canned potato soup mix, a little more cheese and sour cream so we could have three bowls. Potato soup mix is: in a pint jar put 1/2 pint jar chopped potatoes, 1/4 pint sliced carrots, split the rest of the jar with a layer of chopped celery and chopped onions. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and fill with water. Pressure can at 10 pounds for 20 minutes. This makes a pretty jar for a gift also. Put the instructions on it.To use heat soup mix with 1 Tablespoon butter or marg. and add one pint milk, check the salt and add pepper if you like. Heat but don't boil. If you need quarts just use the same proportions in a qt. jar with 1 teaspoon of salt and pressure at 10 lbs. for 25 minutes. You can also can just can potatoes or add onions to the potatoes for the same amount of time. These are handy to fry or add to soup. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Very good soup and I will use the whole pound of ground beef and another 1/2 lb of Velvetta or other cheese that I may have on hand the next time around.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is excellent. It's quick and easy and very creamy. Will definitely make this again. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is the best soup I have ever made.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I don't use the bouillon cubes but something called better than broth. It's a paste that has way more flavor and less sodium. A tablespoon is enough to flavor about 5 cups of water with a real chicken flavor 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is absolutely delicious and one of our family favorites. I do tweak this recipe to my family's taste. I also made this soup in our church kitchen for Wednesday night dinners and for special occasions serving our visiting ministers and it was definitely a thumbs up. I highly recommend this recipe. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#just made this.....it is super delish. made few add- ins/changes: added a chicken bouillon (sp) cube and only 1/2 tsp sea salt, used 10 oz extra sharp white cheddar which I grated (only had 10 oz in fridge), plus I used 3/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup heavy cream. crumbled bacon on top and added croutons. my hubby added swirl of ketchup and chopped pickles. so good. people that made this and say it has no flavor, put a bouillon cube in there. every soup I make I add a cube. I don't understand why ppl don't cook more with it, it adds flavor! just cut back on the salt that recipe calls for. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Love - Love - Love this soup!!! My family enjoys it as a meal - very hearty. Don't let the use of Velveta scare you, it really works well. The recipe is wonderful as written, however I occasionally change things up for a slightly different taste. My favourite is simply adding 1lb of ground beef (instead of 1/2 a lb) and a little Cajun Seasoning (Tony Chacheres). Or a can of Rotel Tomatoes for Queso Dip flavour (kids really liked this). 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#So good I made homemade bread bowls to go with, this recipe knocks it out of the park! Love it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#1#Delicious! Even the kids love it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Making this for the 2nd time!! I switch things around though for my family. I use 2 lbs ground beef, garlic instead of onion, turkey broth instead of chicken. I also diced 2 green peppers. My taters are gold ones and smaller so I peeled diced 6. Topped with diced bacon before serving-adds a smoky flavor.We use this as a dip soup!! Mmm the best with scoop chips. I make for supper main night then put leftovers in qt canning jars.Hubs had this at a truck stop one time and says mine is hands down the best soup ever!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Made this tonight and it was delish. Changed it by using a can of evaporated milk instead of the regular milk, used just over a pound of hamburger, 2 cans of chicken broth, 2 cups of shredded cheddar and 1 cup velveeta, and did not use the flour thickener. It was very tasty and hearty. Will make again.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Excellent! We added some more velveeta and it was cheesy and awesome! Will definitely make it again.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Excellent! It's a meal in a bowl. i used a pound of ground beef. Makes it a heartier soup. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is rich and delicious. This is the second time I've made this recipe and I have made a couple of additions. I use a pound of hamburger which is perfect for my family. We like a punch of flavor so I add a can of Rotel. I use the emersion blender and all it does is add flavor and it doesn't change the color. I fried some bacon and we added it as a garnish. Delicious! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Wonderful!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have been making this soup since I first saw the it in your magazine. This is one of our family's favorites. I do add extra ground beef and double the recipe now as my family has grown over the years. I like to serve it with homemade bread bowls. I am making it again today. Thanks for the recipe. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Tastes like a grilled Cheeseburger. Different & easy, good over egg noodles. The potatoes seemed strange at first, but then they blended in & reminded me of burger & fries. I tweaked it. Tripled the beef & added better than boullion beef flavor, a cup each of veggies, bumped up the spices, Campbells beef consomm? & French onion soup plus two cans of water. Left the potato amount the same & added more cheese. Left out the sour cream since it tasted good as is. All you need is crusty bread & a pickle!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Really yummy!! I used 1 lb. of ground beef to make it more filling. Will definitely make again.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is amazing. Very easy to make. I made mine exactly as the recipe called for.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Four stars ONLY because it didn't seem to turn out quite like the others said. Probably my fault. However...I will definitely make it again because the husband really enjoyed it and I think I know what I did wrong. Hopefully. :) Also...didn't change ANYTHING. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Made this last night--was a hit. Even my husband, who is not a soup fan, said it was good. Will make again. Could use more meat. I skipped the sour cream. Might try tomatoes next time, as others suggested.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#made the soup with a few modifications,. I used 1.6lbs. Of ground beef, 2_cartons of chicken broth, 1cup of milk, and half cup of heavy cream. This is the best soup that I have ever eaten, and my family loved it.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I make this soup in large batches an everyone raves about It and ask for the recipe. It freezes well so I always have plenty in the freezer and bring it out to serve with grilled cheese sandwiches. When the weather get cold!!!!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is so good! Pure comfort food! We like a little more meat, so I used a pound of hamburger and replaced the Velveeta with VT white cheddar. I was low on milk, so used a whole can of evaporated milk instead, and omitted the sour cream. It had the right thickness for our liking. This is now in our regular meal rotation.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is our new favorite. We leave out the celery, but use canned potatoes which cuts down on the cutting time. We add a can of stewed tomatoes because a cheeseburger needs ketchup. Right? as many reviewer mentioned, this soup tastes even better the second day....if it makes it past the first.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Hearty supper.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Best soup we've ever had and we really love home-made soups! EXCELLENT! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I've always wanted to make a home made soup, and I tried this recipe and it came out so good! My kids couldn't get enough of it. I even took left overs to my grandmother, who is THE cook in our family and she gobbled it up and loved it as well. My kids are already asking when I'm going to make it again. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#We love this soup. I have to double it, it tastes even better the next day.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Excellent recipe! Everyone was pleased with the outcome. I have been asked to make it again in the future. Great for a cold, blah day. This one is a keeper!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Excellent soup! I was leery of using Velveeta, because I don't really care for it, but it did make the soup. Even my teen-age daughter, who can't stand Velveeta tried the soup and loved it. Next time, I would put more meat into it. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Added the crumbled bacon and it was yummy. This soup was a big hit with my crowd. Will be making this many times over. Thnx. P.S. Don't skip the Velveeta 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Add some crumbled bacon and dice tomatoes that have been drained - absolutely yummy
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is one of our favorite soups!! I do a about a 1/4lb more beef though and you can season the meat any way that you like. I use 2% velveeta and add jalapenos on the top of mine. So delicious!!!
Cheeseburger Soup#1#0#This is for Phoebew1, why would you write a review never having made the recipe?! So you don't like Velveeta, use something else, doesn't take a rocket scientist. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Don't skip the Velveeta, it makes this dish. Velveeta has it's place and this is one of them. Food snobs will disagree but it is their lose. Made again and left out the potatoes and added chopped kosher dill pickle. Like this even better without the potatoes. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Excellent! Next time I am going to add a bit more seasoning to give it more flavor.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Great Soup! I gave some to my parents and my dad said Don't lose that recipe! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#1#This has become one of my favorite recipes!! It is very easy and absolutely wonderful!!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Very good! My kids even loved it!!!! Not good for Diabetics though... :) However this is in the family recipe book now.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Great Soup! This was my first time making this recipe and usually I don''t make adjustments the first go-around. I added 3 tsp of Dijon mustard and caraway seed. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#For my family's taste I will use more hamburger and less potatoes. We all liked it though. I followed the recipe exactly, but might try some cheddar next time. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is a very tasty, easy soup recipe! I did make a few changes (for my preferences). Instead of ground beef I used ground turkey and instead of the Velveeta I used 4 ounces cream cheese and 8 ounces shredded sharp cheddar. Because ground turkey really does not require draining I cooked the ground turkey and veggies all at the same time. Also, if you like condiments on your burgers you can always squeeze a little bit into each individual serving (might be a great suggestion for making this recipe even more kid friendly). I found that Dijon mustard works really well. This will be a regular go-to recipe for me.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#The soup was yummy and I paired it with garlic bread and a salad.I changed the recipe slightly. Added some garlic and extra cheese.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this for lunch today and I have to say it is one of the most delicious soups I have ever made. Creamy, cheesy, potatoes and beef - heaven in a bowl!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this soup last night, for the first time! It was delicious, and it will be one I use again, and again. I made some slight changes though. I used fresh rosemary, and thyme instead of basil. Really tasty. I also used white cheddar, in place of velveeta cheese. In addition to those changes, I did not have sour cream on hand, so I made a basic rue, as a thickener!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I follow this recipe exactly as written & it's delicious every time! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Good recipe but I don't like using processed cheese either so always substitute with some cheddar and a little cream cheese. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#For Clipnmom - 2 cups of cubed cheese measures volume, whereas the 8 oz. of cheese measures weight. So eight ounces of cheese, cubed, should fill a 16 oz. measuring cup.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Clipnmom - 8 oz cheese = 2 cups when grated. I use cheddar cheese or pepper jack because I don't like processed cheese. I add a dash of worchestershire sauce too. Crumbled bacon and chopped tomato on top = YUMMY! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Which is it? 8 ounces of cheese or 2cups? Help?? Please.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Good soup. Reminded me of beer cheese soup. Family loved.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is a wonderful soup recipe! I have made it multiple times over the years and it is always a big hit.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Absolutely delicious. I didn't have enough chicken broth, which is unusual for my house, so I used beef broth instead and it was delicious. My son who usually complains if I put celery in anything ate 2 big bowls and didn't even notice (I diced it very small). Thank you for sharing!!! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Prepared with 1 lb. of grd. round. Used half & half instead of milk (thats what I had on hand) used real cheese and did not use the sour cream. Very creamy as is, and full of flavor. Perfect for the 3qt. saucepot.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Modified to a slow cooker recipe and this was truly amazing. I will be making this again!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I had to make this after seeing it in my email recently and reading several of the 476 reviews. There are many items I did change to make it lighter. Such as using 93% lean ground beef, using skim milk, omitting the sour cream. I chose to use real cheese (Colby and pepper jack) vs processed velveeta. I also decided make it in the crockpot 5 hours. We basically saut?ed up the meat, vegetables and made the roux then added everything except the dairy into the slow cooker and a half hour before serving placed the milk and cheeses in the crockpot. It turned out great. It is very creamy, flavorful ,and satisfying on a cold day.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Found this recipe a few years ago and since then I've made it every year as a winter tradition meal! My kids would say this is their #1 favorite thing to eat of all time! My son even asks for it in the summer. Any time I ask what they want for dinner, his response for years now has been .. CHEESEBURGER SOUP!!! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I took this to our church's annual Chili Cook-off as an alternative for those who didn't want chili. What a surprise when I won 2nd place! People raved and were disappointed when the crockpot was empty! I had not made it before, but my family says that this needs to be a staple in our meal rotations! I track points with Weight Watchers, and even with the Velveeta, it only comes out to 9PPV. Not bad for a hearty and satisfying soup! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I signed up just to rate this soup. By far the best cheeseburger soup recipe I've tried. To say that it is a family favorite would be an understatement. My family, friends, neighbors, and co-workers love it. I added a couple of extra things, a little paprika and garlic, and it really hits the spot. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is amazing. I will definitely make this again. The ideas in the other reviews are something I will try. You won't be dissappointed. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#1#My husband ate three bowlfuls & indicated it was okay. I substituted 2 T. potato starch for the flour, used 1 1/2 T. Better Than Boullion Beef Base & shredded cheddar cheese with half and half & milk.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Never liked the sound of this. Until i tried it. This recipe is a good starting point. I almost always change things to my taste. I have used leftover grilled cheeseburgers in this and the flavor that is added from the grilling was amazing! Also have used some smoked cheddar i had on hand. Or some spicy nacho cheese from a can. I garish with your regular burger toppings tomatoes pickles A1 fried onions mushrooms. Great soup!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is a hearty and easy go to recipe for my family. Even my picky eater children like this. I substituted cheddar for velveeta and prefer the beef broth to the chicken broth after trying it both ways.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This was a big hit at Bible Study tonight. I doubled the recipe. Two guys went back for a 3rd helping. Everyone wanted the recipe. Will definitely make it again.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this soup but added 1 cup of cooked bacon and 1 Tablespoon bacon drippings. My family devoured it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This Soup is Great Comfort Food for a Cold night. I increased my Hamburger to 1 lb. Used 1 cup of Heavy Cream in at the end. And extra Velveeta Cheese about 4 oz. more. Delicious. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#1#I like this recipe better. https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/cheesy-meatball-soup
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I couldn't wait to try this soup due to the rave reviews except that is from the nutrition police. It is a filling and tasty meal but I couldn't give it more than 3 stars. Because to us it was just average. I will probably make it again and maybe add more ground beef. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#1#We wanted to try this based on all of the good reviews. But we did not like it. Little flavor and a lot of work.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I hate ranking this recipe because I did not make this strictly according to the directions because I wanted to make it a bit healthier and I eliminated the meat. However, I have no doubt that had I used the flour and butter roux it would have made the soup even richer and tastier. I was happy to find a cheese soup recipe that didn't use broccoli since one of my family members doesn't like it. I did double the recipe and it was very good! That being said here's what I did: I put the onion, celery and carrots and 1 cup of broth in the soup pot and simmered for 10 minutes. I then added the potatoes, the rest of the broth, the basil and parsley and simmered for another 10 minutes, until the potatoes were done. To thicken the soup, I then mixed some chicken broth and cornstarch in a cup and added that to the broth/veggies mix, stirring constantly. I heated the milk and Velveeta in the microwave, stirring occasionally until the cheese was mostly melted. I added the cheese/milk mix after the potatoes were cooked. I did not add any salt and I did not use the sour cream. I ended up with a delicious soup that was a bit healthier and I served it in homemade bread bowls. Very, very good! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This has been a family favorite for years! I cut the Velveeta in half. And to make it simpler, I saute my vegetables then make my cream sauce on top of them all in the same pan. So good! And healthy too!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Sorry but there are more delish way to pack on 18 grams of fat , and over 1/2 a days worth of sodinm into a singl SERVING. Some sodium can be cut by reducing celery ( who knew it is l is loaded w/ sodium ??) Velveta is tasty but most of fat and salt cone from here. I need to look further for another recipe
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This was fantastic! I followed the recipe as it is given but doubled the batch. I was afraid there wouldn't be enough that's why I doubled it but it made a lot. It was delicious, very creamy and satisfying. I will be sharing some of what's left with my mom and will have at least 2 more meals worth for the freezer. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I'm not a big soup person, but I love this soup!! I also added bacon bits, and since I hateVelveeta, I used Colby-Jack Cheese. Yummmm. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Changed it up a bit myself. Added bacon and used the bacon grease to make the rue. Added 2 c milk (skim) and low-fat sharp cheddar cheese. Was delicious!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Why did I wait so long to try this. Excellent recipe as is, but I tweaked just a tad. I doubled the meat and added a little crumbled bacon (I like bacon cheeseburgers). I subbed extra sharp cheddar for the Velveeta because I always have it and never have Velveeta. I also used plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream (I didn't want to buy a whole carton of sour cream and a single serving of the yogurt worked perfectly). Thank you, Joanie Shawhan! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is one the best I have ever had. Next time I will ad 1/2 pd of ground beef and 1/2 pd of sausage. I like It with a little more flavor. I noticed Julieeee was going to use sharp cheddar. I was wondering if it would be stringy instead of melting all the way. But I see someone used it, so I will also try that. I made it last year for 60 people at my Christmas party, they all loved it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Haha that this should be featured today...I have the ingredients on the counter waiting for this to be made tomorrow. I've just been longing for'soup' weather and it's finally heading this way. It is one of the best soups ever. I do change it up now and again...this time I'm using sharp cheddar instead of velveta. Sometimes I add bacon pieces. I've tried it using frozen hash browns, but did not care for that flavor...some weird after taste. That said, it's a wonderful recipe written as is. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is one soup everyone loved! Great flavor, very filling. A yummy recipe I need to keep!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Excellent!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Absolutely wonderful. My entire family loves this recipe and it will become a staple in my list of menu options.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is an excellent meal! I didn't change a thing in the recipe. This soup is hearty and so very good just as written. I've made it for numerous potlucks and other occasions and the pot always goes home empty. My son's friends say this is the best soup they've ever tasted! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this for a work potluck last week and it was a hit!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is awesome soup! My husband requests it regularly.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Yummy! Even my picky non soup loving family member loved it.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is a perennial favourite. I think the velveeta makes the soup tend to develop a skin on top if it cools at all, so I usually alter the recipe slightly by making a sauce of the flour, butter, milk & real cheddar and then stirring it into the soup. I have yet to find someone who doesn't like this. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This was just as delicious as it was easy... I substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. I will definitely make it again. A little goes a long way, very filling!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#pretty good very thick
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This was fantastic. Like the others, I did make a few changes: Used a full pound+ of hamburger. Used Beef Broth (nearly 4 cups), not chicken broth. Used the pre-cooked frozen hash brown potatoes to save time. Added probably another cup of velveeta, plus a big handful of shredded chedder. CONS: Took at least an hour to cook with constant attention, it's not a quick meal. Even with the added beef, it barely served six of us (and that was with a homemade loaf of bread as a side for dipping.) 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This was delicious! I did make a few changes. I used 1/2 lb. ground beef, 1/2 pound ground Italian sausage, and I also threw in 1/2 jar of real bacon bits and added liquid smoke for even more flavor. I used 4 cups of NY sharp cheddar instead of Velveeta. I also used garden vegetable broth instead of chicken broth since someone I was cooking for is allergic to chicken. Very flavorful. Will definitely make again!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is one of our favorites. I use beef stock instead of chicken for a meatier flavor, but other than that, no real changes!! And as a bonus, it freezes well, so I can make a double batch and freeze it in single serve containers for lunches or quick dinners
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Absolutely delicious! The only changes I made is that I didn't add celery (I just don't like celery, so I don't add it to anything.), and I used real shredded cheddar cheese instead of the processed stuff which is much better. It probably also made a difference that my broth was homemade. Yummy! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#What a great soup. Printing up copies for friends. Make it per recipe and tweek to your taste. Easy to work with.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#MMMMGood!!! I did add an extra 1/2 lb. hamburger. I didn't even try it with the sour cream, because it was so GOOD already. Also, it just get's tastier as leftovers! Thank you for a very tasty soup during this very long, very cold winter! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is my most favorite soup ever!! Just the way it is!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I use 4 slices bacon in place of butter, saute my onion in it, then sprinkle the flour over it cook slightly then gradually add milk and stir and add all ing., use leftover baked potato or microwave them, don't usually have velveeta so I use sharp cheddar or a mix of what I have, no carrot, celery, or herbs or sour cream, add a dash of worcheshire sauce, set aside some cooked ground beef from another recipe and it comes together very quickly, love this soup. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I mixed half cheddar and half Velveeta (I didn't have enough Velveeta on hand). Soup turned out delicious and I now get requests from the family to make it again and again! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Soup was awesome, would definitely make it again. I used 1 cup shredded cheddar instead of Velvetta. I just added it to the butter/ flour mixture and added the milk too. Then later I added another cup of cheddar cheese. Soup was not too salty, I actually had to add more salt than what the recipe called for. Also, I would definitely not add the sour cream at all. I tried the soup before adding sour cream and it was much better than after.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Super! It's -20 degrees today. I knew soup would be perfect. This was my first try and it was great! Thanks for such simple, easy to follow instructions and a great recipe. Loved it! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Delicious soup. My husband and grandson lived every last drop. Served it with cornbread. It is a new family favorite.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is one of the first recipes I made from Taste of Home. My family loves it! It is easy to double using a large stock pot, since everyone went back for seconds. A little time consuming in the preparations, but it is well worth it! Leftovers? No way!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Great Soup. Restraunt at home used it and did give out the recipe. Said it came from Taste of Home.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is a nice hearty soup for a cold winter night. My husband isn't a huge soup fan and he went for seconds. I did change it up a bit because I won't use processed cheese. I made the rue in a saucepan instead of small skillet and then added the milk to it. I then added about 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the milk mixture and whisked it in so there where no lumps. Then I added that to the beef and potato mixture in the 3qt saucepan. I mixed everything together and then added another cup of shredded cheddar cheese. I also added 2 tbsp. of Dijon mustard to give it more of a burger feel. I also used reduced sodium broth and didn't add the added salt at the end of the recipe in order to keep sodium to a minimum. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My family is still talking about this soup and I made it last week!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I just finished making this soup. My husband and I give it a thumbs up. Will try it out at work!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My picky 3 year old just cleaned her bowl, it's a keeper! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is often requested by family and at our annual soup event at church.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Wow. This soup is amazing.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Super good! I will agree with some of the reviews that it is on the salty side, but kendya gave great suggestions on how to cut down on some of the sodium content. I'll definitely keep this recipe! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this last night for dinner and used red potatoes, also used Herbox chicken broth in place of regular chicken broth. Did not have celery in the house so just omitted that. Yum.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Made this for supper tonight everyone loved it. Definitely making again. For those concerned about the sodium content you can use homemade chicken broth,use cheddar cheese instead of velveeta and unsalted butter.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have made this many times and we love it. It takes some time to prepare, but it is worth it.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#just finished eating it. wonderful! will definitely be making again
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Delicious! I left out the bayleaf, my kids don't like the taste, but it was still awesome! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this last night for supper and it is a keeper. I added cauliflower and broccoli also, and used two 14 oz cans of broth. It was not too cheesy . I will make it again! Hwniese
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup has been a top favorite of our family of 8 since the first time I made it back in Oct. 1996. Many of our kids choose it for their birthday meal entrée. It's wonderful with a hearty bread that's good for dunking in the soup. Also good with chopped up dill pickles--my personal favorite touch. :) 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This recipe is a family favorite! Also, I took it to a potluck gathering, and it was a huge hit. Great flavor! You won't be disappointed, so go ahead and give it a try! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I just made this tonight and it taste great. I did add some pork sausage to it and it tasted great with it. This is a keeper
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This recipe is a keeper! I use 1 pound of ground beef instead of the 1/2 pound in the recipe. I have never made this with carrots. The potatoes make it a very filling soup.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Made this tonite & thought it was delicious! Will use the whole pound of hamburger nxt time. Forgot to add the sour crm but it was still good! I will be making it again.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I used a whole pound of ground beef too. Great recipe and I will make it again.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this tonight, and it was great! I did change the recipe a little though. I didn't have any celery on hand, so I didn't include that. I used a full pound of hamburger, 4c of chicken broth, 2c of milk, garnished with green onion, added broccoli, and used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream because that's what I had available. I was nervous about adding so much cheese, but it wasn't too cheesy at all--it was just right. Will be making this again for sure! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this tonight, and it was delicious. I didn't have any sour cream but I had plain non fat greek yogurt, so I added that. I used a full pound of hamburger, 4c of broth and 2c of milk so it would yield more servings for my family. I also added some green onion at the end for garnish. I also added broccoli and left out the celery because I didn't have any. Overall, this is a great soup and I will make it again!! Oh, and it wasn't too cheesy either!

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Love this Soup. Such a easy one to make when it's a fall/winter day. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is our family's favorite soup. We have been making this often since it was first published in Taste of Home in 1996. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This was very good - comfort food is what my daughter called it. I used a full lb. of ground beef, and added a few drops of sriracha sauce. I will be making this again!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I would give this soup 10 stars if possible. I've been making it since the recipe was first published in Taste of Home. Everyone who tries it raves over it. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Best soup ever!! And easy to make!! Loved it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#The whole family loved it!! Best soup ever!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I love this recipe and so does everyone that has ever had it! I originally got this from a friend at work whose mother subscribed to TOH. I have made this many times over the years, I use American cheese (cheese slices) , I didn't care for the velveeta in it, So glad the recipes are all on here, makes it so much easier than searching though old magazines! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#We have been making this since we found the recipe in the TOH ground beef cookbook. It is my absolute favorite soup recipe!! It is amazing!! So good and very filling! We have to double the recipe so we have leftovers!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#i loved it. I used ground turkey in place of the beef. It stilled turned out good.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#We enjoy eating this soup and don't adjust the ingredients, but on a lighter note- it truly is hard to call it cheeseburger soup. Who puts potatoes and carrots on their hamburger? 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#It was great!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#What a hearty, yummy, easy put-ya-in-your-happy-place soup for a chilly night! YUM!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have been making this recipe for about 5 years it is one of my family's favorite's ..and the best thing you can add anything else for your own taste.... 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#The first soup I make every fall when it finally gets cool!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I recall preparing this recipe when it was featured in Taste of Home and it was delicious! I'd used 1 lb. ground beef, 3/4 cup SLICED carrots, 4 cups potatoes, peeled and cut in chunks, rather than cubed. I used 1-1/2 cups Cheddar cheese, 1-1/2 cups milk or half and half cream & used 1/4 cup Ranch dressing instead of sour cream. I found that the adjustments worked out for me! Perhaps, dicing the potatoes IS better-I'd chunked them, instead! At any rate, I really liked this recipe! If I don't have basil available, I've used Italian seasoning instead! I really enjoy the blend of Italian seasoning anyway and have turned to it when I season dishes calling for oregano or basil!DELowenstein 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This has been my daughter's favorite soup recipe since she was in 1st grade. She is now 22, and STILL ask me to make it for her. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is creamy and just like at the restaurant. I think I will cook the carrots, celery, and onion in some broth next time though. It seemed dry in the pan and when I served the soup the celery was still a little crisp. Otherwise fantastic. Easy to follow directions and very tasty!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This was great. My family loved it.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#1#never made it.. ha ha on you
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Excellent! I made this for the Super bowl one time and my family loved it. I ended up leaving the salt and pepper out completely so everyone could add it to their taste and it still tasted amazing without it.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I doubled this recipe and it came out soupy so I added leftover mashed potatoes. I think if leftover mashed potatoes aren't on hand, I'd try potato flakes to thicken it up. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I need to make this again soon. The family loved it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Made it just as written. To extend the leftovers, I baked two potatoes, unpeeled, in the microwave, chopped them and 1/2 green pepper, and added them. I topped it with a couple slices cooked bacon. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#my husband loved this soup! he said it was a keeper for sure. I did use 2% velveeta instead of regular.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I added ketchup, mustard,and chopped up pickles and it rocked!!! I'd leave the potatoes out next time, or else chop then up really tiny. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this for a Church supper and everyone thought it was great. I used frozen hash brown potatoes. The rue I made in the microwave in a large bowl and added the milk to that and melted the cheese before adding it to the soup pot.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Super. I added 1/2 lb chopped bacon to mine. Have some xtra chicken broth in case you want it more soupy. Great recipe....will make many times over!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This a winner! Only change I made was to dice potatoes a little smaller at family's request. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This was so delicious! Next time I make it I will double the recipe so that we have more leftovers. I made it in the early afternoon and left it warming on the stove. My boyfriend helped himself to a little bit all day so we only had 2 bowls leftover after dinner. Have already made this twice and will definitely make again. My boyfriend put some ketchup on his to make it taste more like a cheeseburger.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This was easy to make and very tasty. I used 1 pound of 93% lean hamburger, skim milk and all the rest of the ingredients as listed. It was yummy and my hubby says it is a keeper.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Th only thing I will change is the basil. I would cut the amount in half. I also will experiment and sub. oregano for the basil.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this as a vegetarian dish, with Yves meatless ground (which is better than the frozen kind, and usually around $3 for a package that equals 1 pound of ground beef.) Like others I also used cheddar in place of the velveeta, and since the meatless ground beef adds texture but not a lot of flavor I also added imitation bacon bits to add a little meat flavor. It came out delicious, with a wonderful texture. I will certainly be making this again! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#SOUNDS FAB
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I questioned some of the ingredients but it was fantastic! Should be called a Cheeseburger potato soup. Tasted like I was eating a baked potato with a cheeseburger on top. The soup also looked like Queso dip which made my kids excited to eat it! :)
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Delicious and super easy made the house smell great on a frigid winter day!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My 9 year old daughter and I found this recipe while looking up what to make out of the ordinary with hamburger meat. She did most of it with me doing the cutting, and it was... Amazing! Probably the best soup I've ever made and we were both hesitant at first before we started cooking it. We browned the meat with a half can of diced green peppers for a mild kick, and used baby red potatoes and I cannot wait to have leftovers again tonight!! We also made some homemade bread and stuffed a slice in each bowl and oh man it was wonderful!! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This was very good. I will use a no salt broth next time though.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Very tasty soup and my kids and husband really liked it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Delicious. I will continue to make this soup.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My newest favorite soup. Just gotta be careful when making the rue (butter with flour). If you overcook it, the recipe won't turn out right. Like others said, it wasn't hard to make at all. Helps to use the food processor for the veggies for quicker preperations. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#One of the best soups I've eaten. I'm sure I will make it often. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#simple and delicious, most ingredients i normally have, I've made this before with sliced and shredded cheese(whatever I had in the fridge) and it came out great 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this soup recently for a family gathering and everybody loved it! I received lots of compliments and recipe requests! I doubled the recipe and used lean hamburger, Velveeta made with 2% milk, 2% milk and light sour cream- very tasty.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is one of my go-to soups. We make a double batch and freeze the left overs. Makes a good make-ahead meal. Love it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is so easy and my family loves it! My 5 year old rarely eats leftovers but has eaten this one 3 times since the first night I made it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I prepared this dish for a holiday get-together and received great feedback.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I got this same recipe 10 years ago and instead of ground beef o have used bacon, ham, and even venison. comes out great every time and i am expected to make it on holidays with my inlaws. careful on salt if you use ham or bacon and get rid od grease id you use bacon or ham.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Knew from the start this recipe needed to be doubled. Added 1 lb. chicken/beef meatballs sliced in half, plus about 2 c. petite mixed frozen vegetables 10 mins. before serving. Along with a whole wheat hard roll = nummy nummy in my tummy !
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Absoultely sensational. I LOVE this soup. And I am not a big soup eater.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Excellent!I keep the skin on the potatoes. Instead of Velveeta (we are not big fans), we used Pepper Jack Cheese, shredded. It really gave this soup a kick!I also reduced the salt and used 1/2tsp pepper. Keeper!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Awesome! Here are some changes we did to the recipe:- 1/2c carrots...will do 3/4c next time- did not peel potatoes- Replaced velveeta with an 8 oz block of pepper jack, shredded...Really gave it a kick!Served with hot fresh homemade potato bread :)
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have made this recipe several times now, sometimes substituting ground turkey for the beef and it is still excellent. I also sometimes add bacon to it to make it a bacon cheeseburger soup!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Made this just as the recipe says and it was great. Served it for company and everyone wants the recipe.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Make some bacon and crumble it on top of the soup before serving. Delicious!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Soup tasted great but it tasted nothing like a cheeseburger. More like a cheesey potato soup with hamburger added.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#this was perfect!!! family loved it!! next time i will double the recipe!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This gave me a very good starting recipe to work with for Cheeseburger Soup. Because I am feeding 5 adults, I used a full pound of ground beef and 14 oz of velveeta and 5 pounds of potatoes. I am not a fan of the carrots and celery in this soup so I left them out and added garlic powder, a little cayenne powder. I also used 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of whole milk to have a little more richness in the soup.I will make this soup many more times. Thank you so much for the recipe.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I followed this recipe exactly. It was so blah, no flavor at all. I kept adding more cheese and seasonings. It looked good but had no taste.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I wonder when this poter came up with this recipe. Becuase I have the exact same recipe I got from a cook book that is at Least 20 years old.Yes it is a gret soup, but this seems to me as if it is copied.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have been making this soup for years and years. It is a family favorite and gets rave reviews from everyone who has had it! Try it, you will LOVE it.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this soup and my whole family loved it. It was easy to made and plan to make it often. The only think I changed was put in a little more cheese (sharp cheddar) as we love cheese.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I've been making a variation of this for years. My husband loves it.Tip: it's way easier to add the extra butter and then the flour to the celery and onion mixture than it is to make a separate roux. You have more control over how thick your soup will be and you don't have to mess up an extra pan. It's an extra step that's very unnecessary.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Very tasty and kid friendly!!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I read some of the other reviews so I added some diced tomato's and cayenne powder to give it a kick. Really, thick, rich soup that sure works on a rainy, winter night! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Absolutely yummy! Doubled the beef and cheese and 1 1/2 times the broth to make a bigger batch. Also, cooked it slow in my crock pot for 4 hrs.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#We've been cooking this soup for over ten years now and we still get request for it at every family get together. Prep takes a little bit of time but oh so worth it!! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My family all loved this I added a 1lb hamburger but my 6 year old said it needed more. Next time I will add more but it was very good.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#The best soup I have ever made. Cheesey, beefy, potatoey goodness.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Our whole family loves this recipe...love when the cooler weather gets here so I can get back to making it!!! Wouldn't change a thing!! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup got rave reviews from my hungry hunters last night. To shorten up the prep time I have used hashbrowns and frozen celery/onion/carrots. We garnished it with shredded cheddar and crispy bacon. Definitely a keeper recipe.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Sooo yummy!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Delicious soup! I skipped the basil and added chopped green chile. Now my hubby's favorite soup! Thanks for sharing the recipe! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Delicious soup! I skipped the basil and added chopped green chile. Now my hubby's favorite soup! Thanks for sharing the recipe! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Have made this recipe about 4 times already in the past few months, its a family favorite! Followed the recipe exactly and it has been perfect. Like comfort food in a soup!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#DH and I liked it but my kids wouldn't even try it. It was really good though. Kind of labor intensive though. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is terrific my whole family loves it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This may not have been the quickest soup to throw together but it was well worth it. I can't wait to make it again. I used 1 T. each fresh parsley and basil and I used the whole pound of hamburger which was the right amount compared to the amount of potatoes. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Added a beer, hot sauce, extra cup of cheddar and chicken broth to give it the kick we wanted. Served with baguette.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I've had this recipe in my file for years, and made it again the other night. My entire family, even the complainers about soup, love this recipe. It's fairly easy to make and very hearty. I use ground turkey instead of ground beef and it's delicious. Glad to rediscover it and will be making it more frequently. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I've been making this for many years. My kids grew up eating this and they still love it today! The only change I've made is that I use American cheese from my deli, because I prefer it's taste. Wonderful comfort food! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I found the recipe while waiting in the dentist office years ago. My family loves this soup. My children are grown now, so at Christmas each year I make some of their favorites and freeze them as gifts. Big Winner.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Everybody loved it.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I used a whole pound of ground turkey and 2 whole cans of chicken broth plus a half can of water. Otherwise I did the recipe as written and it was excellent!!! Everyone liked it and it was very hearty. Will make it again.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have made this soup for years - it's still a favorite of my kids - my son continues to request it when he comes over for a meal. I make a big batch so that we can have leftovers in the fridge for a couple of days afterward. Hearty and delicious! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup was excellent! I couldn't wait for my husband to ghet home from work...I had a small bowl at 2:20 in the P.M. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#great soup! I followed the recipe exactly, but then ended up adding a tsp of dijon mustard at the end for a little kick.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is so good I have to be careful not to make it to often
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Our whole family loves this recipe. I am making it again today. Our children get to choose what I make for dinner as a part of their birthday celebration, and you would hardly believe the elaborate meals I've had to prepare in the past. This year, my son didn't hesitate for a second before he said, Cheeseburger soup! That's pretty high praise! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#All the chopping and pre-cooking of the hamburger could be done a day ahead. Gave my husband a big bowl for lunch; he came back for more! We love this soup and will definitely be making it again! Would also be good to take to a sick friend! Wonderful recipe!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Nice one..I liked the recipe!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Pretty good recipe. I made mine low-fat, low-calorie; ground turkey, no butter but 1 tbps when sauteeing veggies, 2% velvetta, RF sour cream, skim milk, etc. Would make again but add about 4 oz more cheese this time, I didn't think it was cheesy enough. Tasted better the next day heated up. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I really didn't care for this soup at all. Sorry to say it was a throw away, a waste of time. I've enjoyed others better. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I added another cup of broth and 1/4 tsp grd. red pepper. Very good, even my 18 yr old grandson loved it.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I make this soup quite frequently. It's one of our favorites! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Really good, my picky grandkids even liked it. I doubled the recipe and served two families.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Too bland for my taste, even though I don't like spicy foods either. I had a lot left over & if I had served it again, intended to add a can of crushed tomatoes. Instead, after a few days in the frig, I just threw it out. It needed something - just not sure what. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this for our family of six last night. It doubles well, but takes longer than the given times. All of my children ate it without complaining which is a huge achievement. Three of them gave it compliments. I added some petite frozen peas (partially defrosted) at the end of the cooking time to add some more veggies to our meal. I think that it is a new favorite.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Love it! I make it for my family, and occasionally for a work potluck. It always gets rave reviews. Sometimes I add a cup of cheddar to it - we like it cheesy here.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I make this regularly for my husband and I, and occasionally for a potluck. Everyone raves about it. I frequently add a cup or so of cheddar, but we really like cheese here. Love it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This was a fun soup to serve, everyone added their favorite condiments. It was very thick so I added an extra cup of chicken broth and skipped the flour. Also, I did use 1#of burger which made it thicker. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have been making this soup for over 10 yrs. It is a favorite with my family!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I make this often, wonderful flavor. My 3 and 5 year old grandkids were over and couldn't get enough of it. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Excellent!! Excellent!! Excellent!! Made this for my household and the neighbors and all six people raved about it!! Will definitely make it again!!!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this recipe when we were both under the weather. I thought it had a very good flavor, but I substituted 1 cup of heavy cream for part of the milk. I left out the basil, but added garlic. I went a little lighter on the salt, and I'm glad I di. I used real cheese instead of Velveeta, and fewer potatoes. The next time I make it, I'm going to add at least 8 strips of bacon, chopped fine and maybe a hit of dijon mustard, to keep it'cheeseburger-y'. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I think I was looking for something extra special in this soup, but it wasn't there--quite a bit of work for something that tasted merely average. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is really good. I added a can of drained diced tomatoes...left out the salt. The Velveeta has enough for us. YUM
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is my second time making Great recipe - The only thing I did different was adding hot sausage with the hamburger. I would make again. this is a keeper
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Awesome! Kids loved it! Highly recommend!!Used bacon in it and it was great...kids asked for seconds!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#It was ok, i thought it was more of a potato and cheese soup versus a Cheeseburger Soup. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Very good. Modified with turkey and added a can of Italian diced tomatoes. Only drawback is that its a lot of prep time.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My five kids absolutely loved this twist on potato soup!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Just want to say I like buzzbombz suggestions. keep up the good work.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This was a super tasty soup that my WHOLE family enjoyed (Hard to do when you have a Carnivore, an Herbivore, and an Omnivore at the same table) I added bacon to it and it was delicious. Will definitely be making this again.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is so flavorful. With some crusty bread it was the perfect meal for us.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My family was not crazy about this soup. It had a comforting quality to it but was lacking in flavor or something. None of us cold put our finger on what was missing.? If I make not again, I will experiment a little.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is delicious; but I only gave it 4 stars because it is so much work. I have found an easier version made in the crockpot that I will make from now on.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is by far my favorite soup. I did make some changes to make it less fatting. I use turkey burger instead of beef burger and cook the onion, celery and carrots with the meat, ommiting the butter. I used skim milk, and 2% Velveeta cheese and thickened it with cornstarch and cold water. I also use fat free sour cream. I have made this soup several times and it is sooooo good.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Excellent, everyone in the family loved it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Four stars for over-abundance of fat, sodium content - uninteresting seasonings.Thought suggestions might be welcome since soup is basically the same name and the different ingredients could offer some flexibility. It's such a simple recipe, I never thought to submit it. Thanks chocoholiclady for understanding the comments & reasoning.....lessened the attack. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#@ lilaccrew, directions state:Cheeseburger SoupTell us what you think of this recipe.Did you modify it? Would you make it again? And what of your statement is a review? Very good recipe as is but due for health reasons our family too has since found ways to modify it to meet our needs similar to those buzzbombz posted.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#@ buzzbombz, why would you give it 4 stars and then post a different recipe? You should just review this one and then submit your own separately. ??
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I've made this soup twice & both times it was a huge hit! Everyone loved it, including me. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is excellent but I added a minced jalapeno and made it spicy cheeseburger soup!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is a recipe I would definitely make again. I made a few changes and used ground turkey breast and shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of Velvetta. It got rave reviews from my family.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Wouldn't change a thing. Not quick and easy but well worth the trouble. I made cream sauce with flour, milk and butter, then added the cheese, then added that to other ingredients. Whole family loves it. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Excellent flavor and texture. Nice spices. Simple ingredients. It becomes more creamy as you stir it. The potato cubes become mashed.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This was outstanding. Great comforting soup.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Make a similar version - using ground turkey, Worchestershire sauce, touch of chili powder or Tabasco, garlic, sm can of Ro-tel diced tomatoes, bag of frozen corn and 8-oz bag of low-fat Mexican shredded cheese added toward end - don't need the flour with natural starch from corn & potatoes. Very hearty comfort food! Great with corn bread!!! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have been making this soup for quite a few years and continue to receive raving comments when serving it to guests. It has great flavor when reheated too!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made it for a work fundraiser and it was a big hit. I will make it again but we did add some extra seasonings.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have been making this recipe for years and my family loves it! I add a 2 large cloves of chopped garlic to give it a garlic burger taste
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this recipe as is but for my second bowl I added ketchup & mustard and it was delicious - definitely tasted like a cheeseburger!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Made this hearty and tasty soup for the first time tonight. I made the following changes and it turned out delicious. Increased the meat to 1 #, increased the onions, carrots and celery to 1 cup each, slightly increased all the remaining ingredients except for the salt which I decreased to 1/2 teas. , used low sodium chicken broth, used 1/2 shredded cheddar and 1/2 velveeta cheese . It's a bit of work and makes a large batch, but it's good! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Second time I have made this soup and its excelent, my family loves it. I used ground deer meat this time,
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My family just loves this delicious, hearty and creamy soup!!! I make a double batch and freeze it for lunches.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Our kids and I love this recipe, but my husband isn't crazy about it for some reason. I make this on nights he has to work. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Absolutely Fantastic!! Followed the recipe exactly, it was really delicious. Definitely will make again.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My entire family loved this recipe. They usually don't like much so that is a huge compliment! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Made this soup tonight, the family LOVED it. Will definitely put it in the cookbook to make again. Thanks!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Great recipe! Made almost exactly as written (left out the sour cream since it was already so creamy). My husband and I both loved it and can't wait to make it again. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My family LOVED this soup. We all added hamburger pickle slices to our individual bowls and it gave it a whole new flavor, fantastic!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Delicious.... Especially on a cold day, sitting around watching football!! Big hit with my kids! It's a keeper! Definately would make again! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have made this soup for the family and for church events; everyone loves it from kids to the elderly.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Just made it for the second time and it's absolutely great. I didn't use as much cheese but I followed the recipe the rest of the way. An Excellant soup. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup was awesome!!! My family loved it. Great flavor and very filling.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is wonderful! I did use ground turkey instead of ground beef! I also did not add salt because there was a lot of salt in the cubes that I used for the chicken broth. I love it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Easy to fix and absolutely delicious! Will definitely make this again
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Sooo good! I used more cheese and onion and meat. Everyone loved it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#ABSOLUTELY delicious! This is my family's new favorite soup! I didn't have celery either and it was still so tasty! I added 1 tsp oregano and 1 tsp thyme for extra flavor:-) 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Cooked again. It is very tasty like usually!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#One of the best hearty soup recipes ever. Great when the weather turns cool. We serve it with my Mom's homemade buttermilk biscuits and everyone loves it. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Myself, mother and extended family makes this soup. We all love it. I use Kraft singles and add cooked bacon.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I just got done making this for dinner tonight, I used italian sausge meat as well with ground beef. Turned out good!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have made this often. Saw an episode of Diners, Drive ins, and Dives where a restaurant served something almost exactly the same. They put some fresh chopped iceburg lettuce and fresh chopped tomatoes in the bottom of the bowl BEFORE putting the soup in. Sounds weird, huh? Know what? IT'S AMAZING!! Try it! Oh, and top the soup with some croutons! So good! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Wow! Very good but I put less butter and cheese another way it will be very buttery and cheesy! Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Very good. My friend thought he would prefer it with a little less cheese.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My family absolutely loved this, even my youngest daughter who declares that she does not like soup! Thanks for posting and sharing!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Fantastic flavor, chowder consistency...my husband and I loved it and will make it again!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Made this for dinner last night! Best soup ever! My family loved it and can't wait for me to make it again! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this soup last night after reading all the wonderful reviews. Taking a few suggestions from others, I added minced garlic, instant potatoes, one envelope of Lipton's onion soup and bacon bits. Oh so yummy. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Take a little of time to get the ingredients ready but it is well worth the time. It is a very yummy and filling soup. My husband gives it a thumps up and wants me to make it again.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this soup for dinner last night based on reviews that stated their husbands do not care for soup, but loved this one. My husband does not care for soup, but I LOVE all soups. I thought this soup was really good and would definately eat it again. My husband said it was OK and would eat it again as a filler. The only change I made was to use 1 pound of hamburger. I can't imagine that 1/2 pound would be enough. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Amazing!! I never liked potato soup until this. It always seemed bland before,but this recipe is flavorful and yummy! I did add a little red pepper flakes because we like everything spicy. I also added a can of mushrooms because my husband like sauted onions and mushrooms on a burger.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Excellent recipe and directions are easy to follow. My only suggestion is to have fun with the recipe and serve pickle relish and ketchup on the side. My guestsenjoyed the recipe and laughed. Made their evening!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have made this recipe for over ten years and everyone always asks for the recipe. I also got the recipe from the 1997. cookbook.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is an awesome recipe. Have made it many times. I also have the cookbook that it first came out in. I usually double the recipe so I can have leftovers. Have used frozen hash browns when I'm in a hurry. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this recipe for our family of three and we ate it two nights in a row -- that's how much we all loved it! I didn't add the sour cream, so it came out v-e-r-y cheesy, which was perfect for us! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Love this soup! Hearty and Delicious!I did tweak it a little. 1.5 cups beef, extra 2c. broth, 2c. gourmet blend of shredded cheese instead of velveeta. 1/2c extra sour cream.I basically increased the size of the recipe and used shredded cheese instead of velveeta. Yummy! My kids love it.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Very nice recipe! This soup was really good and filling. Great leftovers for next day lunch too. Will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is one of our favorite soups. Thanks you for this great recipe. We make this at least 3 times a month.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Loved this. It is not a soup you can through together after work, but it doesn't taste like that either. Tastes like Grandma would have made. Loved it!!!! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have the cookbook that this recipe is in from 1997. We LOVE this recipe. I have substituted a few things (cheddar cheese for the velvetta - if you do substitute, add more salt - I think it needs a bit more salt even with Velvetta. And I cut up Red Potatoes and leave the skin on.) and make it so often I don't even measure anymore, but always a hit. I love the leftovers for my lunch the next few days. So good with some biscuits! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#For me, there wasn't enough seasoning - so I would double the salt and pepper and I'm gonna try it with a clove or two of garlic next time. It could be because I omitted the onions, no one in my family likes them. But with a little change up this would be amazing - was still pretty good though. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I am not a soup person, and I love this soup. I can't wait to have it the next day for lunch. It is really good fresh and left over. I do use a full pound of ground beef and try to use healthier ingredients, such as 2% Velveeta, low-sodium chicken broth, and fat-free milk. It is delicious and the extra sodium/fat is not missed. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Didn't change a thing. Turned out delicious. Next time I won't cut the potatoes too small, like someone suggested. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Excellent soup - I use instant potato flakes to thicken it.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have been making this for years. This my husband's favorite. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Love this soup It is my kids favorite. I even had to write it down for my son when he got married.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This dish is absolutely delicious! I didn't change a thing about it and I received more compliments from this recipe than anything I've ever made. I made a batch and took it work where they were just about licking their bowls! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My Husband does not like soup very much but he loves this recipe!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#awesome taste! i used leftover taco meat from the night before and added 1/2 cup of mixed veggies because I only had one baking potato to use.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I've been making this recipe for years. It's a family favorite especially during those chilly fall and winter months. The only change I make is that I use a full pound of ground beef. This hearty soup along with some dinner rolls or other bread and you have a wonderful meal! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Very good! I used 1 lb ground beef, 1 med. Onion chopped, 1 large Carrot shredded and the 1/4 tops out of 4 Celery sticks including the leaves chopped.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is amazing. I used half and half instead of milk, omitted the sour cream and the celery. It was perfect and I am making it again this minute!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup has great flavor. I didnt even add any of my own seasonings to it which is something that I almost always do, I thought it seemed a little thick so I added about 2 cups of water when boiling the veggies and potatoes and then I also didnt include the sour cream. Great recipe!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I Love this Soup! I first made this last year for a soup pot luck and Mine was the one all gone at the end. Several people wanted the receipe. I make this all the time in the winter. Kids love this soup too! I omit the celery cause I hate celery. by shredding the carrots you don't even know they are in there by the time it's all cooked. Great way sneaking healthy foods in.. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is a favorite at our church functions. Have made it many times. Absolutely love it!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Very quick and EASY recipe. I had to change up some of the recipe, but was still fantastic! I substituted a few items for things I already had at home: Beef Broth instead of Chicken Broth, I used real Mayo instead of sour cream, and I diced baby carrots instead of grating them.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is my one of my favorite soups! I usually double the recipe when I fix it. I serve this at least 1-2 times during the winter months. Kids of all ages love it.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I've made this soup twice...first for just my husband and I and the next time for company. Absolutely wonderful! Everyone loved it...I followed the recipe exactly. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have made this several times and we love it. It have become one of our grandchildren's favorites. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I must admit the first time that I saw this recipe, I thought no way... but tried it anyway. My husband & I have had this twice already.. It is SO Tasty & not at all as heavy as I thought it would be!! I would definitely recommend this soup.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Great recipe. Cut the potatoes in small pieces. I cut mine in large chunks and that messed up the texture. That was my fault and I will correct it in the future. Other than that don't change a thing. 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#It needs something to make it a little zippy. Next time I may add some peppers and mustard.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is so good!!! I did 1 pound ground beef, didn't measure the veggies or seasonings (just did as much as I liked), added more seasonings, left out the salt, and I used process cheese slices-maybe use a little less cheese slices next time. And I didn't add the sour cream. So yummy!

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I used 1 lb. of ground beef and American processed cheese slices instead and it worked out great since my family enjoys more beef in their soup. I have been making this recipe since it came out in the magazine many years ago! LOVE IT and share it with many people! It's always a favorite that is requested at our Lenten Dinners at Church each year.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#My sister and i made it and loved it. totally going to make it again but put some chili powder in it.
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I think I will use a reduced sodium Velveeta next time I make this soup. I have an older version of this recipe that does not include potatoes, parsley nor flour, but 2 cups of cooked rice instead. Even though the rice was ok, I will make this recipe again, but instead of the rice, I'll use the potatoes. I'm looking forward to posting about this version!

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Two granddaughter were here for the week-end ages 13 and 16. We all loved it. 13 year old asked me to make it for her birthday and suddenly remembered her birthday is past this year, so she said I mean for Christmas. LOL I left out the mushrooms but the package of ground beef that I had thawed out was a little over 1 pound and it was wonderful. Thank you

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Good kid friendly recipe. I agree with the other poster, about leaving out the sour cream. It did give it a Stroganoff flavor. I didn't have parsley and basil so I used Italian seasoning instead and it turned out just fine.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#1#This soup should be called potato -cheeseburger soup because there are SO many potatoes. They are very good though. It's true that kids LOVE this soup. Mine did and asked for it all week. Fortunately, I made a double batch. I think the Velveeta made it kid friendly. This recipe is a keeper in our house.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I was so excited about this recipe but my husband and I felt there was something missing. We will try it again as a base but play around with the seasoning. We thought the sour cream made it seem like Stroganoff soup so we'll leave that out next time.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is the best soup ever!!!
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This recipe was pretty good. I used a pound of ground beef instead of a half pound, and I left my potatoes on too high of heat for too long (I got a phone call) so they went mushy and dissolved. Other than that it was really good, and I would recomend it to anyone who loves cheeseburgers and soup!

The flavors are much more complex than I expected. This recipe is a real winner that I will be making again and again.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have made this soup several times this winter. My family will empty the pot. It is so easy and simple to make. One thing that I did to save time was to use a 2 pound bag of hashbrowns instead of peeling and chopping the potatoes. I also cooked 6 or 8 strips of baccon, broke it apart and sprinkled the cooked bacon pieces as a garnish. It was a hit!!

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I always read the reviews to see if I feel I need to make changes. I did double the ground beef and used half canned milk and half 1% milk. Then doubled the recipe. Only problem I had was my husband complained that I gave too much away because it was so good. Quadrupled it for a light lunch at Christmas Eve for the whole family. Loved by all, even the pickiest eaters.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I doubled the beef and thought it was much better. Also you don't need to peel the potatoes, I've made it both ways and you can't tell a difference. I only use three cups of potatoes and leave out the salt - the velveeta has MORE than enough salt already! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Actually, maybe I will make this again. I used one pound of ground beef like man suggested and it was a little too beefy. Otherwise, good.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I made this last night for supper and it was delicious! I had made a roast the night before so I used my leftover carrots and potatos in this soup. Only thing is for our family next time I will add a bit more hamburger.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is a family favorite. I usually use Cheese Whiz instead of the Velvetta cheese. Very filling. Make a loaf of beer bread to serve along with it...YUM YUM

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Love this soup!! I make a meat-free version also, just saute the veggies in a little butter or olive oil and then add the broth and potatoes.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Pretty good soup, but it needs a bit much seasoning, such as red pepper flakes & garlic. And some crumbled crispy bacon mixed in would be terrific.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I've been making his for years---ever since I found the recipe in a Taste of Home cookbook. I use 4 cups of frozen hashbrowns to cut the prep time.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This soup is awesome! I did not have any ground beef but had some pot roast left over so I cut in small chunks and added instead. Delicious warm and hearty soup. (a few chopped jalepenos added would be a good addition too)

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This is my all time favorite
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This was so good! One of my favorite soups I've tried so far. I usually don't care for recipes with velveeta, but it's perfect for this. I used skim milk, 2% velveeta, and reduced fat sour cream (and lean ground beef), and it was still excellent! Tastes like at a restaurant, but with the reduced-fat ingredients, probably much healthier!

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I make this recipe all the time and LOVE it! It's great with home made french bread. Works great over a campfire too!

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I've made this soup twice--once with ground beef and once with a rotisserie chicken--and it is easily one of the best soup recipes I have ever made. I, too, add more liquid but follow the recipe otherwise. It's one of my new favorites!

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have several favorite soup recipes and I'm adding this one to the list. Delicious! 
Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Outstanding! I used a full pound of beef and fresh basil (because I had it) but otherwise I followed the recipe. I would suggest, and next time I will,add more liquid as It is very thick. This will become a regular.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have been making this soup since I first saw this recipe, about 2 years ago. It is my husbands favorite. I do add more veggies, and more milk or broth as needed to get the consistance we like, so I end up with close to a gallon of soup. I like to add chopped sweet potatoes, a bag if mixed veggies, or whatever veggies I have on hand. I love all the different colors. This soup is a wonderful base to add anything you like.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#One bite and my husband said'this is amazing'. I doubled the recipe and had leftovers. I said I'm going to put the rest in the freezer for another night and he said NO you're not, I am eating this tomorrow! . I did dice up some tomato and iceburg lettuce and garnish to soup with it when served. The cold lettuce and tomato were awesome with the hot soup. I must give credit to Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives for that idea. We will be having this again.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#This has been one of our favorite meals for many years and it's a real kid pleaser. I use my food process to chop the onions, carrotts and celery small to hide them from picky eaters. I don't thicken with the butter and flour, I just use instant potato flakes which uses less fat and is easier. Flavor is the same.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I used left over taco meat, part of the meat was froze so the chunks weren't that big. Next time I'll be sure next time to not use frozen left overs, but it still turned out great! Thank you Joanie for the excellent reciepe :)

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#I have been making this for years and I love it but this time I have to substitute the sour cream, for evaporated milk and vinegar. I always put extra cheese in as my son likes it a little thicker.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#Great recipe, I always have precooked ground beef ready to go in my freezer, cuts some of the prep time down, definitely adhere to the cooking times so the potatoes stay firm.

Cheeseburger Soup#0#0#So nice on a cold night! Great with cornbread to round out the meal. Very easy to make. The hardest part was chopping all the veggies. I did substitute 2 tablespoons of cornstarch for the flour. I just mixed it in with 1 cup of the milk that was called for. Thanks for sharing.

Amish Breakfast Casserole#7#0#I am not a fan of cottage cheese at all outside of substituted for ricotta in lasagna. I made this exactly as written. It was so easy to put together and so good. It was even better reheated for leftovers. Thank you for this wonderful recipe. It could have many substitutions as in meat or cheese and perhaps veggies thrown in. I could not get over how flavor filled it was. Just a total joy to put in my mouth.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#6#21#I made this; added fresh spinach, green pepper, and mushrooms. Used a swiss/gruyere cheese combo, and some cheddar. It still was very bland, and I think that was due to the potatoes, which really need to be cooked first in order to have any flavor. Otherwise, the potatoes just overpower everything else in it.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#13#2#Made this tonight for dinner. Followed the recipe but added diced ham, baby spinach and a handful of cherry tomatoes from the garden. Family loved it and it can work for any meal.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#20#1#I use diced ham I purchase in the package instead of bacon, the bacon was too greasy for me. I also add spinach, and/or green pepper.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#34#8#I love this recipe. I've made it several time and always end up with a clean dish. I add extra bacon, natures seasoning, and use simply potatoes for convenience. I make it the night before and take it out the next morning and cook. It's my go to casserole
Amish Breakfast Casserole#31#13#I've made this many times and it's wonderful. I've taken it to different potluck breakfasts and to the home bound and receive many compliments. You can easily change things to suit your taste and can change the cheeses but the Swiss really does make this stand out.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#2#19#Not impressed. Meshy and salty from that amount of bacon.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#12#6#Yummy! Yummy! Due to high fat and salt content, this is our Once A Year' treat. But, yummy.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#12#3#Great recipe, can I make it a day ahead of time and cook next day, thanks Rick
Amish Breakfast Casserole#8#1#I really enjoyed this dish, and made it as written (cut in half ) and used Simply Potatoes for the hash brown component. It was an excellent breakfast twice! In the future I'll probably cut back on the bacon, or use leftover ham. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#9#0#This is my go to breakfast casserole. I like to add cooked asparagus and extra cheese. Definitely worth the calories. Easy to make the night before and bake in the morning.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#7#16#Saved this to my home screen folder and will be making it this weekend for dinner. Thanks for sharing! *EDIT 4/11/22*Made this tonight for dinner. We don't really care for Swiss cheese and we couldn't find Gruyere, so I subbed about 3/4 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano and I used scallions instead of white, sweet onion because they give egg dishes a metal taste. Didn't need, but a half of a teaspoon of kosher salt and about a teaspoon of white pepper. I also added some diced green pepper and we both loved it. Next time I will grate some fresh garlic and sauté the vegetables separately from the bacon. Delicious! Definitely a keeper! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#37#12#This was an very tasty recipe! I used Jimmy Dean Turkey sausage links cut up instead of bacon. I also added a small amount of diced green pepper with the onion. I used Fat Free cheddar jack shredded cheese plus the Swiss cheese. I did 1/3 of the recipe and put it in muffin tin!! It was amazing!!! Do try it!!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#21#0#I made this during the holidays and it was delicious. I am making it again for breakfast tomorrow. I highly recommend trying this dish.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#17#1#I've made this for several family gatherings and everyone raves about it and wants the recipe. It is so cheesy and good. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#33#8#LOVED THIS..followed to the letter...well, I did sprinkle extra cheese on top last few minutes...! Can never have too much cheese! Have never eaten this sort of hot dish before and first time making it..( did do half recipe in 8x8 pan..and mixed up at night..kept in fridge..baked next day...GREAT RESULTS..THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#36#5#Delicious as written and so easy to change up for personal preference. Even my cottage cheese haters loved it! I run my cottage cheese through the food processor to give it the consistency of ricotta. Just takes a minute or two. I use this hack for lasagne too.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#33#1#I have made this dish with Sausage needless to say the dish was a big hit.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#18#1#This is so easy to make. I used bacon and it was delicious and easy. We did this as breakfast for dinner, but I will use this for breakfast when I have company for the holidays.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#39#4#I love this casserole! It is easy to prepare, can be made the day before, and everyone enjoyed it. I doubled the recipe for a houseful of July 4th weekend guests this year and it was the first thing to disappear off the buffet table! A definite keeper!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#20#5#I made this for the first time and it as a complete success. It was for a brunch women's Bible study. Its easy to make, just a little time consuming. Other than that, love it. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#33#3#This was a very good breakfast casserole. I didn't have bacon on hand. I used sausage instead and the casserole tasted great. This is going in my recipe book. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#43#10#This is by far my favorite breakfast casserole. It is always a hit. I made it just like the recipe above the first time and it was good. Now I add 2 extra eggs for a total of 8. I also use Morton's Nature Seasoning. I do bacon the majority of the time but have added sausage as well. I also use Simply Potatoes hash browns in place of frozen.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#41#7#This is an excellent recipe! Yes, it has less eggs than most breakfast casseroles, it is more of a hashbrown casserole than egg casserole and that's ok! I made this for my DIL's baby shower and got many compliments and requests for the recipe. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#44#2#It is just my husband and me, so I prepared half the recipe and used an 8 x 8 baking dish. We thoroughly enjoyed this casserole. I put it together the night before and let it sit out for about 30 minutes before baking. I will certainly make this recipe again. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#15#0#Wow! Delicious! I cooked it in the skillet I fried bacon and onions in and it turned out perfect. I usually don't like breakfast casseroles but; this one is amazing! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#6#0#Delicious! I used turkey bacon and added dried cilantro. Baked 40 minutes in my 2quart oval glass baker!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#11#0#I have been making this casserole for Christmas morning ever since I saw it in Taste of Home years ago. Everyone loves it!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#13#1#I made this on Christmas Eve to serve Christmas morning. I am so glad I did! It was easy and deliciouseven reheated great with a splash of milk to loosen it up a few days later. This is a keeper and great to use when you want to save yourself time on a holiday or when you have guests.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#13#1#Have been making this one for years. I did alter for our taste. I use 1/2 lb bacon and 1/2 lb ham. I add jalapeños and use 10 eggs. Please note, this requires a longer baking time. I plan for an hour and a half as I let it stand for 10 minutes before serving.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#14#2#Family favorite. I add 10-12 eggs because it's an egg casserole'. I use spicy chicken sausage instead of bacon sometimes.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#4#11#I was not a big fan. It was easy to make but used more ingredients and was more expensive to make than another recipe I have.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#9#0#I make this every year for Christmas morning breakfast. It's delicious! I use 9 eggs per the recipe I have. Everything else is the same.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#11#13#This came out delicious. And, I have to confess I modified it okay changed it due to what I had in the fridge. I used 1lb of Italian sausage, Monterey jack cheese only, fresh spinach and baked frozen tater tots 10 minutes! I didn't mix it altogether but built it like a quiche: Meat/onions/spinach mixture on the bottom, Monterey Jack cheese and then the egg, cheese and cottage cheese mixture. Topped it with more jack cheese. And, I baked it in my 9 x 9 ceramic dish and it was amazing. I was a little reluctant to serve it for breakfast as it might be a better lunch or dinner entree but hubby thought it was terrific. Next time I make it (and there WILL BE a next time), I'm going to follow the recipe so I'll have a comparison. But I think whatever you do, this recipe will always taste amazing! Thanks for sharing! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#19#2#All ages LOVED this recipe!! I make lots of breakfast casserole's when we travel or when having company. I have my 3 favorites that I have rotated for the last 20 plus years and occasionally try new ones. Now I have 4 favorites because this one is a definite keeper! I did exactly as the recipe called for and it turned out perfect! The suggestion about green chili's sounds wonderful and I may try that next time, but honestly it doesn't need it for flavor, it seriously was perfect as is! Thank you for sharing! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#11#0#Good recipe. Even the old boy enjoyed it
Amish Breakfast Casserole#11#1#I made this exactly as the recipe is here, with ham, for us and for a neighbor. AMAZING!! I was tempted to add salt and pepper, but really didnt need to. My husband is not a fan of casseroles, but loved this one. It is quick, easy and absolutely delicious. THANK YOU!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#3#7#Was so happy with how this recipe turned out! I needed a breakfast casserole for a girls weekend getaway & this recipe really came through! It sounded simple ( in ingredients & instruction). Big plus...ingredients were readily on hand. The only changes I made was to substitute the Swiss cheese with Pepper Jack cheese, & added a dash of granulated garlic. Chopped green chilies sounded good as well, but I didn't have any on hand...next time! The casserole was so flavorful. Everyone enjoyed it. I will definitely be making this recipe again!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#1#looking very delicious
Amish Breakfast Casserole#18#2#Super easy to make and absolutely delicious!! My husband does not like anything with cottage cheese but he didn't even know there was any in it and he had three servings!! This will be my new go to.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#2#0#When me and my friends go to the shore, we always make this recipe because everyone loves it! We just add a little green pepper to it. Great to make for a group of people.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#4#15#This is probably a good recipe but I think it would be much better if some milk was added to loosen it up.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#16#5#I made this recipe as is but I did cut it in half and it was delicious. Reading other comments I was surprised to read some of the negative comments. This was excellent and I do not know why theirs did not taste great. Oh well my opinion is this was so easy and I had all the ingredients so I did not have to go out of my house at this time. Thanks for sharing it.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#12#3#Delicious. What is the best way to freeze and then thaw out?
Amish Breakfast Casserole#8#2#My family absolutely loves this recipe! We have it every Christmas morning. It's so easy to make the night before and then I pop it in the oven in the morning before everyone wakes up. I didn't think I would like it because of the cottage cheese but it's delicious. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#11#9#I'd love to make this however I need to cut it in half and I don't see the option to do that. HELP 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#2#15#I am interested in the original unaltered recipe please. Thank you.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#18#4#I am not a big fan of cottage cheese. Is there anything you can use to replace it in the recipe?
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#14#The result is exactly like a bacon-flavored block of cheese. Can not recommend.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#3#0#@LittleDixie: Your oven might need to be recalibrated. Put an over thermometer in to test what your actual temperature in there is and then you can adjust your temp accordingly.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#4#0#Great breakfast for everyone!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#1#I have used this recipe for years! I always mix it together on Christmas Eve and just pop it in the oven Christmas morning. I love to add a small can or two of hatch chiles! I mention it on my blog here: www.maternitydessert.com
Amish Breakfast Casserole#2#0#This was a delicious casserole! We liked it so well, we ate it for breakfast, then had leftovers for supper! I subbed ham for the bacon and added some bell peppers. So good! Even the hubby was raving about it! Lol
Amish Breakfast Casserole#3#0#This is a great recipe for the holiday's. I use bacon, Italian sausage

Amish Breakfast Casserole#5#2#I have made this several times. My family loves it. It also reheat and freezes well. I've made it with different kinds of meat and cheeses. Very easy to make. I've made it where I prepared it and baked it right away, and I've made it where I prepared it put in the refrigerator and baked it the next morning. Both ways are great.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#1#I've made this same recipe but use a roll of sausage instead of bacon. And I use shredded mozzarella cheese instead of cottage cheese. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#This was great. I did add salt and pepper and reserved some of the cheese for the top.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#3#2#My family and friends love this recipe. It's easy to make and versatile. Sometimes I use ham or sausage instead or add veggies like peppers or change out the kinds of cheese. Just depends on what's in my refrigerator. Its a go to favorite recipe to bring somewhere or eat at home. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#2#0#Before I retired I frequently add this casserole for a morning treat for my coworkers and occasionally sent it with my hubby to his job! Everyone loves it even folks who cringe when you mention cottage cheese! It really does just melt right in. I usually use build pork sausage like Jimmy Dean because you can get it together without the mess of cooking up bacon! And I increase the amounts of most everything when taking to a group...exact amounts have never seemed to be too important...the outcome is always great! Like some others commenting, I've frequently added diced sweet peppers. I also make a smaller version in a skillet and bake that for just us at home! Try this one, I'm sure it will become one of your faves too!

Amish Breakfast Casserole#9#2#Found this under the title of Farmers' Casserole and have been making it every two days for just over two weeks and have made some changes. Use a slightly larger casserole dish and do NOT use frozen anything. When the recipe states 3/4 cup - use 1 full cup and no need to let it sit overnight prior to placing in the oven. Also, the time it takes is tricky because it will depend on the ingredients used along with the size of the casserole dish. We will place (lightly) a sheet of aluminum foil over the top for the first 30 minutes so it won't crust over too badly. PLUS, the seasonings need to be adjusted according to your family's tastes. BUEN PROVECHO 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#Delicious! The only thing I changed was using pork sausage instead of bacon. Everyone had seconds.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#1#Prepared evening before then baked in morning. Used sausage , onion and green pepper, instead of bacon, added tsp salt and pepper. Turned out great.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#3#0#This is our all-time favorite breakfast casserole. I've been making it for years. You can add any kinds of cheeses, any kind of meat or vegetables. We like using 3c potatoes instead of 4, and Gruyere instead of Swiss cheese. Thanks for sharing! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This is great, I used ham (pre-cooked)
Amish Breakfast Casserole#5#0#Excellent breakfast casserole. I added green pepper and a little garlic to it. Also served it with salsa and sour cream. This freezes well too. I divided into two pans, baked one and froze the other.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#10#1#This was awesome! I've been looking for a great breakfast casserole for years - and this is truly wonderful. I made it initially for a weekly teacher breakfast at my school. I thought I had made too much - instead everyone gobbled it up and there was none left! My only complaint is that I found it to be just a little bland. (The recipe calls for no additional spices...which I thought was sort of odd.) I browned the hash browns (which takes forever, good lord), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. (I made it the night before and then baked it in the morning before I left for work - this also turned out quite well!) The second time I made it (tonight), I added a lot of salt and pepper to the eggs and the overall mixture. I also added some truly excellent hot sauce my husband and I love to the eggs and into the whole mixture. (Just a few dribbles.) I basically added blindly. It turned out SO WELL. Just gave it enough heat to be interesting, but not overpowering. My hot sauce is not for the faint of heart...so if you're using something less insane like Frank's or Sriracha, you made need more. Additionally, my Swiss cheese bag was 1 1/2 cups...I figured extra cheese makes everyone happier, and I just added all of it. :D I think there's a lot of wiggle room to make it however it makes you happy. But seriously: MAKE THIS. IT'S DA BOMB. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#3#1#Followed the recipe to a T and 8 people devoured this. Very easy to put together, which I did the day before and baked in the morning. Not great on the waste line, but a definite keeper!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#7#0#Delicious! Next time I might try using sausage instead of bacon and adding green chilies... or maybe not as it was good just the way it was. Definitely a winner!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#6#4#Ive made this numerous times with 4% cottage cheese and even 2% and it still tasted both great! My father in law and husband who are not fans of cottage cheese LOVED it and wouldn't have even known there was cottage cheese in there. I have also used part skim cheese and it didn't make a significant difference just to make recipe lighter. I had a bag of potatoes to use up one time and chopped them into chunks and boiled them, drained, and used the recipe as is and they were delicious if you are looking to not use the frozen bag ones.Both ways are phenomenal but the skim substitutes makes per serving a bit lighter for those who are not looking for those who are watching their waist line =) excellent recipe and is a go to when I have a huge brunch and family visiting in town! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#8#0#Huge hit with my family. Super easy to throw together. Have made many different variations with this recipe. Spicey sausage, monteray jack cheese instead of swiss cheese and added a small jar of salsa for a delicious mexican twist. Meat lovers style, with half of a pound of each, sausage, bacon and ham, and veggy with sauteed red and yellow peppers, spinach, onion and mushrooms with sliced tomatoes on top. All fantastic!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#One of my favorite go-to recipes.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#4#0#I make this for special holiday brunches. My family loves it!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#Easy to prepare and really enjoyed the taste and texture. I added ham cubes and parsle instead of bacon. The hash brown weren't totally thawed so I needed to bake it an additional 10 minutes. Next time I want to add asparagus or spinach for added flavor and nutritional value. Will be part of my Family recipe cookbook! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#2#0#I save bacon grease, so instead of using a pound of bacon, I saute the onions in approximately 3TBS of bacon grease and add a pack of the store bought diced ham. I follow the rest of the directions. The ba on grease gives it a little bacon taste and the ham makes it seem meatier.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#4#0#Good one
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#very easy, quick and tasty. I used sausage instead of bacon, a real family hit!!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#2#5#Not many recipes have 258 reviews! I made this for supper for my adult son and I the other night. I had read a lot of the reviews and also checked out other recipe sites online for the same recipe title. I used a dozen eggs and roughly chopped half a container of fresh, sliced mushrooms from Costco - which I fried with the onions - in the same pan as I had fried the bacon (I used low sodium), separately. I added a generous amount of freshly ground pepper (my son loves it) but didn't add salt as I felt the bacon and the cheese would provide enough. Seeing as I hadn't made this before I didn't make any other changes - unusual for me. It was a wholesome meal! I accompanied it with a dish of stewed, herb and spice whole tomatoes - but will use vine ripened local ones when they are available - I might even fry fresh tomato halves in the leftover bacon drippings. I will also serve it with a variety of relish and chutney recipes I make. Another reviewer's comment about using salsa is an option. Before warming the leftovers my son asked me to ramp up the flavour so I sprinkled some cayenne and garlic powder on the top and then added a layer of shredded cheddar cheese. I was pleased with the result (I don't like food as hot/spicy as my son), and my son thought it was an improvement. He wants me to make another one next week mixing the cayenne and garlic into the mixture before putting it in the casserole dish - adding a bit more of both than I'd put on the one I reheated. Obviously a personal preference. He also wants me to substitute half the hash browns for thawed mixed veggies. I'll also add the whole 500g container of cottage cheese (that's 1/2 cup more than in this recipe), as we both love cheese. Really pleased to find this recipe - thanks Beth Notaro for sharing! It reminds me of an Old Order Mennonite friend I had who died too early a few years ago with cancer. I'm sure that association added to my enjoyment of this casserole. I'm sure I'll be making this countless times with numerous variations - as well as ones close to the original. I like the idea that it's bread and gluten free as I have friends who are conscious of needing to avoid gluten. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#I've made this several times and it's always a hit.I use bulk sausage in place of the bacon. Just my preference.Definitely one of my favorite go to recipes for an easy and tasty breakfast or brunch dish.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#We made this for our guests on Christmas morning. A HUGE hit, even for the picky eaters! We also crave it for lunch and dinner now. :)
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#Made this for a church pot luck and brought home an empty dish. I did use hot sausage instead of bacon and liked the flavor it added.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#5#0#Fantastic! I use this for Holiday breakfast time when family comes over. I make it up the night before and it's so easy for morning. I add some additional ingredients like mushrooms and green peppers. Everyone enjoys! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#I make this several times a year, I bring it to staff breakfasts at my school as well. Always a hit.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#Yummy! I'd make it again.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Used sausage instead of bacon, added 1/2 cup milk, 2 minced garlic cloves and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Very good.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Very good, will make again for sure.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Family enjoyed it!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#It was ok, not bad but not super.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#4#0#Made this on a beach trip. Used potatoes o'brien, and added mushrooms, used shredded bacon cheddar cheese and sharp cheddar. This was fantastic! So many different things you could add. Loved it! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#2#0#I made this as the recipe directed (except I prepared my bacon on a sheet pan in the oven and then added it along with drippings to the skillet with onion), and it was delicious. The first batch went to the kids at church, so my own family requested a batch for home. Simple to prepare. Hearty and Satisfying.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#3#0#I made this with ham and green chilis so my husband could grab a scoop and heat it up quick before heading off to work in the mornings. He loved it and thought the recipe deserved 4 and a half stars. He said he left the half star off because there might be a little too much cheese. Will try with bacon and less cheese next time!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#2#0#Is there a substitute for the cottage cheese? I'm not too fond of the texture of cottage cheese. This recipe sounds great otherwise. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#2#Served this for guests and everyone enjoyed it. I used hot turkey sausage instead of bacon and Monterey Jack cheese instead of Swiss. I seasoned the eggs and threw in some red bell pepper because I had it on hand. I made it the day before and did not thaw the hash browns per another reviewer's suggestion. Worked great. Next time I'll add some diced green chiles or hot peppers to spice it up a bit more. Really good! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this for Saturday dinner and my son and I like it. I substituted sausage for bacon. The next time I think I might add green pepper. Definitely a keeper.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this and it was a huge hit. Substituted sausage for bacon since I didn't have bacon. Added chopped up red pepper instead of onions as well. Served with homemade biscuits and fruit. Will make again. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I like recipes where I have all the ingredients so tasty and easy to fix .and a family that finds eggs a problem enjoyed every bite of this and when we're having this again! Next Saturday when we will have guest. Thanks for this breakfast recipe~~Rosemary 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Recently made this one; it was very good. Will definitely make again.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#The whole family loves this! When I've brought this dish for potluck gatherings, literally EVERYONE asks for the recipe. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This is one of our favorite recipes. We like it with ham...good way to use leftovers. I'm going to do what one other reviewer did, and try ricotta cheese this time, since I have some I need to use. Thanks for recipe. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Very delicious. I cut the recipie in half and used an 8X8 baking dish. I assembled it the night before and popped it in the oven this morning.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Cooking 1 pound of bacon and a medium onion together does not work. Onion burns before the bacon is crisp (on medium heat). Do them separately or start the bacon well before adding the onion!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#My mom has made this for years and is the go to recipe when all of the family is over for breakfast! EXCELLENT!! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I used to make this several years ago. We really enjoyed it.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#A definite keeper! I've made this for gatherings of both family and friends. This recipe is HIT and I make it just as the recipe identifies. Guests always ask for the recipe. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#1#I have two breakfast casseroles that I traditionally make and this one is hands down the favorite. Based on the good reviews, I used my Sunday School class as guinea pigs and made this recipe because it is enough to feed a group. There was not one bite left and many request for the recipe. I did put together the casserole the day before and took it out the next morning to bake. I needed about 5 minutes more baking time (45 minutes total). Also, based on some of the other reviewers suggestions I added a small can of diced green chiles which added perfect flavor. Overall this dish is a winner.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#2#0#I thought the mixture looked dry for an egg casserole so I added 1/4 cup of milk. DON'T DO IT. I had to bake it longer because of the extra moisture. Follow the directions. It tasted excellent! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This breakfast casserole was delicious. I cooked it in the cast iron skillet I cooked the bacon in. Then served it with sliced avocado and tomatoes.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#2#0#This sounds wonderful. Does anyone know if it can be put together and then frozen for later use?
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#I have made this several times, and it is so good. I took it to an Easter brunch we had at church, and there wasn't even a crumb left! I got asked for the recipe a lot.I agree with andreasmom2u, Mary needs to make the recipe before commenting. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#1#Mary, did you even make this?! It sounds like you didn't based on your comment. If that's the case, you have no right reviewing it. This is a wonderful breakfast treat. Please keep your negativity and baseless commentary to yourself. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#3#This sounds good but way too many fat calories from the cheese.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#This was great! I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Yummy, everyone except my daughter enjoyed it, but she hates almost everything.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#Made with sausage instead of bacon. Did not thaw hash browns and made the night before. Refrigerated overnight. Very good!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#2#0#Would like to cook in crockpot. Any idea how long to cook ?
Amish Breakfast Casserole#2#0#Everybody loves this recipe! I don't thaw the hash browns if making the night before. I just mix as instructed and put in the refrigerator. Since everything is cold I add 10 more minutes to baking time. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#So simple and tasty!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#4#0#would prefer that people not preach their own opinions that refer to ingredients. all can read the recipe and understand and decide if it's to their liking. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Very good. I added green chili's as well, and it was awesome.I think the negative people are real downers and takes away from the fun of this site. Please everyone.....be positive. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#My grandsons love this casserole. I have to make 2 for the 6 boys! Always a hit! I use 1 1/2 pound drained sausage, and a dozen eggs for each casserole and more cheese and potatoes. One casserole doesn't feed a dozen people. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Used sausage instead of bacon. Added mushrooms and green peppers. Love this recipe!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#2#It looks good, but I can't have the cheese. Why does everything have to have cheese? What can I use in place of it? 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Really great breakfast dish! I like to add green chilies along with some salt and pepper.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Added green chilis and chopped red pepper. It turned out really good!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#I enjoyed this casserole and served it for Easter breakfast at my house. We really liked the combination of the cheddar and Swiss cheeses. I did add some seasoned salt and pepper to taste, as I thought it needed some seasoning.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#3#I followed this recipe exactly and would never made this dish again. Everyone who tried it thought it was missing something and I agreed. Maybe green peppers or ground mustard?
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#The best ever! I add bacon and sausage this morning with onion and peppers. I used Jalepeno cheese and cheddar! Very moist too. A must try if you haven't! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Easy casserole to make and excellent flavor.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#2#0#Changed this up just a tiny bit. Used 8 eggs, 6 cups hash browns and diced ham instead of the bacon. It was a huge hit for the guys at the cabin - nice hearty breakfast before a day of snowmobiling in Wisconsin's north woods! And the leftovers were terrific the next morning. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Delicious! I made 2 dishes of this, one with ham and one with sausage. Added a couple extra eggs to one dish. Next time I make this I will also add a couple extra egg giving the dish a little more fluff.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Delicious!! I added a handful of diced ham along with the bacon- just because. Really liked the hash brown base. Quick and easy to prepare. The family loved it- multiple requests to for the recipe. Will definitely make this again!!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I prepare breakfast for 12-16 Methodist fellows once a month, and this particular recipe is their favorite. It contains all the ingredients in one place!!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This is the best breakfast casserole I have ever made. I cut into 15 pieces and freeze. Thaw in refrigerator the number of squares you want overnight, heat in microwave and you have a quick week day breakfast. Great served with grits and toast.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I just have a question about this recipe. It looks really yummy. Has anyone made this exactly how the recipe say's the night before baking? And if so, did it turn out good? 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this recipe for a church event and it was gone in minutes. There was another breakfast casserole dish next to it and mine was gone way before the other! I used browned breakfast sausage and 12 eggs. I didn't have Swiss cheese so I didn't use it and truth be told, we didn't miss it. I think the extra cheese would have made it too rich and greasy. I baked for 1 hour 15 minutes in my oven (likely due to the extra eggs). The addition of cottage cheese was an unexpected surprise, but I didn't even notice it was there. If anything, it added moisture to the dish so that it would not be too dry. This is a great gluten-free recipe to breakfast casseroles that use bread. I also prepped this dish in a pan and let it sit overnight before baking in the morning. Next time, I might add a small can of green chiles to the mix. This will be my go-to recipe for breakfast casserole! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#I loved this recipe. I substitued sage sausage for the bacon and it was a big hit. I think it could pass as a side dish for any meal.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Made this last night for my husband and me. We both thought it was just OK. Way too cheesy. If I make it again I would definitely cut the cottage cheese in half as we felt it was overwhelming and cut back a bit on the other cheeses as well. Although the recipe calls for quite a bit of bacon we felt the dish could've used more. Maybe next time I'll substitute chopped link sausages for more substance. Not sure the potatoes add much to the dish. But, overall, a good basic recipe that can be improved with a few tweaks so I'm glad I tried it. Thanks for sharing. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I have been making this recipe for years. Everybody loves it. I always make it without the meat for those darn vegetarians in our lives! Meat on the side for the rest of us. Always a hit!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I used a four cheese Mexican blend and cubed turkey ham instead and it went over big time. It is good.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#2#Have made this numerous times in my home and everyone loves it. I fry up country sausage and onion, make the bacon in the microwave so it's not so greasy, and I place the sausage and onion mixture at the bottom of the pan and add the rest on top. To die for! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Finally, a recipe that doesn't have a lot of hot spices added to it. I go to an Amish town in Missouri and enjoy food that has natural seasoning and taste without all the spices. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Used bacon, ham, and SW hash browns. Fabulous.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#1#With this many positive reviews (and yayyy, I'm 200!), I felt like this was a no-brainer to try. It was delicious....easy to throw together, hearty and simple to tweak. I am having a bunch of summer guests staying with us, and I plan to make this a staple breakfast dish. THANK YOU for sharing! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this for a family brunch and everyone loved it!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#This recipe is a keeper the newest addition to my recipe file. Today is the first time I had tried this casserole; our cousin was dropping off some papers when she got to the door & she wanted to know what smelled so good. I invited her to come on in & eat; she said my husband & brother are with me; I said there is plenty tell them to come in too...Makes alot!!! Recipe is not dry; moist & is the perfect breakfast or lunch!!!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Used both sausage and bacon. Delicious.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this casserole for supper per the recipe & it was wonderful. If you love bacon and hash browns this is the meal. I did end up baking it for about 55 minutes since I felt like it might not be done in the middle (knife wasn't coming out clean). Served with mixed fruit and bagels. Will definitely be making again. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I only used half the onion and added other veggies - mushrooms, tomato, green pepper, etc. (drain excess water after cooking). I also sprinkled with pepper as well. Everyone loved it!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Good stuff for breakfast
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Good, easy...good staple for a morning brunch.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This is a good dish for breakfast or brunch. I used potatoes that I shredded myself and left out the Swiss cheese. It turned out delicious.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Great recipe! I added chopped up broccoli , sausage and pepperoni slices. Great flavor!I have made this twice and my husband loved it. Makes for great leftovers too!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#2#This is a great recipe. I added diced green chili's. But don't think it originated with the Amish as they don't have electricity to keep frozen hash browns. They live very frugally without electricity. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#OK Easy to make. Not a strong flavor. Bacon was a nice change from sausage but maybe could use some vegetable .
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Made exactly as written. This was amazing!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Really good! Didnt add cottage cheese for personal preferences and turn out amazing. made for 7 and had no leftovers!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this this morning but halved the recipe since I didn't have the exact ingredients. I browned the onions,bacon, and added red and green peppers. I used 6oz of leftover Sour Cream and Onion Dip (the one in the container. I didn't have cottage cheese) and added a little extra cheddar cheese to sub for not having the Swiss. It came out excellent!! Very flavorful using the dip mix. It was even better baking it in my cast iron pan- nicely browned on the bottom. This will be in our breakfast rotation! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This is a Christmas brunch dish which is always on my menu...delicious! It is super simple to assemble the night before and just pop in the oven to bake on Christmas morning. My six sons and their Dad all love it!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This is so tasty. The last time I made this, I used breakfast sausage, and I really prefer it with bacon. I like the fact that it doesn't have to sit overnight in the fridge. When I have a crowd for breakfast , this is the casserole that I make. The whole family loves it. I prefer this to the one that doesn't include the cottage cheese. One piece makes you want more. Addicting! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Really great! Made a few substitutions due to what I had on hand. Used both bacon and crumbled sausage, frozen diced onion and peppers, and Monterey Jack for the swiss cheese. Omitted the cottage cheese, not my favorite and a few dashes of hot sauce. Will be my go to casserole for any meal or that special breakfast/brunch. Thank you!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Great casserole & loved every bit of it. For the one/s who said this was tasteless, maybe you don't know how to cook, so you should start taking cooking class 101!!! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Very bland.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#The whole family loves this casserole. Nice for when you have a houseful for breakfast. Very easy to make and I like the fact you don't have to let it sit overnight. I've made it with bacon several times now. Next time, may try with sausage. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#1#I made this breakfast casserole for a staff breakfast at work. It was super easy to make. I prepped the bacon and onions the night before and then threw the rest together and baked it in the morning before work. Everybody loved it and a few people asked for the recipe. It literally disappeared within a few minutes. No leftovers!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this for Easter Brunch. It definitely deserves 5 stars!! It fed a crowd. Adults and children ate it all. I did not have cottage cheese on hand but used Ricotta cheese which I did have on hand. It would have been a little more moist if I had used cottage cheese which I will do next time. I put it together the day before and refrigerated it overnight. Perfect. Great Recipe!! Delicious. This will be my go to breakfast casserole (to serve alongside Pillsbury's French Toast Bake Casserole and a Virginia baked ham). 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Didn't have bacon on hand so I made the recipe with 1 tube of Jimmy Dean sausage but followed the rest of the recipe exactly... The ladies at church now know exactly what they will assign me to bring to brunch from now on!! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I always make this recipe for Easter Sunday breakfast! I love it!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Easy and delicious... great if you're feeding many! For two, we had leftovers for a few days (and didn't get sick of it!) 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I make this every Easter and every bit of it goes. So good! I prep it the night before and toss it in a pan on Easter morning, couldn't be easier. I use sausage sometimes to switch it up. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This was good and a nice change but I felt it needed a bit more flavor for my tastes. I liked that it used potatoes instread of bread. I did add ground pepper but felt it still needed something else. I will try it again but next time will try some of the other suggestions like pepper jack cheese instead of swisss and/or southwest potatoes instead of plain potatoes and/or the addition of sautéed peppers and garlic. This is just a personal preference for something with a little more kick . 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Really yummy, especially with breakfast sausage. I was worried there wouldn't be enough flavor but there totally was! I sprinkled pepper in it and used mozzarella instead of Swiss cheese just because I'm not the biggest fan of Swiss cheese. This would also be a really easy recipe to halve! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Yummy and easy. It was the perfect size to feed a large group. This will be served at our home!!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This is a wonderful breakfast casserole. I make this up in several small pans and then send one to our daughter in college. She loves it, even rewarmed.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This is the best breakfast casserole I've ever made or eaten. I take it to our monthly birthday parties at work and get lots of raves and asking for the recipe. I use sausage and add more eggs than what it calls for. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#this was the best b'fast casserole we have had, very good! I added pepper and also some hot sauce to it, awesome! :D 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#1#Made this for Xmas breakfast. It was the most tasteless breakfast casserole I have ever made.Glad I also made biscuits and sausage gravy. I had 3/4 that I had to throw in the garbage. Would not recommend at all. Too many other great breakfast casserole's available. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Our family really enjoys this breakfast dish. It is so much better than those that are based on bread and you don't have to wait with it in the fridge overnight. I used pork sausage instead of bacon. But like both. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this over the holiday and guests really liked it. I thought it was too rich with all the bacon and cheese. Next time I'd probably half the bacon and increase the amount of hash browns in the recipe. I also used 2% cottage cheese. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I first made this for guests. They loved it and wanted the recipe. We like it as well and have made it again. It's a great company breakfast casserole. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This is an amazing & easy-to-make casserole...I always prepare it on Christmas Eve and throw it in the oven Christmas morning!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Excellent! The entire family loved it!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Excellent!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Had a small group and halved the recipe and it was still so yummy! I used cubed hashbrowns because that's what I had on hand. Had to cook it @ 375 for the last 10mins to get it to finish. Great dish for groups big and small! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This was awesome. Only substituted mozzarella for the Swiss because we don't really like Swiss. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This was awesome! We don't really like Swiss cheese, so I substituted mozzarella though. :) 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this recipe for a brunch held after my 40th high school reunion for our committee. I made 2 and their was not a crumb left plus several classmates requested the recipe!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Love this! Make it for work all the time because it works for those needing gluten free :-) always takes longer to cook then this says though
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#My family loves this!!! We've even had it for dinner!!! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Although this is a great recipe on it's own, I've sauteed bell peppers w/the onions and added green chilis. Just gives it a little extra kick. I rate the original recipe very highly. Everyone loves it! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This recipe is so easy & delicious and the left overs were just as tasty reheated. This recipe is awesome as is but next time I make this I want to try fresh mushrooms & maybe some green pepper.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Awesome!!!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this for a Mother's Day breakfast for my family. Instead of bacon, I used a hamsteak. It was very good. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Very yummy and easy to make. Will definitely make again.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Very tasty! Would definitely make again and again and again.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this for Easter. Assembled everything Saturday night and left it in the fridge, and threw it in the oven for 45 mins on Sunday morning. So good! I used a pound of lunch meat ham instead of bacon, and added chopped mushrooms as well. Very good!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Quick, yummy, and my kids even ate it!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#My favorite breakfast casserole by far. I usually make it with 1lb of Bob Evans sausage instead of the bacon because I keep it frozen. One of our favorites.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Everybody loved it on a RV trip. So much, that I wouldn't count on serving 12, more like 6. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Made recipe as is but used more eggs for pot luck. Made it healthier for myself using shreddred summer squash in place of potatoes and was excellent & none knew the difference.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This is a great casserole for breakfast or any other meal! It lends itself to being very adaptable. I used pepperjack and a little less cheese also. I have tried it with spicy Italian sausage and another time with diced Polish Kielbasa. Always rave reviews from the peanut gallery!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This is my go to recipe when I am having overnight guests! Love it! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#My family loved it.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Easy and delicious!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Tasty and easy to create but somewhat bland. I will definitely make it again adding green & red peppers, perhaps black olives. My son added salsa as a topping saying it was perfect.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This was good but can use improving - I used 8 eggs, didn't have swiss cheese so used some sour cream, added salt (and it still needed some when I served it!). Very good idea and you can definitely play with the recipe, add ingredients that you like! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Excellent. Always goes fast.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made some changes due to suggestions from other reviewers. I used 9 eggs instead of 6. I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese because I really dislike cottage cheese. My potatoes were added frozen because I did not notice that the recipe said thawed. The casserole was very, very dry. I assume it was because I added too many eggs. The flavor was good and I will try this recipe again only this time I will not make any changes to the original recipe.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Made this for company breakfast and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. Making it today again... So easy and I think I cut back slightly on fat and it was still good... A definite keeper!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This was so easy to make and everyone in my family loved it!! This casserold will be a mainstay in my family for many years.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#this was great! I would add a couple more eggs but even without doing that this was great as in!! It was all gone with no leftovers!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#MY husband really liked this. Used Sasuage & added a dash of Cayenne pepper. Will try pepper jack next time. We like kick
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I have been using this recipe from TOH for years and we still love it. I do change it up sometimes...sausage instead of bacon, add green chilies, different cheese...it's always great. I do always have to bake it a little longer than called for, and I let it stand a little longer than called for also...if we can wait that long to dig in it! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#Although this recipe was great as is, I added 2 more eggs and substituted smoked gouda cheese for the Swiss and that really put it over the top!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Didn't have Swiss, so just used cheddar and added green peppers. Very tasty. All the kids and hubby liked it. We made it for supper with a little left over. The kids want the left overs for breakfast. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#1#This is the recipe that I use to feed a hungry crowd.When I made it the first time, I followed the recipe to the letter. It was wonderful.Over time the only changes that I make is that I use 9 eggs instead of just 6. I have also made it using breakfast sausage in place of the bacon. I imagine it would be good with ham too. YUM!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Way to much cheese, to little eggs, only 2 out 10 people finished it.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#easy and great tasting and the kids all like it!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#1#I made it first time the way the recipe suggests for a breakfast with my son and grandchildren. It was well received. The basic rescipe lends itself to variations of your choice so I've used smoke cured Ham, bulk breakfast sausage, smoked sausages, and even crabmeat and shrimp. I added fresh sliced mushrooms, red bellpeppers, and even the long green chile peppers seeded and diced small. I made fresh salsa with Cilantro and served it on the side. Ialso made fresh biscuits with butter and honey and a fresh fruit or melon. Great breakfast. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Simply delicious!!! Have made this several times and it's always a huge hit! I always add extra meat - sausage and canadian bacon. I NEVER have leftovers! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#Made this for a family brunch and divided into 2 pans (1 w/bacon and 1 without for a vegetarian) and both were a big hit. I followed various people's suggestions, substituted cottage cheese with ricotta and used half mexican cheese and half mexican cheese with taco seasoning for a little kick. Very easy to make and yummy! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this for breakfast for the 4th of July, and it was fantastic. It was super easy and really enjoyable. I did make one substitution. I don't like cottage cheese, I don't even like the idea of cottage cheese, so I used ricotta cheese instead and it was perfect. This is a recipe to keep!! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#It was alright. My husband did not really like it but he liked that it kept him full for a long time.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I put my own spin on this recipe. I didn't use the bacon but instead use ham and added mushrooms and used cheddar cheese. I made it for company and everyone enjoyed. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this for an employee breakfast at work today and it was HIT!!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Made this for some company and it was a big hit. Even though I cooked it for the full time and let it stand before serving, the very center had not set up fully. But that won't stop me from serving this dish regularly. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I've made this recipe several times. Each time I have omitted the onion and replaced the bacon with sausage. It's always a hit. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this for our LWML breakfast meeting and it was a great hit - any leftovers freeze well....
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Wow! This is an awesome recipe!I cut it in half, substituted feta for the cheddar and hot pork sausage for the bacon. Since there are only 3 in my family, that gave me a meal for one breakfast and I froze the other half for another morning. This is SO easy and my hubby who doesn't really care for casseroles for breakfast said it was a keeper . 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This is soooooooooooo good
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#My husband liked the recipe. I used ham slices that I had. It was good.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I followed the recipe exactly as stated. It baked to a lovely golden brown. I served today to teachers at a Staff Appreciation Brunch. They loved it and I brought home an empty container less than an hour later. I've added this to my go to list of recipes. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#My son-in-law says he hates cottage cheese, but he declared this recipe A keeper . Because I was feeding a crowd, I added a few more eggs, a pound of Lil Smokie links sliced (yes, I also added the bacon as directed) and switched the cheddar and swiss for a combo of cheeses we had on hand. I liked the kick the pepper jack cheese gave it. Hearty and delish! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This recipe is tasty and easy to make. I gave it 4 stars as it could be considered a little bland. Next time, I'm going to try pepperjack instead of swiss.All in all, I liked it and would not hesitate to make this dish again! Thanks for the recipe! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This recipe is tasty and easy to make. I gave it 4 stars as it could be considered a little bland. Next time, I'm going to try pepperjack instead of swiss.All in all, I liked it and would not hesitate to make this dish again! Thanks for the recipe! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Quick, simple and delicious!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#My family LOVES this casserole! I had to alter it a bit for my large family. I use 8-12 eggs, use pepper jack cheese instead of swiss and add a couple spoonfuls of sour cream. I also substitute sausage when i didn't have bacon, and it was just as delicious. This adds to my cooking time, approximately 50-60 minutes total but it is worth the wait. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Absolutely delicious! A family favourite.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#i made breakfast for dinner and the entire casserole was eaten! everyone had seconds.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made it without the bacon (I didn't have any) and it was still fabulous! Great recipe - thanks! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this recipe for family visiting from out of town and it was a hit. They took the recipe home and used it for a family gathering over Christmas...everyone wanted the recipe! Easy recipe and excellent tasting.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I blended the cottage cheese and eggs (8 eggs) in a blender and added 1/4th cup of milk. I also substituted cubed ham for the bacon. I sauteed up a yellow onion and mushrooms to add. I omitted the swiss cheese. I also added salt, pepper, ground mustard, and garlic powder. This was supper yummy. My husband likes to eat this with salsa. Would be okay with ketchup for kids.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This recipe was easy to make and tasty, however I found it very bland. I was worried when preparing it that it would be, but wasn't sure if the saltiness of the bacon would be enough, so I didn't alter the recipe except to make it with 10 eggs. After eating it, I would definitely add salt and pepper, and maybe even some green and red peppers. It has the potential to be a wonderful recipe. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This recipe is ok, but I have another similar recipe we like much better. I think the hashed browns make this a little heavy.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Trust me, you don't taste the cottage cheese.  My son and husband can't stand cottage cheese, but they don't even know it's in the recipe.  I am so craving this recipe now too. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#enjoyed the cottage cheese, made it creamy! easy to make and I used turkey sausage vs. bacon.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#1#made this for Christmas Eve brunch 2011 everyone said it was delicious..next year I will make (2) 9x13's because it was gone so fast after people took seconds and thirds!!! I didn't change anything in the recipe, however, I did make it the day before, covered it and put it in the refrigerator. I took it out 30 minutes before I baked it. It is a keeper and the only breakfast Casserole I will make from now on. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I am eating this as I speak. It is really good, flavorful. I added chopped ham instead of bacon and I had a block of Irish Cheddar so I used that instead of the standard orange. Other than that, the recipe is the same. Oh, and I added a little bit of green onions along with the sweet. The cottage cheese makes it creamy and delicious. Excellent brunch dish
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Delicious! I have never made a breakfast casserole before because none of the other recipes appealed to me. This one was a big hit for a holiday breakfast.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#We have tried this with bacon and sausage and enjoyed both.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This was kind of boring by itself, but a good standard to add green chilies and spices. Could probably also use only one cheese.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Made this again this morning! Absolutely LOVE it! I double the eggs, 12 total and sauté red and green pepper to throw in it! Delicious!!!! We even eat it for dinner too!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This was soooo good and easy. I took it to work and everyone loved it! I followed the recipe except I did put 10 eggs. Next time I think I will add green pepper and mushrooms. You can't taste the cottage cheese but don't leave it out...I think it inhances the taste of the other cheeses. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Delicious! Kids and adults alike loved it!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this last year for Christmas Breakfast and all my family loved it! I cooked the bacon and onion mix the night before and put it in a sealed bowl till the morning and was perfect to mix the last bit and pop in the oven while presents were being opened! It has been requested for a repeat Christmas Breakfast again this year!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Excellent! Everybody wanted more!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Really good and easy too. I used a combo of bacon and sausage that worked out well.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Delicious!!! Made with 12 eggs and turkey sausage. A very easy and cheap meal that the entire family will enjoy! Also, for those who don't like cottage cheese, you can't taste it in this dish a bit! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#After I made this recipe I have'nt even triedanother one. This is a keeper! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Made this when I had family in from out of town and every on loved it. So much they asked for a copy of the recipe.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#Yummy! And for Grampa, who doesn't like cottage cheese, you won't notice it if you put it in a blender with the eggs.I've changed the recipe by using less potatoes (hubby can't eat a lot of carbs!) and adding fresh spinach, mushrooms & bell peppers. It also can be spiced up lots more if that's your taste. Very adaptable recipe! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Simply Amazing! My wife and I tried this one out a few months ago, and it IMMEADIATELY became a weekly dish. a Must Try!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made the Amish Breakfast Casserole this week for friends. Everyone gave it 10/10. However cholesterol wise, it's quite a bit when you consider all the cheese. It's a great recipe for a one dish breakfast. Will do a repeat again when we have guests for breakfast of for a brunch.Ottawa, Ontario, Canada 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Lot of potatoes and potato taste in this recipe. Almost tastes like a hashbrown casserole.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This is my first time writing a review for a recipe, but this one deserved a review, it was that good. This was so tasty; I made it just as directed, except I used a pound of sausage (Bob Evans breakfast sausage). Be sure to let stand for 10 minutes, in fact, I think 15 minutes is better. I made it quicker by frying the sausage a day ahead.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Does anyone know if this can be made ahead and frozen? It is delicious and I'd like to have it in the freezer for unexpected company. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I want to make this casserole for company. Has anyone tried making it and freezing it ahead of time?
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I will make this again and again. My family and co-workers love this. A tip to make it even quicker is that I used a package of the Oscar Meyer real bacon bits you find on the Salad Dressing aisle and it was fantastic!! This is a recipe I will keep forever and so quick and easy to make!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Am so glad that you posted this as this is more than just a 5 star..everyone loves this thank you for this wonderful recipe.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I always use 12 eggs but otherwise follow this to a T, and love it! Have tried with both bacon and turkey sausage and it's great both ways! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#There are never any leftovers when I make this. It is hearty and delicious.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#I made this as a test to see if it's what I wanted to take to a bridal shower. It was great! I did follow the advice of one lady and made it with 12 eggs and 30 oz hash browns so it would be a little bigger. Being from the Southwest, you can't make an egg dish without throwing in green chili. I bought the frozen kind and drained it before adding. Since it was bigger I baked it an hour. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Easy and delicious!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this for my kids this morning and they both gave me 2 thumbs up!! Easy and delicious.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This is a great recipe! One reviewer said hers turned out dry. Gas and electric ovens don't cook the same. For anything you cook, if you're using a gas oven, lower the temp. by 15 degrees. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this for my husband the other night. He LOVED it. Instead of the cottage cheese, I added a little more shredded cheese and extra hash browns. I also cut up an extra tomato I had laying around and threw some green, orange and red peppers on tops just for color. Was soooo good! Will make it again, very soon!!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This was very tasty and relatively easy to make. Made with bacon and next time I will try the breakfast sausage.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this for our Ladies Bible Study today and everyone luved it...i did make a few changes because i needed it to make a lager casserole...i used 12 eggs instead of six..my hash-browns was a 30 oz bag..and i added extra cheddar cheese to the top when it was done and left it just long enough 2 melt...we r big on Cheddar Cheese...Was Very Good...might try it another way next time r make as recipe calls 4 . i just needed a bigger casserole this mornin...Thanks 4 sharing ..Will be making it again !!!!!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this casserole yesterday with 1 lb of breakfast sausage. It's okay, but don't think it has enough flavor that I would make it again. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#My daughter is going back to college this morning and I wanted to make something she would enjoy & get her back on the road to finish up her last year of college. We all enjoyed this very much.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Wow! This was great! I used extra-sharp cheddar cheese. My husband and kids loved it. Thank you for a great recipe I will use a lot. :)
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#We were snowed in and I made this, and it is fantastic . . . cannot wait to make it again. I used Bob Evans sausage since I had it on hand and probably used close to 5 cups of shredded hashbrowns to make it firmer. My husband and I love it, and this is our new favorite breakfast casserole now. The next time I will use bacon instead to see if it is as good.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#3#0#I have made this for Christmas morning the last two years. It is a hit. I substitue Monterey Jack for the Swiss. And I cook the bacon and onion up the night before and measure out the other ingredients in a large bowl. Basically do everything except add the eggs. I do that in the morning. I get it out a few minutes earlier and bake it a little longer. Works really well.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#very good made for faimly
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this for our Christmas morning breakfast and we really enjoyed it. Now that I've tried it once I would add some additional ingredients next time I made it. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Made this for a Bible Study Brunch and was a huge success. The potatoes are a welcomed change from bread and the cottage cheese makes it oh so creamy. Wouldn't change a thing and will definately make again. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Being I'm watching the fat intake, I found this recipe easy to defat with turkey bacon and lowfat or no fat cheeses. If you don't have frozen hash browns, shred or dice the potatoes. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I haven't tried it yet but wonder how the Amish prepared potatoes for it. I'm SURE they didn't use frozen hash browns. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#1#This recipe is delicious. To the person who would like to substitute Ricotta instead of cottage cheese, that would work fine also but since Ricotta is alot more expensive you might consider just putting your cootage cheese through a food processor or blender and your cottage cheese hater will not know the difference.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Has anyone ommited the cottage cheese and used something else? I have one in the family that if they see cottage cheese they won't use it. Would ricotta cheese work? 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I have made this for Christmas morning the last 3 years in a row. Delicious for breakfast or dinner.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I have had this recipe from Taste of Home years ago and it is a staple in my family. It feeds alot of people and everyone loves it. I use chives or scallions instead of onion.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This recipe is the same one I found in a quilters cookbook several years ago. I make it all the time. I like the sausage, but I also use Canadian bacon. It's easier and a little less fat. Give it a try. We like this recipe with pancakes. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Looked this up a few days before Christmas when seraching for breakfast idaes. We really liked this -- made it for Christmas breaksfast for the fisrt time AND it had nice presentation for guests. Very easy to make! I reduced the onion (used sweet onion) because I don't really care for onions. I will make again ~ thanks! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#My husband LOVED this dish! He said it needs to replace our annual tradition of Breakfast Pie (see other Taste of Home recipe) for Christmas breakfast.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this on Xmas Eve to serve Xmas Morning...VERY Good...It is already slotted for the menu for Xmas 2011!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This is my new favorite breakfast casserole. Great as written, or do as we do and add in other meats & veggies we have on hand. The cottage cheese in it adds creamy goodness.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Our family loves this.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I substituted sausage for the bacon and omitted the onions, and received rave reviews on Christmas morning. It's a keeper! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Everyone in the family thought it was very good. Next time will sub mozza cheese for the swiss.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Good flavor but mine turned out a little on the dry side. I think it needs a little milk.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I prepared this for our family Christmas breakfast. My family devoured it. It is so easy. I made it the night before and refrigrated it and put it in the oven to cook while we opened presents. It was great. I added cubed ham to it; it was delicious. It is now on the menu for next year.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#1#We did not enjoy this casserole. My family all agreed that our all-time favorite egg casserole by Jimmy Dean is MUCH better.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I can honestly say that I have not yet tried this recipe, but my husband and I love brunch. I am Amish decendent (Yoder) and they have the best country and simple brunch dishes.I can tell just by readind the ingredient's that I will make this dish and have created my own simular to this recipe that it is a hit! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#My family really liked this casserole. The next time I make it I want to try other veggies and meat. I think you can do a lot with this and it will always taste good.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Friends LOVED it! Used ham instead of bacon, and it was absolutely delicious!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This was delicious. I made it with ham instead of bacon since that was what I had on hand. I also used tator tots and broke them up as that was what I had. It needed to cook a bit extra as the tator tots were not completely thawed out. It made me nervous at first as it didn't seem to be setting up but I just cooked it til a knife came out clean and it turned out great! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Have been making this for years we love it. I've even used leftover spam,onion,green pepper and cheese which we use for a grilled sandwhich. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Delicious! Will make this again. I didn't have fresh onion so i used minced instead and didn't have any swiss so i used extra cheddar. MM MMM good. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Wanted to try something new for x-mas morning, we've had the same thing every year for a while. I made it early to give it a try and avery one loved it, even the kids. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I make this at least once a month, however, I've tweaked it to our liking. I use a lb of bacon AND a lb of sausage...I also make my own homemade hashbrowns and brown them with onions. We like them better if they are cooked to make them a little crunchier than the frozen ones used in the original recipe. I also put 1/2 of the mixture in the pan and then put swiss slices and the rest on top, with cheddar to cover the top...Guess you could say all I use the recipe for anymore is a list of ingredients :) But, it was awesome as it is written as well! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Loved this Recipe... My Daughter had a Birthday sleepover with 8 girls and this made enough for all of them, they loved and it was a good lower carb recipe as to one of the girls is a diabetic. Needless to say that girls mom walked out the door with this recipe too.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I've made this many times. Used ham, bacon, & hot sausage. I always use fresh potatoes. For the lady that said her potatoes were brown, all you need to do is soak them in water as soon as you take them out of food processor. It is so much cheaper this way instead of buying the frozen ones and I always have potatoes on hand. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This is the best. Wonderful flavor and so easy. Stir everything all together night before. Have tried many egg stratus and this is by far the best! Company all wanted the recipe!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Had guests for breakfast on Sunday. 6 adults ate the entire pan! I used one lb. of bulk italian sausage instead of bacon. I added two more eggs and I used the entire bag of potato's. This will become a regular dish at our house. When I shared this with a friend, she said this dish is safe for those with Celiac disease because - no bread. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I added a handful of left over italian sausage from the previous nights lasagna, omitted thw swiss cheese and used freshly shredded potatoes. It turned out a bit dark from the fresh potatos but we all really enjoyed it. There was enough for left overs the next morning which were even better!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#It's a favorite at home and church. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Excellent casserole, easy and delicious. I cook for the young adults for our Church and this is one of their favorite dishes.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#We fix this recipe often. It is great to prepare it the night before and bake it in the morning. Try this with sausage or ham! My family loves this recipe!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this recipe for a special family brunch and it was the absolute best! I used 1 1/2 pounds of sausage and 12 eggs. Instead of Swiss cheese I used a colby/jack mix. To make sure it was spicey enough I added a pinch of cayenne pepper. Even with these additions, it served only 8. This is my new favorite brunch recipe
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#I make this for brunch with the ladies. My good friend is wheat-intolerant. She loves this recipe.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This casserole was fantastic! Will try sausage next time! I don't feel this recipe is 12 servings, as stated, I feel it's more like 8 or 9! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#I made this recipe last weekend and LOVED it. I used sausage in place of bacon. This recipe will be tagged as one of our favorites.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#My husband and I made this Amish Breakfast Casserole on Valentines Day for a family breakfast brunch. Absolutely a hit! Very good the next day too!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#This is a deliious breakfast casserole. My entire family enjoyed it! I am making it again this weekend while we are snowed in! Thank you for submiting it!!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Needed something for a birthday food day at work....this was easy, delicious and everyone loved it. I highly recommend it.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#Excellent - really really good. I used kielbasa instead of bacon and it was fantastic. A hit with the entire family!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#we had 28 family members coming for breakfast on Christmas morning. So we had two different recipes to try and this one was a hit. No one had any idea cottage cheese was in it. I cooked the chopped onions with the bacon and used the freeze dried hashbrowns (just added the water and waited 10 min) and then added everything and baked. Next year we are only going to make this recipe! We added a ham, fresh fruit and a stuffed french toast casserole and everyone was happy!
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#The most delicious breakfast cassarole I've ever made. 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#0#oh my. this turned out just perfect! I made a half batch, just in case we didn't care for it, and it was GONE in no time. I've been looking for a simple breakfast recipe to serve Thanksgiving morning and this is it! I used breakfast sausage in place of the bacon and I skipped the onions on accident - still, it was just perfect. It's like a cheesy quiche meets yummy scrambled eggs. Thanks for sharing! 
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#This was delicious. I like sauteing my onions in the bacon drippings. I added chopped bell pepper and used the cheeses I had on hand (no swiss). It is an easy recipe and is easy to make changes to fit what is in your pantry.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#1#0#I love this recipe. Every time I make it I have an empty pan. I like to fry the bacon and cut the onion up the night before to cut down on prep time in the morning.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#0#2#I have made this recipe multiple times and our Ladies Sunday School Class asks for it everytime there is a ladies brunch, etc. I use a pound of real bacon bits instead of cooking up bacon, dried onion pieces can be used in place of chopped onion, I increase the eggs to 12, use 1 package of shredded hash brown potatoes (16-20 oz package from the refrigerator section), I chop up sliced swiss cheese since I can never find shredded Swiss already packaged and make no changes on the cottage cheese. This casserole is a big hit and by using some of the easier ways to get ingredients it is not hard to make. I have never tried to freeze this but since I am making one for Sunday I may try freezing a small amount to see how it holds up.
Amish Breakfast Casserole#2#0#This is one of my favorites, we are on a cooking team with four other couples at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in Wichita Kansas. Each week a team cooks breakfast every Sunday during the year. My husband and I take turns choosing what we want to fix. This is high on my list as the cottage cheese makes it so moist and delicious.I vary on the Cheddar cheese and use what I have on hand, sometimes I may add two or more different cheeses when I make a triple batch. I add different meats as well, to the casserole depending what is on sale at the store. This is always a big hit with our parish of 45 people.We charge a $2.00 donation to cover the cost of the meal and what money is over the cost goes back to the Church.

Amish Breakfast Casserole#3#0#This recipe is SOOOO good! I make it all the time for potluck breakfasts & brunches!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Delicious cupcakes! Left out the cinnamon in the frosting. I had some pumpkin cookies that I put in the food processor and sprinkled on the top of the frosted cupcakes, were amazing.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#0#Absolutely love these! We have these for every birthday now, not just in fall
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#6#0#Best cupcakes ever! I am not usually a fan of pumpkin, so I really just made these for my family....but I love them! We have now made them several times and they are delicious. The only change we make is leaving out the ginger because we thought it might be too strong in the cupcakes.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#0#This is an AMAZING recipe! I'm gonna be the hero this Thanksgiving! So so perfect in every way! That little bit of ginger is genius!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Fantastic cupcake, frosting has the taste of a cin roll. Great combination
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#5#2#These were so good. I only used 3 cups of confectioners sugar but probably could have gotten away with 2 cups and I only used 1 tsp Cinnamon in the frosting because I didn't want the cinnamon to over power it. I have frosting left over & may make another batch to give away. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#0#Very moist. Light texture. Delicious. Only fault with this recipe is that it was entirely too much frosting. Next time, I will make half as much frosting. Great recipe. Made 27 cupcakes.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#0#I think I've established a new holiday staple in our home. I used my stand mixer and followed manufacturer's guidelines on speed and length of time for mixing ingredients at each step of the way. The cupcakes came out tender and fluffy. A definite hit with my family and another family we shared with. We will definitely cook these again during pumpkin season. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#We use less sugar in the frosting also, and it's still delicious. Try with Craisins in the batter with the candied pecans on top! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#3#0#I didn't plan on baking today but I received this recipe in my email and wow, the cupcakes are amazing! They didn't rise up much but thats ok, just eat another to make up for it. I don't think I have ever baked a cake without vanilla extract and the batter recipe didn't call for it so I added some. The added vanilla made the cupcakes almost too sweet, and I love sweet but next time I won't add any, there is already some vanilla in the frosting, that is probably enough. Also, this recipe made 2 dozen cupcakes plus a small bundt cake, you could easily get 3 dozen cupcakes from this recipe. I will definitely make this recipe again, it is a keeper! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I want to make this but I want to use mini foil pans, do I need to change anything ?
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These were SOOO good. I altered one thing.. only used 2C of powdered sugar in the icing and it was plenty sweet for us. I will definitely make these again!!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#1#I think Your kitchen tip of lightly beating my cupcakes actually caused them to have zero air and therefore didn't rise. So now I have dense flat cupcakes. Not a good tip for Coloradoans Good flavor but....
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Yes, it is. I have made it at approximately 5200 feet elevation with perfect results.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Is this recipe already adjusted for altitude? Haven't tried it yet but looks good 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These were awesome. I did however, fill them with a whipped cream and vanilla pumkin spiced pudding. It just added that wow factor
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made these today. They were easy to make and the recipe was easy to follow. I am taking them to a party and I'm sure everyone will love them. I'm sure I will be making them year round. (We love pumpkin) 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made these last night..Followed the recipe completely. Didn't change a thing. They were amazing...I made them for my husband for work. They were gone quick he said. I will for sure be making these again. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#0#These are absolutely delicious. It is one of my favorite fall cakes to make. The cake has a nice spice and it's not dry. The cinnamon in the cream cheese frosting is the perfect finishing touch. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I just made these and the frosting seems awfully dense......shouldn't there be some milk or half and half mixed in with conf sugar to make it light and fluffy? 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#2#2#Hello im about to make this recipe. One question can I use regular milk instead of buttermilk?
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#0#Hi - I'm about to try these out. Do you use salted or unsalted butter?Update: Used salted butter - these are the best cupcakes I have ever cooked by far, and I'm not even a pumpkin fan! The pumpkin flavor is light and it balances so well with the cinammon cream cheese frosting! Thank you so much - I will be making these every fall for the rest of my life 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#To Mary...I used salted butter and they turned out great. I only use unsalted if it's specified in the recipe. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This recipe is absolute perfection. I brought The cupcakes to a bake sale at work and couldn't have gotten better reviews. I used powdered buttermilk, mixed in with the dry ingredients rather than liquid buttermilk, but the consistency was excellent; perfectly moist. These are perfect for Fall and I will make them over and over.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I used all organic ingredients. My husband gave these two thumbs up and said,'intense pumpkin flavor!' Next time I make them, I will add raisins to the batter, and sprinkle crushed candied pecans over the frosting. Superb cupcakes and an easy recipe! Happy Fall, y'all! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#1#So good I'm making these for my fall wedding!! Making sure the butter and cream cheese are at room temp helped ensure a silky smooth frosting. The spice level in both the frosting and the cupcake is spot on. The cupcakes have fresh, pure ingredients so they're heavier/denser than box mix cupcakes. These are on my Top 5 Cupcakes list! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These are the best!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I've made this recipe about five times and it comes out beautifully each time. I even made it for my sister's wedding and everyone loved it. The cupcakes are a little denser than a regular cupcake but i like them that way. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made these for a bake sale, and they were a huge hit!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made these a few weeks ago and have many requests for more and for the recipe. Making them this weekend for a pot luck dinner. Think I will make copies of the recipes to hand out, I know I'll be asked. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#My daughter won her cooking competition with these! They taste fantastic. Highly reccomend.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#The cupcakes and icing turned out great. I doubled the recipe but instead of using 5 cups of sugar for the cupcakes, I only used 3. It came out perfectly sweet with the 3 cups.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Awesome taste. My family loved these. I had enough left over to make a small pumpkin loaf. Next time I am going to make this as loaves instead of cupcakes.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Delicious! I've made these several times and have taken to work. Everyone raves about them and comes looking for more! My children also love them! People who don't like pumpkin have tried them and say they are awesome! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#After I submitted my review I saw it was for the Pumpkin Cupcakes and not the Pumpkin cookies!!!! So sorry! I did make these cupcakes also and they are scrumptious!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Very moist and tastey. The frosting was delicious and the added cinnamon topped it off. My boyfriend who is not even a big sweets person ate them 2 days in a row and my kids LOVED them. Even better the next day!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These are delicious!! Very moist & the icing made them-these are the best pumpkin cupcakes ever!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I have been making these for years an they are always the talk of the party. The only thing that I do different is use one big can of 29oz of pumpkin instead of 15oz and it just makes it so much more moist and more pie like.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Everyone absolutely loved them and begged me for the recipe. I made according to recipe as written.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Moist and delicious. Just as good as all the great reviews stated. I will definitely be keeping this one!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Good but not as amazing as I had hoped by the reviews.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#1#I was told by several people at my husbands work that these were the best cupcakes they have ever eaten in their life!! Very moist but yet stay together and don't fall apart. The icing was definitely a winner as well :) 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Made these today and they are wonderful. They are moist and very flavorful. Frosting taste great with the cinnamon added. Will definitely make again.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I don't normally make comments but these cupcakes were so good that I had to! The flavors all blend together well and the cupcakes are super moist. I am not a huge fan of pumpkin but I loved these. These are great cupcakes for Thanksgiving! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Very good! Made these and gave some to my neighbors. All good comments! I am so making these again. I added some sugared ginger instead of regular ginger.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing.1 tbsp of pumpkin pie spice =1 1/2 tsp cinnamon1/2 tsp ground nutmeg1/2 tsp ground ginger1/4 tsp ground cloves
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#0#I don't like pumpkin but this was absolutely amazing! I work at a restaurant and on busy weekends I take in cupcakes. I tried this and it was a winner, even I had seconds. This recipe is fantastic and I can't wait to make them again. Thank you so much for sharing! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This is the perfect autumn recipe! The cake is moist and boasts a mild pumpkin flavor that is perfectly spiced. The tang of the cream cheese frosting is mellowed with the warmth of cinnamon. The combination is divine! I made two 11X13 sheet cakes. I stacked one on top of the other with a thin layer of icing in between and a layer of frosting on top. It was devoured and all who tried it, loved it!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#4#Can't wait to try 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#0#Really good. But were a bit spongy and some didn't rise. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#LOVE LOVE LOVE
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These are the best ever!!!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Love these cupcakes, they were a hit! How long would I have to bake these in a loaf pan!?
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Love, love, love this recipe!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Just made these for Harvest Day at work. They are very tasty!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#very good and moist - love the icing!!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These were great!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These were the best! Made these for an office party and they didn't last very long. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#By far the best recipe for pumpkin cupcakes I have ever tried! I have made these for the fall season for many years and they are a favorite of my family.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I didn't try the cream cheese frosting recipe provided but instead bought the coolwhip cream cheese frosting in the freezer section. Added 1tsp cinnamon and it was so light and fluffy not overpowering sweet. Less calories and sugar. Yum! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made this cake on 10/13/13. this is one of the best cake I've had. It's very MOIST and I love it. I just change one thing and that was the ginger I added allspice instead. Love It!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Mmm Mmm GREAT!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Delicious, moist, and baked up beautifully. Gorgeous orange hue to them too. I used my own recipe for cream cheese frosting, and added a bit of maple syrup for a flavor twist. Great recipe!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These cupcakes are amazing! The only thing I changed was reducing the sugar to 2 cups. I thought 2 1/2 would be a little too sweet for my taste and I think I was right, cause they turned out perfectly sweet. I can't say enough about how good these are. The spices are spot on and I love that it calls for butter (I won't use vegetable oil or shortening). Yum! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#1#I love this recipe but I didn't actually go ingredient by ingredient. I accidentally forgot to add the canned pumpkin lol. I was ready to throw the batch out but to my surprise the cupcakes were very tasty. I even added a crumb topping to some. I did add a bit more buttermilk, cinnamon and pumpkin spice to my batch. I also omitted the ginger. I will be making this again and hopefully this time I will not forget the pumpkin. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Excellent flavor and really easy. I was able to substitute Greek yogurt for the buttermilk and my cupcakes were great and perfectly moist. I was also able to do it without an electric mixer so that's a plus! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This disappeared at our family Christmas Dinner. Easy to make (I cheated and used Whipped Cream Cheese frosting though) and very tasty. They don't puff up a lot, so fill the cups full - the cake is fairly heavy, but a good consistency. I will definitely be making these again! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Easy to make, moist, and delicious!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Believe it or not - I have purchased bad powder before.  You can test the freshness of your powder by putting a few tablespoons of warm water (warm tap water is fine, but cold water is not) into a small bowl and adding a teaspoon of baking powder. It should make a fizzing noise and then the baking powder will begin to fizz and the water will become very cloudy with tiny bubbles. The more bubbles, the fresher the baking powder. The other thing you should do is double check your oven temperature.  Oven thermometers are inexpensive and imperative to baking.  My own oven tends to run hot.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I was so eager to try this reciped for a friend who loves pumpkin spiced cupcakes. I made this recipe to the T; using all of the same ingredients, following the instructions exactly, and making sure to bake them at the right temperature and everything. I dont understand, but my cupcakes are coming out songey/mushy, and not rising at all. I dont think its the baking powder, because I just bought a new one the other day. If anyone knows why this is happening, Id really appreciate it if you could let me know ): Really sad the batter and frosting will all have to go to waste.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Fantastic cupcakes!! They were a huge hit and people keep asking me for the recipe. Instead of pumpkin pie spice i just added some extra cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. These cupcakes really taste like a pumpkin pie, not just a spice cake. Loved the frosting as well, the cinammon adds that extra special taste. Would definitely recommend trying.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made these cupcakes four time over the Thanksgiving holiday for friends and family. They are unbelieveable. Huge reviews from all. I did add more pumpkin spice and cinnamon to batter. Also added more cinnamon to frosting. Wonderful, moist and delicious. This is a keeper recipe!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These cupcakes have rave reviews for a reason, they are amazing. You won't regret it if you try them! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#simple and delicious! The spiced frosting was the star of these cupcakes. I topped mine with a few slivered almonds as a nice garnish. Great recipe!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These were fantastic! Everyone who has tried them wants more than one. The recipe made 2 dozen cupcakes, but in the future think I will cut the frosting in half. There was A LOT of it left over.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Everyone loved them I'm making them again for Thanksgiving. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Not only is this recipe simple, it is absolutely fabulous. These home made cupcakes come out perfect every time, with just the right amount of spice. The are moist and delish! The icing is the perfect compliment to these tasty morsels... I will make them again and again.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I don't usually bake but stumbled across this recipe while searching for a pumpkin dessert. I live at 8K feet so cakes are a real challenge! This is delicious and easy. I followed it and added half a walnut to the tops. It made exactly 24 perfect cupcakes and the frosting was the right amount. I took them for dessert to a gathering and they were a huge hit! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#0#This is a fabulous recipe! My friend wanted a good seasonal cupcake recipe after she volunteered to bake desserts for another friend's November baby shower. I volunteered to help, and after baking a test batch, we made just a couple of alterations. For the pumpkin spice we used fresh ground cloves and nutmeg, about a tablespoon and a half total of approximately equal parts nutmeg and clove, and we increased the cinnamon by a half teaspoon.For my palate, I'd add even more spice in the future, likely the nutmeg and clove, but generally the spice level seems good for most people. I decreased the amount of sugar in the frosting by a half cup, and might even reduce it by a full cup in the future, along with adding about 1/4 cup more cream cheese. We also added about 1/2 to 3/4 of a vanilla bean (split the bean and scrape out), along with the cinnamon, which made it a really rich tasting frosting.If you have a pastry bag with decorative frosting tips you can frost them that way, and the cupcakes look professionally made, nice to take to parties and holiday events. To top them off we sprinkled finely chopped candied ginger on top of the finished frosting. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made these for a teachers luncheon and kept a dozen for my family. I haven't heard anything back yet from the teachers or PTA but the ones in my house were gone within 2 days! They are moist and taste like pumpkin pie in a wrapper! I am making again today to take to a friend who just had a baby and we will keep the rest! Yum! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Terrific recipe - think they are even better the next day! Without the frosting they make a wonderful muffin! :-)
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Wow! These are amazing! I used 1/4 C applesauce and 1/2 cup butter as opposed to 3/4 C butter. They are so moist and flavorful! Thanks for sharing!!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#The BEST dessert I've ever had! They are mouth watering and you can't just have one. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I buy a small container of buttermilk, use what I need and freeze the rest in 1 cup increments in labeled freezer bags..lay them flat til they freeze then you can stand them up for easier storage
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Using pureéd fresh pumpkin would likely alter the taste of this recipe quite a bit, if not drastically. I am a huge fan of using fresh pumpkin substitute an many pumpkin recipes though, and happy to learn someone has provided guidance to alter, thanks keverwann. But I made it with canned pumpkin exactly as written because of the raves and they turned out fabulous! Definitely a keeper here!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Followed this recipe exactly and they are AMAZING!!!!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I thought this recipe was great. I put hershey's cinnamon and premier white chips in them as well and they turned out great! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I simply loved these cupcakes. Delicious and very easy the one thing I did to improve them was add 2 tablespoons of grade A maple syrup to the frostings to kick up the fall flavors. Also to anyone having trouble with to runny frosting your butter or cream cheese was to soft!!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Yummy and so cute!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Great cupcakes! I cut the frosting in half as suggested by other users but ran out with 4 cupcakes left. I decorated the cupcakes exactly as pictured. I would suggest making a full batch of the frosting and freezing any leftovers for future baking projects. It is delicious!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#1#Worth the work!I used homemade pumpkin puree (1 3/4 cup) instead of the canned pumpkin, made my own pumpkin pie spice, and used soured milk instead of the buttermilk.I think the recipe needed a little less liquid on the day I made it, but I went against my better judgement and used all the recipe called for. Thus, the cupcakes didn't set fast enough in the oven and had hat brims of batter that cooked over the top of the liners instead of rising in a nice dome.I also made half of the frosting (as suggested by previous reviewers) and it covered all 30 (not 24 as the recipe claims) cupcakes nicely. The frosting tasted very good despite the fact that it calls for (what I think is) a lot of cinnamon.As to why frosting might not be setting up (as mentioned by Alie0717): If you make cream cheese frosting with low-fat (Neufchatel cheese) or fat-free cream cheese, it doesn't have the fat required to whip up and set the frosting. Soupy cream cheese frosting can be fixed by using only full-fat or regular cream cheese. Remember, the cream cheese is replacing butter in quick buttercream frosting to make cream cheese frosting. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This recipe was yum-o. Loved the cinnamon spice in it. Gave some to the fire house and they loved them too.Will make them again
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This recipe is delicious HOWEVER I have made it more than once and the frosting is always super liquidy, no clue why I've even tried making it with extra powdered sugar 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I've had this recipe for a while but didn't make them until this year. Boy did I regret that! These were the best cupcakes I've ever made. My boyfriend won't let me share them with anybody! I brought them to work and everyone wanted the recipe. I'll be making these every year for the rest of my life, more than likely. : ) 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This is a great recipe. I made it for the guys Poker Night and they loved it!!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#seriously the best cupcakes ive ever made.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#just made for the 1st time for my county fair extension project and walked away with Grand Champion! :) Only thing I did different was the frosting because of cream cheese restrictions- so used a buttercream instead with a touch of cinnamon added- but this recipe is to die for! SOOOO moist! and I'm not a huge pumpkin fan but these are great! Would HIGHLY recommend! They also make about 30 cupcakes so for a big batch - great recipe. Maybe for just my family I might cut in half. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These cupcakes are awesome! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Delicious and so moist! I added about 1/2 cup of applesauce to make them extra moist and they taste great!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This recipe is AWESOME!!! I've made it twice now and both times it has come out moist and delicious...It has awesome texture...light and fluffy! This is my new go to recipe for cupcakes for sure! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Very moist and delicious. However, the amount of icing this recipe makes is way more than you need. I halved the recipe, put it on thick and still had some left over.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#made these cupcakes tonight and my son and i loved them!!!! will definetively make again. thanks for sharing.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#My daughter made these and they were devine! She used nutmeg for ginger since we didn't have any. And instead of buying buttermilk for this one recipe, she used the milk/vinegar substitute. Wonderful!! I hope she makes these again! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Everyone was so impressed when I made these--LOVE THEM!!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This recipie is always a winner at my house. It's also popular for school bake sales and events. I have had friends who do not like pumpkin eat these up and ask for seconds. They might not like pumkin pie, but this pumpkin spice cupcake is a winner! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made these cupcakes for a holiday party and everyone loved them. I made it exactly according to the recipe. This could definitely make about 30 cupcakes if you wanted to stretch it. Instead of the stars like the picture, I used a round tip to make a swirl design that turned out really cute.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#wonderfull taste and texture
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These get rave reviews every time I make them!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I have made this recipe and have reviewed already, I was wondering if anyone has made this as a bread using loaf pans? Its SO good as cupcakes, I would love to make it as bread, any input appreciated, thanks!! :-)
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Incredible recipe. Used fresh pumpkin, came out so moist and rich. Used leftover frosting on everything, including cheesecake and pumpkin pie.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These were good but I did take others advice and cut the sugar down to 2 cups and they were still a little sweet for me but yummy all the same!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These got my finicky husband's stamp of approval as an acceptable substitute for pumpkin roll at Thanksgiving. I piped the frosting on with a star tip as shown and had a lot left over. Will make a half-batch of frosting next time. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#easy to make and a huge hit!

They were a hit with adults as well as kids at our church potluck. It tends to make more than 24 cupcakes which was fine with me! Definately a keeper in my recipe box!! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These cupcakes are amazing. My husband who rarely comments on my cooking asked where I have been hiding this recipe and my 9 yr old daughter asked if I could make them for her class. Followed recipe exactly. Swirled frosting on with pampered chef accent decorator. Have had several people ask for the recipe.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I make this recipe for my Bunko ladies and these cupcakes were a huge hit!!! One lady said it was the best cupcake she had ever eaten. All asked for the recipe. Very easy to make and will make over and over.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Great recipe! Very moist and easy to make. Big hit with my family :) will definitely make again.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made these last week and decorated them to look like pumpkins. Looked cute and tasted amazing!! They were a hit and I'll prolly make them again tonight since I have so much leftover frosting... And I colored the frosting orange to look like a pumpkin so if I don't use it now, I probably never will 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These cupcakes came out very moist and delicious. I only used 3 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar in the frosting recipe and a teaspoon of the cinnamon. Though next time I will use the full 2 teaspoons of cinnamon in the frosting next time.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These are awesome! I iced these as mummies for our school fair. Everyone loved them!!!!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I can't get canned pumpkin. How much cooked pumpkin is equal to this? 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Took these to work this morning, they didn't even make it to 1st break!! All man environment, they thought they were completely outstanding and want me to make more for tomorrow! Good Stuff! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Delicious! Better than I expected!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These pumpkin cupcakes are undeniable the best we have ever had. A little heavy but very moist and the flavor is just perfect. After reading comments about not getting the peak on the frosting, I set my frosting bag in the fridge for about an hour before using and it harden up enough to create beautiful peaks!! I will definately be making these again and again. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made this as a bundt cake -- very moist and delicious. A little too sweet for my taste with the frosting, so will make it again without frosting and perhaps will cut down on sugar.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made a bundt cake instead of cupcakes. It's a very moist cake, very yummy although very sweet. It didn't even need frosting but was yummy nevertheless. I'm going to make it again but will use less sugar. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This was a real hit with my family. We will have this instead of pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Yummy, moist, tasty cupcakes. I made 2 batches...one for us (some to freeze) and one for the potluck at church today. Everyone loved them and complemented on the spicy flavor and tasty cinnamon frosting. I just spread the frosting on top. It firms up after sitting for awhile! So good. I'll make them again and again. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This was delicious! Even though the frosting was a little liquidy it still had a great flavor. The cupcake itself was great! we'll definitely make this again. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I used a different frosting, but the cupcakes are very moist and tasty.

Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These cupcakes were so easy and delicious! Perfect for fall :)
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I would suggest trying a piping bag with a star tip if it seems too soft put in freezer for a few mins to harden it some and that may help  Hope this works for you
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Made these for a get together yesterday, they were fabulous! However, Sledchick, my frosting was spreadable I couldn't get it to peak either. But still very delicious! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made these for a party I was hosting on a chilly fall evening and they were fantastic and a huge hit! They turned out very moist and the flavor was wonderful. I cut the frosting recipe in half and am glad I did because this was plenty. I tried them with and without the frosting and liked them both ways. The frosting is not necessary but really does make them just a little more special. They went well with the spiced hot apple cider I served and I will make these again.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I have made these twice and they are a huge hit! Easy to make and delicious! They will make your kitchen smell yummy!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These are amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A hit at my work for our potluck! But one question......have made these a few times but, never have been able to peak the frosting? Is the picture with canned frosting? Anyone else have this problem.....either way the frosting is still amazing, its just spread on there!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#My kids loved this. My 4 year old wasn't so sure when I put the canned pumpkin in but loved it in the end. Everyone said they were good. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Made this in the fall and took them to work. Everyone raved over them. Very moist and delicious!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These are so moist and tasty and pretty too! I make these whenever I have guests over during the fall season!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#EXCELLENT! I have also found that when pumplin is not available, candied yams work just as great!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#very moist and not overly sweet.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These are GREAT and very delicious! I used only 2 cups of sugar in the frosting and it was not too sweet but just right! I made thse for my husband's potluck for work and got an amazing 48 cupcakes from this recipe! awesome! I will make these again for Thanksgiving instead of my pumpkin roll! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This recipe is delicious- everyone in the office loved them! I made everything per the directions except for the icing. I didn't want an overwhelming cinnamon flavor so I only used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and it came out perfectly. I'm very pleased with the recipe. [And yes, I also had extra batter and icing- I just used a 5 round and made a small cake.] 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I have substituted/exchanged sweet potato and pumpkin in many sweet recipes. A quicker and just as tasty version of this recipe would be to use an equal amount of sweet potato and, instead of a cream cheese frosting, remove cupcakes about 3 minutes early place a large marshmallow on top and return to the oven for the remaining time or until the marshmallows are slightly melted but still fluffy.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made these cupcakes as one of four selections for my daughters wedding and now everyone is asking for the recipe. I got more compliments on this recipe than any of the others flavors. They really are super delicious and I am not really a fan of pumpkin. I did use my own cream cheese frosting recipe though. I will definetly make again and again.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This was really good, even though I cheated and used canned frosting! I had extra batter too!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This is excellent and super easy to make. If you do make a double batch (i.e. 48 cupcakes) don't bother doubling the icing there is way too much left over as it is. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Loved this recipe. I used fresh pumpkin that I cooked, I added chocolate chips, which my husband loved.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This was by far the best cupcake I have ever made!! it turned out absolutely perfect and the cinnamon in the frosting was an excellent touch. I made them for my son's birthday and they were a huge hit!! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Just made these yesterday. My daughter and I ate one right out of the oven and they tasted like a slice of pumpkin pie!! I did add the frosting and cut it in half per peoples suggestion and it was perfect. They made exactly 24 cupcakes. I used my pampered chef cookie scoop (medium one) and it worked really well because the batter is kind of...puffy or frothy. Sooo yummy. My hubby thought the frosting was a little too overpowering. He couldn't tell they were pumpkin cupcakes till i told him. But still loved them. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Very seldom do I cupcakes but these sounded so good, so I made them for a catering job i had. i have never recieved so many compliments on a recipe than i did for these cupcakes. i have a feeling they will be requested often. Great recipe
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This is really great! My family LOVES them. They're great with or without the frosting. Maybe I'll add raisens next time and skip the frosting. The only thing that really needs to change on this recipe is the amount of frosting-way too much-I'll cut the amount in half next time. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#OMGosh!!!! This is a killer cupcake recipe! Absolutely love it!! I won't make any other pumpkin flavored cupcake now. This one is too good and the frosting is d-lish! The cinnamon really adds something special!! YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS RECIPE!!! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Great recipe! My husband always asks for these. I only make half the frosting and it is always more than enough.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This turned out beautifully! The frosting is a wonderful compliment to the full flavored cupcake.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Nice
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These are so yummy! I made them for my 4 year old's halloween party (not such a tough crowd) and they were all gone within the hour! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#My six year old son made these cupcakes for a potluck and they were a hit. Everyone was asking him for the recipe.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This recipe was alright. I didn't add the cinnamon to the frosting and everyone loved the frosting. I will probably make the frosting again. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#My friends and my husband's coworkers loved these! I'm definitely taking them to the in-laws' for Thanksgiving! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#5 stars for the cupcakes but I added more cinnamon. The frosting was, to me, sickening sweet! WAY too much sugar for me.....but that's my taste. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Delish.Everybody loved them.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made this for Girls Night Out and everyone loved them!!!!! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#First time making these cupcakes and they came out great! Everyone at worked loved them. Followed recipe exactly and it does truly make 24 cupcakes. The frosting was wonderful - to die for. In fact I kept a few cupcakes without the frosting and they were equally as good!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Very Moist and rich, a little heavy-as mine did not raise well, they seem to spread out over the top of the muffin tin, I would use non stick spray on the top before I put my cupcake liners in. I also put frosting in ziploc bag, snipped corner and squeezed out the frosting on each cupcake. This cut my frosting time in half.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#A KEEPER! These were so moist! I made exactly as directed with no substitutions and they were perfect. Sprinkled ground pecans on top...DDDD-lish!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Yes, I substituted milk and lemon juice also for the buttermilk. Some collapsed and some didn't. Don't know why. They still were a hit. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#FABULOUS. High in fat though. Took it to a party. Nods of approval everywhere.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made these cupcakes yesterday and used fresh pumpkin that I had just baked and pureed. I used the same amount as a can of pumpkin. They turned out great. Nice and moist. I used buttercream frosting and added cinnamon to the icing. Will definitely make again.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Reviewed Nov. 23 by BirdladyThey were great went over well at our Church Thanksgiving dinner. I sprinkled toasted pecans on top of the frosting which gave them a little crunch and special taste.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These were delicious! I made them for my belgian friend and she loved them! It was here first ever cupcake and it was a huge hit. They are super moist and I used the leftover icing on warmed banana nut bread! WOW!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Excellent! I grated fresh nutmeg on the top of the cupcakes! Beautiful and Delicious!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This was absolutely delish! My whole family loved them, even the kids. I made it a second time as a cake. Takes at least twice the baking time as the cupcakes. Well worth the wait. Just wonderful. It is not complicated, very easy to make.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Haven't made the recipe yet... we have a Christmas bazaar this weekend coming up, and I'll make some regular size ones to sell and mini ones for the luncheon table. Should sell out. I love pumpkin... anything!!! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Absolutely delish! My 5-yr old daughter just loved them too. I plan on using the frosting recipe for my next batch of cinnamon rolls....
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I will make into a cake next time,delicious..
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Too much icing left over. Could I use the already made cream cheese frosting in the tub?
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Great recipe....last reviewer states it only makes 36 not 48 cupcakes....look at the recipe specs again it states the recipe makes 24 cupcakes...I used an ice cream scoop to fill my tins 3/4 full and got 24 extremely large cupcakes.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Won the office pot-luck with this great recipe! I think next time I'll add more cinnamon to the frosting. I also suggest that you keep the frosting @ room temprature until you're SURE you're finished with it as it's SUPER sticky and very hard to work with cold. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These are really good. I took they to work for our Halloween Party and everyone wanted the recipe. Maybe I didn't fill the cups as much as recommended, because it made more than 2 dozen. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Yum......thanks for posting
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I am a secretary for an elementary school and I made a batch of these cupcakes to share with the staff at school.They were a big hit, and I had several requests for the recipe. I will definately make these cupcakes again.
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These cupcakes are delicious! I will make them again for sure! I followed the recipe exactly, and it made 24 large (not jumbo) cupcakes, as well as 16 mini cupcakes.... I also think they would make cute mini loaves!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These were amazing. I didn't have ginger, but substituted nutmeg, they still were fabulous! Can't wait to make more! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These cupcakes are easy to make and have a wonderful flavor. The cream cheese frosting with added cinnamon is a hit and I will be using it for other cakes (like carrot cake). The cupcakes tend to collapse and become flat topped instead of the usual cupcake shape. However, the shape doesn't detract from the flavor. My family loved them! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#WOW!!! Very easy and delicious!!!! They don't last long!!!! Will definitely be making again!!! 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#OK, I substituted the buttermilk with milk and a tablespoon of lemon juice (as directed in the ToH-cookbooks), but the muffins didn't puff up as they should and collapsed somewhat at the end (when still IN the oven). Very strange. Perhaps substituting buttermilk was not such a good idea. The taste however was OK. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Everybody had to take two because they were so delicious!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This is a great recipe but it only made 36 cupcakes, not 48. If I made them again I would cut the frosting recipe in half...WAY too much left over!
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#MY family loved these cupcakes. I didn't even get a chance to frost them. The recipe is easy. The results are great. 
Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These are so easy and came out great. I made them in my Wilton leaf/pumpkin pans and they are just so cute and taste wonderful. I think they are the best cupcakes Ive made yet!!! Knightstown, IN
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#lord hammercy ... this pie was a back breaker for me ... i had to keep thinning out the mixture with more chicken broth than anticipated ... but i finally got there ... thanks for a very tasty pie ... this recipe rocks ... will def make again !!!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#5#2#This is one tasty pot pie recipe, it's definitely a keeper in my household. I believe in trying a recipe as written first and making adjustments later if needed, so that's what I did. Many have said it's very thick as written and I have to agree. It tasted great but was overly thick for my liking. The second time around I used a 1/2 cup of flour and for me, that was the perfect amount. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#2#0#This is my favorite pot pie recipe the only thing I change is the frozen veg I'm weird I prefer canned but tonight I still have fresh corn so I will use that but the best recipe seriously
Favorite Chicken Potpie#5#0#By far, the best chicken pot pie I have ever made. While I followed recipe exactly as written, I did find I had to add a bit more milk. Delicious
Favorite Chicken Potpie#5#5#I dont like corn and peas so I upped the other vegetables and added celery. I also sautéed my chicken with thyme and rosemary, as well as added a tsp of rosemary to the filling. Pies came out amazing! I froze mine first and used them later, following the tips at the bottom.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#11#3#I made it exactly as written and it is so very good. I can't imagine a better recipe, though this is the first homemade Pot Pie I've made. The comments about it being too thick, to me, are very unfounded. I thought at first it was awfully thick, but the end result was perfection in my opinion. I would not have wanted it any thinner, it would have been a mess! This slices well and mmmmmm good! You won't want to lose this recipe! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#8#5#This was the first and only recipe that I've used for chicken pot pie and absolutely love it! It was extremely easy to follow the recipe, and my entire family devours it every time! I subbed the milk out for almond milk and it was delicious. I thinned the mixture a little bit with some extra milk and chicken broth and the mixture turned out to have a really nice consistency. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#27#23#I've made this many times. This last time I made it i bagged the extra filling and stuck it in the fridge.....its been 3 days now I'm wondering if uts still good to stick in a pie crust & bake...... @aurthor if your seeing this I really gotta know. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#5#1#Best chicken pot pie recipe. Make your own crusts or buy them, but you will get FOUR pies if you follow the recipe, which is even better. Freeze em! Buy the deep dish ones too.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#30#27#This is at least the 4th time I have made this. I use half the butter, and just a little over half the flour. I add a pound of mushrooms, cooked down so as not to add liquid. I use shallots instead of onion. I then throw in a bunch of garlic, parsley, basil, a little marjoram. No thyme. Since it is just the two of us, I bake both, and after they have chilled I cut them into dinner slices, wrap them individually, and freeze them. Stunningly delicious pot pie!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#8#1#This chicken pot pie recipe is really good! I got 2 pies out of it and had plenty of leftovers! My family loved it. Will definitely make this again ??
Favorite Chicken Potpie#14#3#Every year I make this with Thanksgiving leftovers and every year I am so glad I did. I usually get 3-4 pies out of this recipe depending on the size I make and they freeze beautifully. I love always having one on hand for a night I don't feel like cooking and can just pop one in the oven for a few hours and walk away.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#10#1#This had great flavor but the mixture was too thick. It was like pasty gravy. May be just a personal preference that I like it more creamy. Therefore, I will definitely use less butter and flour next time.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#5#9#Made this for dinner tonight, and the gravy was super thick. I wish I had stuck to my instincts and put about half the flour in it, or maybe used cornstarch instead. Also, with adding the milk, it's more like a cream gravy, and I prefer a rich traditional chicken gravy. Not terrible, but won't be a keeper for our house. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#17#2#This recipe is wonderful! I've made it as written several times with homemade crust. It makes enough filling as written for 2 deep dish 9 inch pies, or 3ish normal pie pans. If you do 2 normal pie pans, they will be overflowing and quite saucy. My additions after tasting as written are to add a teaspoon of garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of rosemary and sage. Easy shortcut if you're in a hurry is to replace the carrot/peas/carrots with mixed frozen veggies! This is my son's FAVORITE meal - so I just quadrupled the recipe with great success (you'll need multiple pots if you do). 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#2#1#I have made this pot pie for several years!! My father in law LOVES it!! Thank you for a delicious addition to family traditions!!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#7#1#Made this per recipe but omitted the onions and used my homemade pie crust. It was very good and have lots of sauce which some potpies do not have.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#14#3#This was a really great recipe! So many recipes online these days are fails, but this worked perfectly! For our family's preference, I used 1/2 cup butter instead of 1 cup. The recipe still worked just fine with half the butter. We also prefer a bit more seasoning, so I added a teaspoon of my poultry seasoning and some ground cayenne pepper, and snuck in a handful of julienned kale for a little extra nutrition. I'm sure the seasoning in the recipe would be just fine as is though for most families.  The amount of filling this makes is plentiful - easily enough for two deep dish pie plates, but one could probably even do 3 shallow pie dishes. I baked one pie and put the other in the freezer for another night. My family loved this recipe. Thank you for a reliable recipe that we will use again and again. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#5#0#Excellent recipe, easy to follow, delicious!! I like to sometimes add some bacon too My son loves it!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#9#1#This is easily the most delicious chicken pot pie i have made. There IS a ton of filling.... roughly 4 1/2 cups per pie for a total of 9 cups of filling. I only had 1 large pie pan, so i divided the filling in half with a 4 1/2 cup measure. I will make the other when the dish is clean and freeze it then. My house smells heavenly.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#2#1#Easy delicious recipe! Loved the pie and making it
Favorite Chicken Potpie#15#1#I have been making this chicken pot pie recipe for years now. I usually give the second one away. I've gotten so many Compliments From this recipe. It is everyone's favorite. So scrumptious and delicious! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#4#0#GREAT recipe.........Love the whole recipe....ONE CORRECTION...IT MADE 4 9 inch pies so either half the recipe or make sure you have a lot of freezer space or friends to give them too..LOL...
Favorite Chicken Potpie#3#0#I have been making this for the past three years and we love it. The only thing I did not add was the thyme since my husband and I aren't a fan of it. Love the fact that I bake one and freeze one each time I make this recipe.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#This is such an amazing recipe! Thank you so much.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#10#31#A cup of butter and a cup of flour to make the roux for the gravy? Preposterous! I fell for it and ended up throwing out most of the flour/butter mess. It's impossible that other people followed the recipe and gave it any stars at all. I was able to salvage what I had and it ened up quite good, however. Just beware of that cup of butter and cup of flour. Is that a typo or what? 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#3#0#The best recipe I've found! I used a deep dish pie pan and it came out beautifully. Will definitely make many times. Shared a photo of it with my daughter who asked me to make her one this weekend!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#6#0#Definitely a winter go to favorite for my house! I added a splash of white wine to the final mixture. So yummy! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#6#2#Delicious! Made this tonight and did not make any changes. Will be making again, loved it!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#5#1#I used unsweetened almond milk to make it dairy free and Bob's red mill G.F flour and it turned out great!I also threw in a couple cups of chopped fresh baby spinach. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#9#2#Made this for the first time tonight and it was bomb. I made some alterations because my family doesn't like English peas. Instead, I stirred in leftover fresh spinach for color and it was all kinds of wonderful. Make sure you use both dark meat and white meat! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#8#0#First time making chicken pot pie, this recipe yielded (3)z I used a rotisserie chicken and biscuits on top. It was fantastic. Froze one.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#9#1#Been making this for a couple of years. This is the best I've eaten. I double the recipe to share with my son's family. I am so glad I found this recipe.You will want to save this, I promise!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#12#5#Made this today and was very pleased. I left out the onions and corn. I diced the carrots and potatoes, used one can of Libby green peas. I used three chicken breasts and two thighs and boiled them , so I had some real chicken broth. For the milk, I used evaporated milk, (one cup milk, 1/2 cup water). I didn't use a bottom crust. For the top crust, I used a store-bought pie crust, and rolled it out thinner to fit a 9x12 oblong pan. Husband bragged on it without any prodding! I only used half the filling, so I plan to make another to share with someone tomorrow. I really like the fact that it makes two pot pies. Will be making this again! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#6#0#haven't made this yet - concerned about the bottom crust being soggy without blind baking it first - haven't read that anyone did this... was your bottom crust soggy? 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#8#3#Best chicken pot pie I've ever eaten, OMG! I roasted two large chicken breasts beforehand, and steamed whole red potatoes then peeled and diced afterward. I also used a package of frozen peas and carrots. Makes a super-creamy pot pie, enough for 2 pies. Be sure to vent your pies on top, they need to let out steam. Mine cracked on top, but who cares, it was fantastic!! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#Absolutely delicious! Easy, tasty and filling!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#2#3#I've never made a chicken pot pie before and I am SO glad I chose this recipe! Yum! I roasted a whole chicken in the morning and diced it up which I will definitely do again for this, such good flavor! I froze one of the pot pies, can't wait to see how it turns out.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#2#0#This was amazing!!! Delicious! Great for a cold winters day. Highly recommend. I used little purple potatoes which gave it a little more color.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#4#0#We've made this recipe at least 4 times and my family loves it! It's hearty and has incredible flavor. We've used all dark meat chicken or a mix of white and dark and both are great. It's foolproof!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#3#0#This is so good, even my husband loved it & he usually does not like chicken dishes. Love that you can cook 2 pies & freeze one for later, & the reheated frozen pie tastes just as delicious as the freshly made pie.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#5#0#I made this potpie today and loved it. I put have of the filling in a freezer bag for the next time I have a taste for chicken potpie. This is a keeper.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#2#0#I halved this recipe to make one perfect pie. I used chicken stock to cook my chicken breasts then reused to cook carrots and potatoes. Used 2% milk and light butter. Very delicious!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#3#0#Excellent! I don't usually use recipes when I cook but this is a keeper. Will definitely make again. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#2#0#This is how mom used to make pot pie. Always great.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#3#1#Excellent recipe. I altered the veggies that I used but followed the rest of the recipe. The creamy roux in this thing is on point. So delicious. I make one pie using the creamy mixture and then freeze the creamy mixture for a future pie. It's perfect. Love it!!! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#2#0#My neighbor brought this over after I got out of the hospital Tues. night. I bugged her for the recipe right away. I don't know what about this recipe that makes it so great, but it is the best pot pie I ever tasted. It must be the thyme, butter and chicken broth. Really fantastic and will be baking it for myself after my hip heals. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#2#0#Great recipe. I followed all the directions, but I smoked a whole chicken on my Yoder stick burner smoker. That added a wonderful smoky savory flavor, especially after putting an herby rib on it. I'll definitely do it again!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#2#0#This was the best pot pie I've ever made! I halved the recipe, used frozen mixed vegetables. My only change will be to cube the chicken Into bigger pieces next time.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#2#0#Great recipe and an easy one. Whenever I have left over roasted chicken I make this dish. I dice the carrots instead of slice, and don't add the corn. Other than that follow recipe exactly. Perfect consistency to the sauce. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#Love this recipe. I left out the corn and only used a top crust. Wonderful recipe for a quick dinner since I quite often boil chicken, dice and freeze it and the broth.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#2#0#This was the best pot pie that I have ever eaten. I halved the recipe so that I made one pie just for my husband and me. It is one that I will make again and will share with others how good it was. I moved it to a lower rack the last 5 minutes to make sure the bottom crust was well done. Again one of the best ever! ( chopped half a large onion. I peeled/diced and boiled 2 potatoes, used 2/3 cup frozen corn and 1/2 cup peas and 3/4 cup canned carrots, drained the ones that needed to have liquid removed , boiled 2 ck breast and shredded them ) the sauce was half of the regular as given and had great flavor and thickened well. Had a little extra filling left over so I made a very small one with just crust on top. Yummy. ***I see that another reviewer said they made the full recipe and froze half of the filling for another time, good idea also.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Good recipe.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#2#0#I made this for Thanksgiving dinner for two. We had already had turkey with the family the week before so we were looking for an alternative meal. We loved it! I only needed one pot pie for the two of us and don't have freezer room for a whole pie, so I put the extra filling in a freezer bag for future use. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#2#0#My Mother In Law made this for my husband and I to save for when I had my son. A quick meal to heat up. Since then I have made this 4x. This is a great recipe. The only thing I changed (based on personal preference) I added 3 cloves of garlic and fresh thyme and rosemary from my Garden. I also only used 1 stick of butter. Great recipe. Will continue to make
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#I add canned diced potatoes to mine so good... everyone that has tried it is obsessed.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#Awesome! Followed the directions to the letter and was very satisfied with the end product. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#This recipe was exactly what I was looking for,rich thick gravy and delicious. I don't care for pie crust so I used one puff pastry and cut the recipe in half. Now I wish I had made the whole thing as it was so good. I omitted the corn but added celery everything else I include. I used canned chicken and used the broth from the cans for the gravy. I used a smaller rectangle dish than a 9 x13. it was 8 x 11.5. So good! I froze the leftovers and even took a serving over to my neighbor who lives alone. She liked it too. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Made it yesterday, very tasty. Excellent recipe
Favorite Chicken Potpie#2#0#This was the best chicken pot pie I've ever made, and is so much better than the store bought ones. It's classic and perfectly creamy..My boyfriend rates every recipe I try and this one he gave 11/10, and I agree! I made some minor edjustments - I used the 3 cups of chicken stock to boil the carrots and potatoes, and reserved the liquid to add back in later. I only added 3/4 cup of flour instead of 1 cup. And I added 2 stalks of chopped celery when I added the onion to the pan. I made 1 pie last night,and froze the filling for a future pie. I can truly say I will never buy a store bought chicken pie again. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was so good, its quite time consuming, but well worth it. This recipe makes way to much for just my husband and I ...so I just made one nine inch pie with my own pie crust, and will freeze the rest of the filling in food saver bags. I am going to put filling over noodles next time, hope it stands up to the freezer for a couple weeks.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Added red and green bell pepper, and broccoli florets and extra chicken broth to the gravy. Cut the recipe in half and still got two 9 inch pies! Very good and I'm freezing one of the pies for use as another easy dinner
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#I actually made this for my son & daughter-in-law, who just had a new baby, so was making some easy meals for them. I made an extra for us. It was so quick & easy to make. I thought that it was delicious & probably the best chicken pot pie that I've ever had. My husband said, I don't know what you did, but... it was better than any other I've ever eaten . I will definitely make this again & freeze a few as well. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#Wonderful recipe! We found out that we do not like Thyme, so my daughter uses Rosemary instead. Such a delicious perfect recipe! She also makes her own pie crust which makes it even better! She makes 1/2 the portions because otherwise it's too much for just 1 pie unless is a bigger deeper pie dish. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#1#This is a family favorite! I've made it multiple times and it's a hit every time. It's easy to make which is my favorite kind of recipe because I really don't like to cook lol. With ease in mind, I typically use frozen mixed veggies and frozen onions. If I don't have potatoes at hand I increase the chicken and veggies to make up the volume. I will cook one and freeze the other for another day. Great recipe!!! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Absolutely the BEST chicken pot pie recipe. I made a few minor adjustments based on ingredients I had at home. Throwing out my old recipe. This is the cat's meow!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#1#LOVED THIS PIE. I made half a recipe (more or less) in a 10 pie plate with my favorite crust recipe. I didn't have thyme so I used poultry seasoning, The corn was canned because that's what I had, and the carrots were leftover roasted. No peas since hubs really can't stand them, so I threw in some leftover green beans instead. And I used a combination of skim milk and half&half, because again, it's what I had. Pandemic baking, as another reviewer noted. But it was creamy and delicious, and next time I will make extra and freeze. Yum!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Great recipe. I made some adjustments for our family. I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of garlic powder. I also increased the seasonings to reflect the following: dried thyme to 2 teaspoons, 1 1/2 teaspoons of pepper and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt. I also swapped the milk for half and half. It was perfect that way for our families tastebuds!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#Was craving comfort food, and this was everything I hoped for... easy to follow instructions. Was a big hit with my husband.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#Delicious! I made a few adjustments. I substituted whole milk with oat milk. I used pearl onions instead of chopped onion. I added onion powder and garlic powder to the seasonings. I added broccoli when boiling potatoes and carrots. I added mushrooms when adding peas and corn. I seasoned my chicken when cooking it with same seasoning as I put in this pie. I half baked the bottom pastry before adding filling and top layer of pastry to ensure it wasn't under cooked. I use a square glass baking dish rubbed with a generous coating of butter. I would love to try it with Turkey breast! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Delicious, I will definitely make it again
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#This was sooo good. Will make it again.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I have been making this recipe for years; it has become a family favorite! I usually make little individual pies to freeze with the extra filling. It is my go to, to bring to friends after surgery or tragic loss.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Delicious! I added seasoned salt, poppyseeds, a bay leaf and diced celery
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I made some adjustments. Firstly, I cut the recipe in half. I cooked the potatoes and carrots in three cups water three cubes of chicken bouillon, stained the broth to use it in the roux. I used three cups of chicken broth 3/4 cups 2% milk, and between 1/2-2/3 cups heavy cream. The sauce was perfect with the extra liquid. My husband and I absolutely loved it.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#Delicious!! Even the picky eaters gobbled it down :)
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I love this recipe. I make a vegetarian dairy free version of this pot pie 4-5 times a year. I sub the dairy for almond milk and vegan butter then use more veggies and vegetable broth instead of chicken. Always a crowd favourite, even meat eaters and kids!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Delicious! Nice blend of chicken and vegetables. A keeper, for sure!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#1#Corrected review: A half cup of flour per pie was too much. It came out too gluey and dense. I started over, used a little less than a 1/4 cup per pie, and it turned out good. Thick enough to hold everything together but still creamy.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was delicious I added garlic because I love garlic but it was so wonderful!! The base sauce was so creamy I used low fat milk but was still deliciousness I also added better then chicken bouillon in with the chicken stock step for more flavor ????
Favorite Chicken Potpie#2#2#I make a lot of recipes off the internet and I usually don't post reviews, but I'm sitting here eating some chicken pot pie and I'm wondering why in the cussword I've never made this before! This is absolutely delicious and I think if I didn't have more self control I'd eat the whole thing right now. Make this pie. If you don't like thyme, then reduce. It's got a lot of thyme. But it's fantastic. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#This is a perfect recipe. I was glad it made 2 pies; I was making one for a friend and another to keep. We had ours last night and it was exactly what I hoped it would be! Ultimate comfort food! Our very picky 5 year old loved it. He asked for seconds. I swapped the dried thyme out for 1 tablespoon of fresh thyme because I love using fresh herbs. I boiled my potatoes/carrots in chicken broth, then used the same broth to boil the cubes chicken meat breast and used the same broth for the gravy. I imagine using a rotisserie chicken would make this even easier. I also did a light egg wash on the crust for color. I will be saving this recipe as my new go-to for pot pie!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I love this recipe! I first came upon it 13 years ago when I was making freezer meals in preparation for our second daughter on the way and wanted to have meals ready in the freezer. I've made it over and over ever since! It is the ultimate comfort food and I love that it makes 2 pies. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Best chicken pot pie recipe I have found! My family loves it!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#1#This recipe is a keeper! I highly recommend this!!! Best I have made and will keep this recipe when making in the future. I read other reviews and agree the base sauce is excellent! So easy to make with simple ingredients. I made the chicken in a slow cooker and cooked with vegetable stock for flavor. When done, I shredded  taste was great. I did the potatoes, but left out the corn and peas as I don't have. I added celery when cooking the onions for a bit of texture. Instead of pie crust, I made buttermilk biscuits and put on the top. Using a small roasting pan allowed to have biscuits for all and it covers the pan nicely. Try this, you will like it and so will the family!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Having never made a chicken pot pie before in my life, I was thrilled with how easy this recipe was to make and how delicious it turned out. We halved the recipe to make just one pie. The nice thing: this was a forgiving recipe. We had slightly less chicken then called for but slightly more potatoes. And didn't have any onions (because that's pandemic cooking!) so just used some onion powder for flavor. Really: as long as you fill the pie and have the right amount of the gravy mix, it's okay to have some variation on the fillings and will still turn out great. Will absolutely make this again and again! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#3#0#I have made chicken, and other pot pies, for 30 years. This is, by far, my favorite BASE recipe! I can never make a recipe without some augmentation to make it my own... mishpachah...like family, my Bubbe would say. I omitted the milk. I used a cup of homemade milk free gravy I had left from the meal for which I made the roast chicken we were using (leftovers) for this pie. I recently discovered, if done right, no milk is needed and creaminess survives! I also added an extra cup of chicken broth to compensate for the fluid. In addition I added a Tbs of dried parsley and substituted diced yams for the white potatoes. I made a homemade simple crust (ice water, butter, flour and salt) and brushed the top with yolk/water combo and sprinkled with a few pinches of dries thyme. The cooking time was spot on, even here at high elevation in Colorado. I only wish you could see the photos and taste the creamy, hearty, comforting goodness. I froze the second Pot Pie filling on it's own to be put in a fresh crust another time. During this pandemic freezer space is at a premium. My new go to Pot Pie recipe. Mazel Tov to Taste of Home!!! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Best pot pie recipe I have ever found. Made this last night for Sunday family dinner and everyone raved about it. One pie fed 7 adults and 2 small children! Only changes I made to recipe were omitting the thyme (picky kids) and adding 1/2 cup half and half in with milk. Delicious. Will make this again and again.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#My go to pot pie recipe. this is absolutely delicious!!! I always make this for company and get rave reviews!!!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Absolutely delicious comfort food and well worth the time. I added celery to the onion carrot saute and 2 bay leaves to the cream sauce while it simmered but then removed them. I used half for a 2 crust pot pie and froze it. (It cooked up great 3 weeks later.) The other half of the chicken mix I baked in a 2 qt Pirex baker uncovered st 350° for 35 min while I made homemade waffle batter (reduced the sugar and typical spices, adding a pinch of poultry spice instead.) My family went wild over the waffles topped with the bubbling and rich hot chicken veggie gravy. A total hit and kept the pot pie 3 weeks later seeming like a whole new dish. Winner winner 2 chicken dinners!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I have been working on adjusting a similar recipe for years and for my tribe here are the only changes I make. On the 1.5 cups of milk make half of this liquid whole milk and the other half and half or if you have heavy whipping creme us it. This makes a huge difference and might create the need to cut back on flour as this gets really thick fast. Next is while the sauce is simmering throw in two slices of american or Velveeta cheese. Last but not least is two to three cloves of garlic, pressed. Put this in during sauce thickening. I sent this home with my daughter and her husband ate almost a full half pie at a sitting. He is skinny as a rail and eats like a bird but he said this was one of the best dishes he has ever had. HE would not say that for fun. It's goooouooood! Also, I substitute shrimp for the chicken some times and make Shrimp Pot Pie. Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm! Gary 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Deliscous will make again and again.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Easy and it was the best
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is a go to recipe for me. I always multiply the recipe because it's so easy to freeze. Just the thing when you want to bring a comfort food dinner to folks. The frozen version tastes just as good and it times I've substituted ingredients with good results.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#My entire family loved this- even my picky 4 year old. I did not have corn, which was a bummer, but pie still full of veggies. I used a large pyrex and used pizza dough, rather than pie dough on top only. Delish! Also- I always leave out thyme, as I think it is too strong!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I would use the potato and carrot water and less flour and milk. The starch from the water will help to thicken the sauce and add flavor.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This recipe is SUPERIOR to any others I have tried! It has now become a regular home comfort-food for our large family--so delish! We prefer just one crust on the top so I just put the filling into a casserole dish/dishes and top with crust then bake!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#This far exceeded my expectations (which were already high because this site has never let me down). It makes so much that I actually made three pies with it. I added basil and mushrooms. Frozen pies are excellent for new parents. I brought one to a couple recently, and it was a huge hit. Definitely file this one away as a keeper.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Had no issue with flour as others have had. It was the perfect consistency. Very tasty! Teenage daughter said it was the bomb ......The prep work took a lot longer than 40 min as recipe stated. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#This was very good...I cut back some on flour.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I only used 1/3 cup of flour the second time I made this. It was delicious both times, but we like the filling a bit thinner. It's definitely a new favorite in our house.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Made this last night, was the best! Didn't have thyme so used basil and it was perfect :) 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#What kind of potatoes
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Really satisfied my craving for chicken pot pie and is easy to make.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#The best!!! I make my own crust and that is the only change I make.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#My husband said this potpie was the best I've ever made. I added celery with the onions, and boiled carrots and potatoes in chicken broth then used the broth to make the sauce. Topped with tater tots, instead of crust. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Halved recipe; added 1/4 tsp. of Bell's Poultry Seasoning and used Tater Tots instead of pie crust. It's in the oven now and it smells really good - we can't wait to eat it .
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Best potpie I've ever had. Hands down. Subs I've made in the past include using rabbit in place of chicken and subbing cauliflower in for the potatoes. I'll be making this one for a long time. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#To be brutally honest, this is very close to the Chicken Pot Pie recipe found in the older versions of Betty Crocker cookbooks, which is the best recipe I've ever tasted. While homemade crust is better in my opinion, it's also far more time consuming. This is a quick and easy recipe and the filling is right on the money. If, somehow, you come out with a bland meal after using a full cup of butter, you're doing something wrong. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Where do the potatoes in the directions come from?
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I love this recipe! I use this recipe at home and at my job.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is the only chicken pot pie recipe I make. The flavors are well-developed and it is pretty easy to make. I generally use a rotisserie chicken for the 4 cups of chicken. I get requests for this pot pie quite often. It's definitely a favorite in my family. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#We simply love this recipe. I cook it as written and find it is just right! I make 2 pies so we can share with my sister's family. I have never found it pasty or gummy and have made it numerous times. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I love this recipe. I cook it exactly as it reads and it turns out perfect everytime. There is no other pot pie that can compare to this one, and the thyme is crutial for delivering taste. A forever keeper for the whole family to enjoy!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#My family loves this pot pie recipe. Make it often. Sometimes with frozen crust and sometimes with fresh made pie crust. Always a hit. A definite keeper and thanks for sharing.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Absolutely best chicken pot pie. Husband not a thyme lover so substituted sage and summer savory. Liked thickness of sauce. I only made 1 pie and saved half of filling for another day. Will definitely make again. Maybe even try in individual pies. Thank you
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Great!! I add more chicken, a Tbsp of chicken soup base paste and then omit the regular salt.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#Everyone loves this!! All 4 of my boys and husband devour these pies! We've often had guests over and they have always raved about it! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#sounds easy
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I am surprised that no one took exception to the cup of butt
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#1#Horrible recipe ! The sauce was a stark white, tasteless paste that no amount of doctoring after the fact could resolve. A total waste of ingredients and home made pie crust. A much better option is to make your chicken stock ( or use store-bought stock ) and thicken it using 1 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup cold water and simmer until it thickens before adding the chicken and vegetables. That way you still have chicken gravy not flour gravy. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#My husband and I agree that it's the best chicken pie recipe we've tried, but I agree with Sfcollins about reducing the flour a bit. Thank you for sharing this recipe! ~BW
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Not sure how this received so many positive comments. I made recipe as written and it resulted in a very thick and gummy sauce. It is far too much flour in this recipe. If I make it again, I'll cut flour in half. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I thought this was very good. The only issue I have is the amount of thyme listed in the recipe. I didn't even use 1 full tsp and it was still very overpowering. Next time I'll use 1/4 tsp if any at all. I also made it in a 10x13 baking dish (instead of two round pies) which worked very well. Would definitely recommend - just use less thyme. ??
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I freeze the filling, and pull out two ready made pie crusts right before baking (one deep dish and one regular). YUM!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I freeze the filling, and pull out two ready made pie crusts right before baking (one deep dish and one regular). YUM!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I'm totally confused by everyone who loved this recipe. I halved it because I was making one pie. I found the 1/2 cup of flour way too much for thickening. I had to thin it using additional milk and broth which threw me off. I then needed additional salt and pepper. When I realized how thick my sauce was I looked at other recipes. For the amount of liquid I used, 1/3 cup of flour is appropriate. I'm certain I measured correctly. My flour was all purpose. It was fine after the adjustment. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Absolutely amazing! I made crust from scratch because I didn't have store bought on hand and I'm excited to see how much easier it is with a rotisserie chicken and packaged pie crust! My son is allergic to dairy so I used Earth Balance buttery spread sticks instead of butter and unsweetened original Plant Milk instead of whole milk and the whole family chowed down like it was their last meal on earth. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#It's perfect. There's no a thing I'd change. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Such a wonderfully comforting and delicious filling! I used my own butter-based pie crust recipe, and made the filling as per the directions. Great comfort food! My husband said it was the best chicken pot pie he's ever had.??
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#this was really good. The only thing I did different was instead of adding the carrots, I used frozen peas and carrots. Next time I might try adding mushrooms (though it's good without them too). I'll make it again for sure 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Excellent as written! I love that this contains no canned soups(though I do use them for convenience sometimes). I used rotisserie chicken for this. Love the tip about the slumped crust! I learned something new. Lynne, Volunteer Field Editor
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was amazing! My guys loved it and told me not to change anything.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#The note at the bottom says to let the fluted crust rest in the fridge. I take it to mean that you are putting the whole pie in the fridge?
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Making this for the second time tonight, i use king Arthur flours chicken pot pie crust recipe along with this recipe and the results are simply fantastic, substituted onion salt, heavy cream and celery and mushrooms no potatoes, also used 4 bouillon cubes, just awesome.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Best ever pot pie!! We added garlic to the onions and rosemary and parley to the spices. Moisture and texture were a concern, but it was perfect. We all loved it!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Awesome flavor and relatively easy to make. I added 2 stalks of celery and omitted the boiling of the carrots and potatoes as I had diced them fairly small. When I make again I will boil the carrots and celery as they were still a little crunchy, but red potatoes were perfect as is. As a personal preference the gravy made with the flour was a bit too thick and I think I would cut the flour in half next time to make it a little easier to fill in the gaps for the pie.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This recipe is probably one of the best pot pie recipes I've eaten! Very filling!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Thank you, Regi M, for your review. So glad you took the time to give such helpful information AND share the knowledge that you have acquired from your experience.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#2#0#I am a young senior and a well seasoned cook and baker - pun intended! I know there will be some who will start clucking under their breaths when I say I haven't made this exact recipe, but is is very close to one my mother, who was a fabulous cook, taught me years ago. I read a lot of the reviews, because there are so many, and I want to make comments based on what I read and my level of experience. Because there are so many who commented on there being too much thyme in this recipe I would suggest that if you do not use thyme regularly that you add the amount suggested in increments. If you're not use to more heavily spiced foods start off with a quarter of a teaspoon - then sample it. Not enough, add another quarter of a teaspoon and sample it again. If you like that amount you don't need to add the full teaspoon. Flavours become more pronounced as they cook and have time to combine with other ingredients. Spicing is a very personal thing and so you should always try a bit if you are concerned there is too much of anything. You will not get zapped by lightening if you adjust the seasonings to your own personal preferences. AND - it does not mean the recipe is not great. The person who submitted the recipe likes the seasoning - based on her family's taste buds but it doesn't mean it can't be adjusted to your own! The same goes for any other recipe. Have some teaspoons ready to sample recipes as you go. Personalize to your heart's content! It really irritates me when people comment about throwing food out because they don't know how to make it more palatable. I do have to remind myself though that not everyone had a mother like mine or had Home Economics classes in high school - though they didn't teach me much I hadn't learned at home. Cooking and baking can be so much fun and life is too short to get so caught up on minor issues. Remember - add a pinch or so, sample and add more till it is to your taste. Baking has to be a more precise exercise because there has to be an exact ratio of rising agent (as an example) to other dry ingredients and liquids used. Again, flavouring is a very personal matter. I would like to thank Karen Johnson for submitting this recipe that makes this potpie from scratch, with no condensed soup and artificial flavours! To quote from a book called Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, I read in my early 20's Knowledge is communicable, wisdom is not. One of my Mom's favourites: We get too soon old and too late smart! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Best pot pie recipe I've ever found! We don't care for thyme so left that out and still wonderful! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is the quintessential pot pie. The flavors are spot on. This was exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#YUMMY!You do not need to look for another pot pie recipe.This is it!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I was really excited about this, but after spending much time on it, I was disappointed as it seemed bland except for the fact that there was way too much of a thyme taste. Next time, I'll cut the thyme and add other seasonings. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#So my fiance and I are both pretty indifferent to chicken pot pie, but I found myself browsing recipes in order to use some extra chicken I had before it went bad. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. Upon eating one bite, he says, this has to go into the rotation! . We both then devoured the tastiest chicken pot pie ever created. I did do a few things differently. I seared 5 chicken breast strips in vegetable oil that I coated in garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. I was out of thyme and thought the italian seasoning might add the missing flavor to the dish. I used one whole can of drained carrotts, and half the amount of the rest of the items the recipe called for. After adding the cubed chicken I cooked prior, the recipe was still enough for 2 pies. I did not have 4 pie crusts so I used my largest round corningware casserole dish in place of a pie pan, which provided room for the entire mixture. It worked perfectly! This is definitely in the rotation from now on! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is the BEST Chicken Potpie I have ever tasted. This is a keeper!!! Thank you for the recipe.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#How do you print out this recipe. Don't see an option. Thanks
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I followed the recipe but left out the potatoes (dint want to over starch or whatever) and no chicken as i dont eat it. Added steak seasoning and onion salt. i used frozen veggies. I used pork shoulder that i made a few days earlier. IT WAS DELICIOUS! Now if i had known pot pies were this easy. I feel so silly buying them. My store bought pie crust wasn't any good so i had to improvise with pizza dough. YUMMM. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is such a versatile and great recipe. I double recipe and freeze extra in pans without crust. Put Crust In A Pan Add Filling And Bake!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I have been making this recipe for several years and it's a favorite for everyone I've fed it to. My kids in particular love it. To save prep time I use 16 oz frozen diced potatoes and 16 oz frozen mixed veggies. I also decreases the thyme to 1/2 tsp. I do end up making 3 pies using these amounts. Lately my kids have decided they don't like the crust as much so I only put crust on the top. It's definitely time consuming to make, but having 2 spare in the freezer makes it worth it. Plus I love it so much!! The reheat from frozen instructions are spot on. If you haven't tried this, you are missing out! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I've used this recipe several times. I love it! I use it for turkey pot pies too and adjust the herbs. It is an excellent way to use up roast turkey and freeze pies for later. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#okay -- did not have everything and needed something quicker but used as a starting point! Made half the recipe and wanted to reduce time by dicing up 1 cup of small new potatoes from a can for starters.. added about a cup of fresh mushrooms diced up along with onions to saute in butter. Substituted 12 oz package of mixed veggies for all other veggies -- will use more next time. Used over-flowing 2 cups of rotisserie chicken along with jell from drippings in container. Mixed everything together along with 1/2 cup of sour cream and placed in 11x7 casserole dish and topped with Parmesan cheese and then small cut-outs from pie crust. Oh, used Thyme leaves and it was all wonderful! I will definitely be making this again -- and probably in the very near future! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Made this for dinner tonight....loved it!!! Will definitely be making this again! Thanks for the recipe.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#For those that had an overwhelming thyme taste use dried thyme LEAVES .....NOT ground thyme. Fresh thyme works best in my opinion..... especially if you can find lemon thyme. (It is easy to grow too. Best in 12x12 x12 inches deep pots and potting soil. Use started small plants rather than seeds. So easy and cheaper in the long runI like to add the juice of one lemon in this as well. The only way to make this even better is to have some homemade stock on hand. I save and freeze all chicken bones in a bag in freezer. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I really liked this pot pie!! It was delicious. And it made 2 pies so I got to freeze one and have it the next week. Perfect if you are making dinner for another family who needs the help.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This pot pie is amazing! I tried the recipe without the thyme and added some onion salt and seasoning salt and it was absolutely delicious!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#The thyme overpowered the taste of this pie, otherwise it should have been fine. A lot of steps to have the one seasoning throw it off.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is so delicious! There are a lot of steps but it is worth it!!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Made this tonight, it was awesome. My husband loved it. Been making a pot pie for years that has cheese in it but this one takes the prize. Cut recipe in half and only made one tonight, anxious to make again and try freezing one.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Made this tonight, I love it . I did follow the recipe but have a deep dish pie plate and made just one. Hanging onto this one for sure.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#1#0#This is a good, solid recipe. I've been wanting to make a pot pie for years; my grandma used to make them, but i dont have her recipe, so just beginning to experiment. It was 10 degrees and snowing, so today was the day.I had to make it dairy-free, so substituted the butter with bacon fat, and just used a bit more broth, and the liquid from the corn (i used canned, not frozen), to replace the milk; total abot 4.5 cups liquid. Next time I think i will try oat milk in place of the dairy milk; all we had in the fridge was almond milk, and I didn't think that would work well.I also cooked down some portobello'shrooms (about two cups before cooking) in the pan first, and added a cup or so of chopped celery along with the onions. I pretty much followed all the other measurements. Oh, added a bit of ground clove, too.It was really great. My two boys & wife loved it; it was gone in minutes. I made just one pie (only had one box of crusts) in an extra deep 10 stoneware pie pan, and still have enough filling left over for probably another small pie. But tomorrow is another snow day, and I suspect the kids will warm it up and have it for breakfast. That's how they roll. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Made this on a cold, winter's night and it was a big hit! The pan was wiped clean. So needless to say, it's going in my recipe box! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Made this tonight, absolutely delicious! I usually make a recipe I got from the pioneer woman, it's similar and good, but this is really really good. I did mine as instructed but instead of making 2 Round pie plate pot pies, I made one in my 9x13 stoneware dish. And I only added 1 pie crust. I have an 18 year old and my husband, and they're big eaters! So this way to serve, for us worked great!I highly recommend this recipe! You won't be disappointed! It's a keeper! Enjoy!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Any substitute for milk?
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Great recipe. I didn't change anything except for I did make only one pie by using half of each ingredient. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Wish you would put how much of each ingredient to make only one pie. Would help on all recipies I think. Thank you.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is a fantastic recipe! I make it just as written except I sub fat-free half and half for milk. Because of my family's taste preferences, I sometimes omit potatoes and use frozen carrot/pea mix instead of fresh carrots. I often add frozen green beans as well. I use unsalted chicken stock to reduce sodium. These taste perfectly fresh after several months in the freezer. I wrap them in plastic wrap, then put in a gallon ziplock to freeze. Def. one of my top new recipes I've added this year. The only problem is that it's so good, we eat too much :)! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Made this and it's totally awesome. Tried freezing it and the sauce turned to water so it doesn't freeze well. But this is my new favorite. The second time I made it I put in half the amount of potatoes and more chicken. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I have made this several times and it's a favorite hands down! I put all the filling in one large pan instead of 2 pie plates. Made my own crust for a 2 crust pie and put it on top, no bottom crust. We don't like thyme much so subbed out the thyme and subbed in poultry seasoning. Delicious! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Loved it so much. I don't love putting pies together, so instead I rolled out my pie dough and cut into 3 squares which I baked individually. We ladled the stew into bowls and topped with a piece of pie crust. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Question: Can I put the pies together and just not bake until tomorrow or will that make the bottom crust soggy? I don't really want to freeze them for just 24 hours. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is absolutely delicious! Comfort food at its best. Added four cups of potatoes but other than that , followed recipe. Made 3 pot pies. Will definitely be making again
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#OOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH MYYYYYYYYYYY Five stars are not enough to express how yummy this dish is! This smelled heavenly, and tasted even better! We had roast chicken on Sunday and I used the leftover meat and rich broth. I cut the recipe in half, since I only made one pie. I didn't have peas, so substituted cut fresh asparagus for the'green.' I also added garlic and bay leaves to the roux (removed before pouring into pie shell). It reminded me of one of those high end chicken pies from the freezer section, but with less calories. Thanks for the recipe Karen... it will definitely be a regular on our table! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Love that the recipe makes two pies, one to bake and one to freeze! I did substitute rosemary for thyme: it smelled Heavenly while baking.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Love that the recipe makes two pies, one to bake and one to freeze!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was soooo good! Made exactly to recipe, easy and the whole family loved it! The grandkids had seconds even! Definitely a keeper!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#First, this is called Baked Chicken Pie not pot pie - pot pie has no crust. My grandparents (born in 1904) were PA Dutch so I know this to be true. It is amazing how many things you can do with this recipe even using sea food. For the baked chicken pie, my grandmother always added a few hard boiled eggs, diced. Made the gravy silky and adds a extra punch. She also made gravy on the side in the event someone wanted their's extra moist. You cannot make and freeze these if you use hard boiled eggs. I make multiple small ones in the aluminum pans and freeze them. They are great to pull out and heat when it's snowing outside!! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Yumm..!!!! I made it exactly per the recipe minus the frozen corn (because I didn't have any). But I'm not sure it needed it. I may cut down on the thyme a bit next time, and I did use low sodium chicken broth. My husband says it's 10 Stars.. he says it's the best meal I've cooked! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was very good. I only used half of the thyme and made my own crust. Delicious. I used low sodium broth and no added salt.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is a great recipe. Easy to make and tastes really, really good! I made no changes this time. The next time it is made, I will cut down on the thyme. It's a bit too overpowering for me. Other than that.... spot on and delicious!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#So good! Really easy to prepare!!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Does this recipe make 2 pies?
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I've prepared this several times and made some changes to it, kicking it up a notch as Ina would say. First, I use only fresh veggies (except for the peas and pearl onions). It adds time but fresh carrots, parsnips, and Yukon Golds make a difference. Next, I add fresh mushrooms to the onion saute. To keep this flavorful I roast chicken breasts that have been very well seasoned. (Much better than rotisserie chicken and you can add the chicken juices to the stock, upping the flavor considerably.) I also add a glug of sherry (or white wine, whichever is handy) to the simmering sauce. Finally, I use the TOF site's buttery, flaky pie crust as the topper. It doesn't take long to make (and I only let it sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes) and is delicious on this pie. Yes, I've increased the work and time but if you do, this is likely the best pot pie that's going to come out of your kitchen. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#1#I've made this recipe twice now, both times as freezer meals for expecting mamas. If you don't like the way the filling tastes after you've added broth and milk, add spices (salt, pepper, sage, garlic, onion, etc). NOTE: This recipe makes a LOT of filling -- so use a large saucepan with high sides to cook, and have three pie shells ready, just in case. This recipe always turns into three pot pies for me. :) 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I don't usually do the cooking/ baking (as my husband is a much better cook). He asked for chicken pot pie today, I searched for recipes, and thought this one looked good. It was great- directions easy to follow, good flavor, (omitted the thyme and fresh carrot, used frozen veggies instead); he said it was the best meal I've ever made!. We both had seconds, and will see how second pie that we froze turns out in a week or two! Highly recommend this recipe! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#It was delicious! We added 1tbsp of Worcestershire sauce and 1 tbsp of garlic powder.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#NO! Bland and dry. Yes, I followed the recipe. Into the garbage after so much prep. Yes, I'm irritated. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is a fantastic pot pie recipe! I was really impressed with how well the frozen one baked up when I was ready to use it.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Made this today and my house smells so good. Gave one pot pie to my parents, my dad just called to say how good it was. Waiting to put ours in the oven when hubby leaves work. The filling is really good and was simple to make. My only change was I used green beans instead of peas (my dad hates peas) and used top crust only. Will absolutely make this again.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#The chicken filling is the absolute best I have tried and will definitely make again. As a personal preference though, the only thing I would change is to only use crust on the top, or top it off with puff pastry.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Wonderful Recipe, I served it for a ministry appreciation dinner. All the guests loved it as did my very finicky son in-law. I did alter it just a little by adding 2 Bay Leaves (removed before placing in casserole/ pie pan(s)) and 1 1/2 tsp Poultry Seasoning. I did this primarily because I was using rotisserie chicken and wanted to make sure I had full bodied flavor. This recipe is a keeper!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is the best chicken pot pie I have ever eaten! I don't usually write reviews, but I had to join TOH just to let everyone know that this recipe is amazing. I followed the recipe exactly as written and everything is just delicious; I wouldn't change a thing. The seasonings are just right, and it has become a staple in my house. My picky eaters love this, and my husband said that this is his favorite meal! Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Excellent, time consuming but so with it!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I love all the fresh ingredients! My kids love this, it's a good way to get some vegetables in them. The seasonings are perfect. I don't change a thing! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Awesome recipe!!My husband and son loves chicken pot pie and I typically buy them fresh from a warehouse club. Been wanting to make a pot pie from scratch and found this recipe. Made it last night and hands down it was the best pot pie they have ever had. I even ate it and I don't like pot pie!!Planning on making it agin and will swap out chicken with beef stew meat and beef broth. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Great pot pie! I used frozen mixed veggies and southern style hashbrowns to cut down on some of the prep.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Excellent recipe. I like to make a double batch and freeze the filling. Then I can make pies later when I'm having a busy week. This one is a keeper. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I made this recipe a couple weeks ago, but didn't buy the second pie crust. I froze the remaining mixture, and after getting a second crust, my other pie is now in the oven, and I can hardly wait to eat it! This is a very tasty recipe, and I plan on making it in the future! Thank you! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#just finished making this and it's one of the best Chicken Pot Pies I've ever eaten. Followed the recipe exactly and it's amazing.Most recipes online don't turn out so great but this one did.I'd let it sit a little longer than 15 min to set a little better but will be making this again and again. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I have tried many pot pie recipes and this is hands down the best. I clicked on some of the other reviews that were 1/2 stars because I couldn't imagine why no one would like this. My best guess if you think it is too flour-y or too much thyme, then maybe try again because honestly I make these for anyone who is sick, birthdays, neighbors....and they rave constantly. Maybe a misstep in the recipe was done. The directions are correct and I like that they have the frozen bake time! It is listed separate for easy understanding! I love being able to have a frozen option such as this instead of soup/chili all the time. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Scrumptious! I have been searching for a Chicken Pot Pie recipe and this one is a keeper! I didn't have any thyme so I substituted with poultry seasoning, using only half the amount required, perfect. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Excellent. So often we all make a small tweak in the recipe, but I made this just as the directions stated. Ok, I made one tiny change and used closer to 2 1/2 cups of potatoes rather than 2 cups, but those cubed potatoes were just sitting there on my cutting board.Very, very good. Even my'food particular' mother loved it and was willing to take home leftovers :-). 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Very, VERY good! I have never really liked other chicken pot pie's that I have had in the past. But my husband and daughter LOVE them, and they've been asking me to make it forever. When I saw the video for this recipe it looked easy enough and I had all the ingredients already. (I didn't realize this was a double recipe though!) since it made enough for two pot pies I gave one away and they really enjoyed it to. The only thing I will change next time is so skip the corn and add two cups of green peas just because I think it looks prettier with more green in it. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Made this today (half recipe) and loved it. I used a cup of the frozen hash browns instead of fresh potatoes and that worked fine. This is a keeper!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Chill the filling completely to keep the crust from being doughy.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#The cook time at the top doesn't match the bottom. An additional 75 minutes was not built into my planning time! I'll be eating at 10pm. Can't let you know how it is until then!Oh wait. I just reread this after reading several reviews and finding one that mentions time. That's the frozen pie option. Time to take it out of the oven! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I have made this often and it is a great dish. My father-in-law loves it and is always asking when I will be making again because he would love another one soon!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I've been making this recipe for the past year, it's absolutely delicious. I usually freeze one of the two, which I love. It's great knowing you have a meal ready in the freezer if needed. This meal is perfect for the colder seasons. I also appreciate that it's a recipe that you can throw in whatever veggies you have on hand. I love celery, so I'll saute celery with the onions and if I have green beans or anything else, I can make additions or adjustments with the veggie amounts. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is the best chicken pot pie recipe I have ever made. It is delicious and freezes well.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#In a word...FABULOUS!! Followed the recipe as is except halved for the two of us and, due to personal preference, left out the corn but put in extra carrots and potatoes.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is an excellent recipe. I did add three hard boiled eggs. I reduced the tymeand salt as suggested, and it was fabulous. I do recommend doubling the sauce through. It was too dry.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Made this the first time as written. I felt it was too salty and the thyme flavor was overwhelming. The second time I used sodium reduced broth, eliminated the salt, and cut the pepper and thyme to a 1/2 tsp. It came out perfect. It is definitely a keeper.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#It was absolutely delicious! My family of 7 devoured this! I did make my own crust. My husband and son said if I was to change anything, the only thing they would want was more chicken. I followed the recipe perfectly and I thought the seasonings were perfect as well as the amount of flour. (and I am not a meat fan, so I thought the amount of chicken was perfect)
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I made this recipe for the first time, it's by far the best pot pie recipe I've ever had/made. I ended up with enough filling for 3 pies based on the recipe, but I'm not complaining. It turned out perfect by following the recipe, not sure why other reviews indicate needing to use less flour or seasonings. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I always use my own pastry but the filling was spot on. This was a typical roux so am uncertain why many thought it was too much flour? As with any roux you must cook long enough with liquid to make it a somewhat thick but creamy white sauce before adding the other ingredients so maybe that is the case. Will definitely keep this in the wheelhouse of recipes!! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This one is a KEEPER! I've tried a lot of different recipes (almost each time I try a new one) - I think this one is the best yet. I followed what others have said and added less salt/pepper/thyme. (But love the thyme in it!) I doubled this recipe (I had just pulled apart 2 rotisserie chickens and had a lot of meat) and I could have made 3 decent size deep dish pot pies from that amount had I enough pie crust. As it was I ended up with 2 deep dish (probably over filled) pies -- with one going to the freezer. And I still some filling left over that I can make probably 3 mini pies from once I make more pie crust. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I loved this recipe ; however, cut the salt and pepper in half or at least I did; otherwise it would be too salty.Also, I have an electric oven and at 425 degrees, it only took 25 mins to bake. The amt of thyme was fine; my husband loved it and had two helpings. I didn't think it was too thick at all; it was perfect because you added a lot of liquid ingredients ( milk and chicken broth and butter)I didn't rate it a 5 only because the salt and pepper was way too much; definitely have to cut it in half. Otherwise it was excellent. Bon Appetit!!!! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Tasty, based on the other reviews used less flour and increased the spices a little.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#My family and I were not a fan of this recipe. It was so thick with all the flour and we couldn't taste anything but thyme. It was a bit salty as well. The seasonings were just overpowering. I think this would better suit my families tastes if the seasonings and flour were cut in half. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Awesome.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This recipe is fantastic and simple. I cut it in half and only added some extra seasonings to the original recipe. It turned out wonderful. My husband had his plate clean before I was halfway through. It's a keeper! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Love this recipe. I have made it three times and my family have commented how good it tastes. It is nice to use whatever you have on hand. One family member can't have corn so I just added mushrooms and celery. Love you can freeze one for later. It is in my recipe box as a keeper. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Yum! Great chicken pot pie recipe. Made my own homemade crust - recipe on Allrecipes (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/12492/pie-crust-iv/). Great consistency. Would add a little more spices.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Hands down THE best Chicken Pot Pie recipe out there!!!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Very good pie plus it makes two of them
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was awesome!! And, to have one for the freezer too is such a bonus. The thyme is the key ingredient that makes it unique & yummy.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Absolutely love this
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Love the previous reviewers idea of using the frozen pie crusts on the bottom and one package of the refrigerated crusts for the top. You are freeing up your pie plates from being in the freezer and if you take one to someone else, they don't have to return the plate! So good! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Absolutely FANTASTIC! This is the best recipe for Chicken Potpie and much rather use the amount of butter in this recipe than canned cream soups, which most potpie recipes use. I halved the recipe & followed the recipe exactly. However, right before putting it in the oven I brushed the top crust with egg wash. Karen, THANK YOU so much for sharing your recipe with us all.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I've made this recipe numerous times and it always comes out great! I cut the recipe in half and use half of the required flour amount because we like our gravy thinner. I add two tablespoons of white wine to the broth/milk mixture. I also only use one crust on top (no crust on the bottom). This recipe is a keeper! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This recipe is great. I made one pie then froze the rest to use in a new pie crust later.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Absolutely delicious and easy to make. Hearty meal that sticks to your ribs!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I always make these ahead and freeze them when I'm using up leftover chicken or turkey.I have one little trick I use, I buy two pre-made pie crusts and only one package of therefrigerated rolled out pie crust. I can freeze the pies, ready-to-bake without having to do so in my pie plates.I fill the ready made crusts with the filling, then brush the edges with egg wash, top with pie crust sheets and press firmly with fork to adhere together.This makes the perfect,'no clean up' dinner for busy days, especially during the holidays. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I've been making this Chicken Potpie for a few years now and can't believe I've never reviewed it. I only make half because there's just the two of us, but this is the only pot pie I ever make because it's easy, doesn't use canned soup, and taste excellent! If you don't have exactly what's in the recipe, you can substitute anything your heart desires and it's always good. Thanks, Karen Johnson, for making me look like a great cook! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Cut the recipe in half as only two of us. Excellent as is. I only added a bit of fresh ground nutmeg to the roux, just because I always add nutmeg to a roux. Not sure with the thyme I really needed it in this one. Also, needed bit more broth than stated or sauce gets to dry. Great dish! Update: On the warm up with leftovers did get very dry, if left overs next time will add a can of cream chicken soup, or make more roux. Still delicious even dry!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I made this pot pie for dinner, very good. I cut the recipe I half. Came out great. The next time I make it I'll make a looser gravy since we like lots of gravy in ours. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is a very good chicken potpie but be aware that it makes alot !- I was unable to fit it into 2 9 inch pie pans and used two larger deep dish rectangular dishes. I really like the flavor of the filling and the fact that nothing canned was used- all vegetables either fresh or frozen.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#DELICIOUS, EASY, ALSO FREEZES WELL
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is a GREAT recipe- the first chicken pot pie that my family really likes and requests. I have made it three times and it turns out perfect every time and warms up nicely the next day.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Very yummy! I halved and made one pie with home made crust and vegetarian chicken.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I am not normally a huge fan of chicken pot pie; however I had lots of Thanksgiving leftovers to use, so I thought I would try one. Well, boy and I glad I did! I am now a believer! This is the BEST chicken (or turkey!) pot pie I have ever eaten! Even my husband raved! I did leave out the corn, and probably lowered the amount of thyme (my shaker bottle wouldn't let me take the lid off, so I just poured a couple of shakes worth in the sauce). This recipe halves well, as I wasn't about to make 2 pot pies (see first comment about not liking pot pie). I will definitely make the full recipe next time and freeze one! Thanks for the amazing recipe!! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#OMG it was fabulous - I used sweet potatoes instead-just great
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This recipe is very easy and forgiving, and lends itself well to substitutions . I find the amount of filling is more than you need, so I make little puff pastry pockets whith what is left over and it is a big hit. I agree with other reviewers about the thyme and the butter, I use about half as much of both with a good result. I am no fan of store bought pastry, so I used the Betty Crocker two crust pie recipe which is deliciously flaky if somewhat tricky to roll, but if you put the dough between two pieces of parchment paper is comes out perfect.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I've made this pie on a couple of times and every time it gets rave reviews, even from the kids. I also like that I can freeze one or give it away. Great recipe and delicious! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Jeanettenfrench i substitute beef and beef broth all the time i use broth instead of milk also.i love this recipe have used it for a long time now.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#1#This is the best, like others I use my own pastry recipe. I have made it like stated which is great but I like it the best made with left over gravy and 1/4 to 1/2 cup of cream and less salt. My family love it. I make two, cook them both, eat one freeze one or give it away to friends or family. Thxs Karen Johnson
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I made this tonight, it tastes great! The consistency is perfect. I used almond coconut milk instead of regular milk and 3/4 cup butter instead of the full cup. I would agree with the other reviews to use less thyme as I did not, it is just a tad bit much if you use the whole teaspoon! I plan on freezing the other half of the filling to use at a later date with biscuits :-) Good luck!!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Can I make this with beef instead of chicken? And use beef broth for chicken??
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#We liked this very much. I made this recipe as stated. I followed the directions after freezing a pie and it took longer to bake then stated in recipe. Just be prepared for a longer bake time!!!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I made this for dinner tonight and everyone enjoyed it. The sauce was so good; what I liked most is that it didn't required canned soup. I used my own chicken broth and next time I will make my own crust. I prefer to cook from scratch and not used processed food. So good and perfect for a chilly night. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Would like to make for concession stand food. Can I use biscuits instead?
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was wonderful. Prepared as written, except I used homemade pie crust instead of store bought. It received rave reviews! Thank you for sharing!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This recipe is delicious! A keeper for sure. I used a rotissiserie chicken..and pilsbury pie crust..makes it fast and easy. The only thing i changed was i used Italian seasoning instead of thyme.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#have not made this pie yet, but wanted to ask if anyone has made this with a top crust only. Thanks, Sukie
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Yummy I use asparagus and use large cupcake pans for mini pies
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I have made this chicken pot pie recipe several times, and it is a HUGE hit in my household! Thick, creamy sauce and the thyme gives it just the perfect taste! On occasion, I have used Bisquick to make the crust, giving it more of a doughboy type of topping. Whether you choose to make the filling and doughboys for a chicken stew, or follow the crust directions for a pot pie, both are absolutely delicious!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is a Five Star recipe! It is Super! Everyone ate this down and then ate seconds! I've made this often since it is now requested all the time. I make both pies with my own pie pastry recipe with great results. Even served this to my guests who all were very impressed : ) 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This. Is. Amazing. I make my own crusts and throw in whatever I have for ingredients and seasoning. But I love the white sauce combo of butter, flour, milk and broth. This recipe is so versitle! I've made it 4 times so far and never used the same veggies/meat/spices. And it always turns out great! Makes one to eat and one to freeze. Ps. My 2 year old loves this! This last time I used: salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Mrs dash garlic for seasonings (about a tsp each), chicken for meat, carrots, sweet potatoes, and a bag of frozen mushroms, broccoli and beans. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Very good. I mixed in a little cheese as well and next time I'll add chopped cooked bacon. Keeper recipe for sure! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Nice recipe with lots of flavor. The filling is thick enough that it does not run out in the pan when you cut it. Definitely a keeper!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Great recipe and so easy!! The first time I made it I cut the recipe in half and made one pie. The second time I made it I cut the recipe in half and made three small 51/2 inch individual pies. The next time I will make the full recipe and make individual pies and freeze some. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a little extra broth to make it more creamy. I absolutely love this recipe! This is my go-to Chicken Pot Pie Recipe!! Thank you for sharing!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Very yummy! My SIL wanted chicken pot pie and this was a complete hit!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Question: How does the baking instructions change after you freeze the pie?
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Very easy to follow and truly fantastic. Go easy on the thyme, maybe just bake the chicken with rosemary and thyme and not stick it directly into the roux. and don't dice the potatoes too small or they kind of turn into a mash when baked. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is a five star pie.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is a family favorite! It is versatile and is a good basic recipe which allows for changing up the vegetables or even meats used. The sauce/gravy is delicious and not too heavy - easy to prepare so no need to use canned soups. It is true comfort food and we enjoy it year around! I would like to say that the second pie makes it to the freezer, but it often doesn't! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Excellent recipe and easy to make. I cut the recipe in half and make one pot pie.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Excellent! Thank you so much for this yummy recipe! Changes I made: I only used 1/2 cup of butter. I added fresh asparagus I large diced and roasted the asparagus and the carrots together. Also added celery and saut?ed that with the onion. One can of corn instead of frozen. Used 4 cups of broth instead of 3. I used half & Half instead of milk. Also used Whole Wheat flour as I was out of white flour. Very pleased we could not taste the difference in the flour and will use it again when making this.My husband said Marie Callender's (a chain famous for their pies and pot pies) should use this recipe! Thanks again! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Great recipe. I agree with the comments that a homemade crust would be even better. I used Pilsbury refrigerator pastry crust and it turned out pretty good. Very easy to pull together and the best part, knowing there is another pie in the freezer!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This pie had rave reviews from my family--everyone loved it! My only change was that the sauce got a little too thick so I added more chicken stock. Came out perfect!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#OMG. What. A. Recipe. To-die-for delicious! I want to add a photo of my pie, but there appears to be no manner in which to do so.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This recipe was absolutely wonderful. I rolled my own crust so it took me a little longer. My whole family loved it. Even my very picky soon-to-be-10yr old liked it and asked for more.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This recipe was fantastic! It took me one hour including the pastry dough( I used chef Ramsey quick puff pastry recipe) . My adjustments were ...I used baby potatoes with skin ,1 can of corn, 1 cup of peas, and 1 cup of vanilla almond milk. I used an extra 1/2 cup of chicken broth to compensate for the thickness of the almond milk.I did not use thyme or carrots because they are flavors my family does not enjoy!Bon Appetite!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Tasty Comfort Food . Substantial meal for a cold day. My husband loved it. The prep time is not accurate if you peal and cut your own potatoes, onions and carrots, count on prep time of at least 1 1/2 hours. If you buy a rotisserie chicken from Costco or another store , you need to buy two chickens for this recipe. This recipe makes 2 LARGE pies. It's enough, supposedly, to feed 16 people, but realistically 2 pies will feed about 8-10 adults because you will eat more than an eighth of a pie! We are average adults and the two of us ate a half of a pie... it's so heavy that you will not need anything else other than the pie for dinner. The diced potatoes get lost in the pie- maybe I should cut them in larger pieces next time. This would be a great hit for a pot luck. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Wow this was phenomenal! I actually ran out of all-purpose flour for the first time in my life! I had to work with whole wheat flour. I made my own crust-highly recommend- and the filling was just perfect. My husband said this was Amazing! My go-to recipe was the All-American Turkey Pot pie on TOH, but this one wins! However, I will continue to make the crust from the turkey recipe-its to die for!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#A win with my family.... my husband was tasting before it went in the oven and said it can be eaten just like that....thanks for sharing this recipe.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Made this last night. Everybody loved it! I added another 1 tsp of salt because what was called for in the recipe just wasn't enough ( this took the flavor from just ok to yummy), and I was out of peas so I used cut green beans. Prep time took me a little longer than I expected but was worth it in the end because I get two pies out of the deal. I also ran short on crust (I had already used one crust for a pumpkin pie, so I only had 3 and needed 4), so instead of fully covering both pies, I just used cookie cutters on the 3rd crust and covered most of the surface of both pies with snowmen and gingerbread men shapes; kids loved it. Filling comes out firm so it doesn't spill all over. Also, even though boxed crust says to cook at 450, I did what the recipe said and did 425 for 35 mins (in gas oven) and it was perfect. This will be my go- to chicken pot pie recipe! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Tasted okay. My family liked but next time, no thyme.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Sounds so good but I am going to try boiling the vegs in some of the chicken broth, using the broth as directed after Draining . It should give it a better flavor
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I made this last night and my family absolutely loved it it was the first time my kids ever had chicken pot pie I used mix vegetables instead of the carrots and peas separate and added celery salt I made 2 pies and it was all gone in 35 min great recipe after that my wife wants me to cook every night
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is a fantastic recipe. It is one of my go-to recipes when making a meal for a friend.. I can make one and have an extra to take to someone or leave in the freezer for a busy night.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is great! I made my own crust and it was much better. I also used our leftover turkey from thanksgiving, which is now becoming a tradition that the whole family loves. Much better than turkey sandwiches every day for a week.I cut back on the butter (by half) and used sour cream in lieu of milk as we never seem to have milk in our house. It turned out great! It's hard to find a recipe that produces a thicker pie (versus a thin one). I will always use this recipe from now on! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was a super recipe. Very tasty. Even my picky 5 yr old wanted more.I just have to work on perfecting my pie crust!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This recipe is fantastic! I made this as written, but for one pie. I used the breast meat from a Costco chicken and a bag of mixed vegetables to make it easier. I am going to make the filling again tomorrow and will toss it into the freezer for busy days.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I loved this recipe! Only made one Chicken potpie and saved the rest to serve over mashed potatoes. Very tasty!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I made this last night and my family was wowed! It is hearty and tasty and for my large family we are always having to double recipes. This one made plenty for dinner and for lunch leftovers. It totally hits the spot when you are looking for a fall comfort food recipe..
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is an extremely delicious recipe !!! My husband ate an entire pie to himself in one day for breakfast lunch and dinner ! I am currently going to the market now to gather the ingredients to make more! A major hit in my household!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Delicious A fair amount of prep work, but the results are worth it. Thick, creamy, flavorful
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is a really good recipe. My husband absolutely loved it and so did my boys. You have got to try it.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#flavor was perfection .
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Really good! Def. the best pot pie I have ever had. I am a vegetarian so I swapped out the chicken for mushrooms and the chicken broth for vegetable broth. Amazing! Thank you. Great end of work week/Friday night comfort food meal.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is the best chicken potpie, my kids would never eat potpie , now they ask for it.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was great! Actually made it twice in one week. First time I only made 1/2 the recipe because it is only me and my younger son. It was gone by the next morning. Today I made the full recipe, I am working all weekend and wanted something here for him easy to heat up. The ONLY variations I made were using 1 tsp of pepper instead of 3/4 and fresh thyme instead of dried. Try it!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I absolutely loved this! i made it for my family and although it took a while, it was worth it! I used a rotisserie chicken from Albertsons and just used the chicken breasts. Instead of canned or fresh chicken stock i used Chicken Bouillon. I also used a bottom and top biscuit crust . (Biscuit Crust Recipe: http://www.food.com/recipe/chicken-pot-pie-with-biscuit-crust-26846) To keep the crust from getting soggy i baked the bottom crust for about 15 minutes before adding the filling. It only needed to bake for 30-35 minutes.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#My boys loved this. I omitted the milk in the filling because there seemed to be plenty of liquid already.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Every one enjoyed. Found recipe very easy. Also liked they told you wine to serve.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Good chicken pie!! I wasn't sure I had frozen peas and didn't want to dig through the deep freeze to see if I could find any, so I substituted frozen chopped broccoli so there would be some green in it. I was going to make my own pie crust, but decided not to bother because I had some biscuit mix, so I mixed some up and dropped biscuits over the top of the casserole. I cut down on the thyme, added maybe an eight of a teaspoon since I don't like things too heavily seasoned. Also, I halved everything as I just wanted one pie. Delish!! Will make again, and next time will probably make a pie crust from scratch when I'm not as rushed for time. Another thing....I don't think it needs a bottom crust, just one over the top. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#You will never make another chicken pot pie after making this one! It is well worth the effort! If using frozen pie shells (like the tenderflake), I find I can get three pies out of this recipe! I also add chopped parsnips with the carrots and then cut down on the frozen veggies. The richness of the sauce is just incredible! Even my one year old eats an entire piece!!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was wonderful...perfect combination of ingredients and very flavorful. It does take a while to put together, but a lot can be done ahead, e.g. cook and freeze individual bags of chicken to have on hand. To save time, I just bought packaged veggies (2) and added the chicken and potato. My husband loved it!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I know this may seem crazy to ask, but when it says poor the potatoe mixture in, is it talking about the water you cook the potatoes in??
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was delicious, and I turned it vegan. Substituted soy milk and soy butter, faux chicken strips, but essentially the same. I did put a little more pepper and salt in to counteract the sweetness of the soy milk. In any case, it was a huge hit b
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Fantastic! My whole family loved the flavor. Definitely a keeper.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This recipe was perfection! My husband could not say enough good things about it! He said Now this is what a chicken pot pie should taste like! I followed the recipe exactly. I did use Yukon Gold potatoes instead of a regular baking potato. At first, I thought I would cut the recipe in half as I didn't think I needed two pies worth, but I am so glad I went ahead and made both. The chopping is a bit time consuming, so I am glad that now I will get two meals out of this one night of work. I put the other pie in the freezer for the future and cannot wait to have it for a simple meal a few weeks from now. Loved this! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#My husband told me this recipe was a keeper and i can't take the leftovers to work. I am really glad I picked this recipe to try. We loved it!!! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Really filling. I added some dill and parsley flakes for some more flavor. And I added some poultry seasoning to the broth for a little chicken flavor boost. Baked pie came out wonderful. Second pie into the freezer. Hope to enjoy that next month!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was delicious and satisfying! I used my own crust recipie so I could make one large pie instead of two. Total hit and my family loved it! Great comfort food!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#fantastic! So good, don't get to freeze the second pie. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Made it for dinner tonight, delicious! My family loved.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#1#This was super good and easy - this was the first recipe I've used to make a chicken pot pie and it's a keeper. However, the second time I made this, I used only one crust and made more of the broth/gravy mixture - I froze this one to cook later. I followed the how to cook the frozen pie instructions but my pie was still cold after it should've been ready - it took an additional 45 minutes and I increased the oven temperature. It was still tasty - just disappointed it took a long time too cook through. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was pretty good! My 1st attempt at making a chicken pot pie and it turned out. It was very easy to make too, so that was nice. I will make a few changes next time and see how it goes. I'll probably do less Thyme and will try homemade crust but all in all...very good recipe. Will be making again! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is still a 5 star. Having it for Christmas Dinner this year per family request.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is the pot pie recipe I always use because it is so rich and satisfying. I use half the butter and flour, and add a few more herbs and some white pepper. I love that the recipe makes two pies! I make one for us, and one to bless another family.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I've made this three times now and my family still raves about how much they love it!! Full of flavor, drives me crazy waiting for it bake! I highly recommend this recipe! The leftovers reheat just as tasty!!! Wonderful cold weather comfort food! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was delicious! Everyone had seconds. The only downside was my largest frying pan, which is quite large, was not big enough. I would suggest using a Dutch oven instead.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was a great dish! I didn't have any milk so I used cream of chicken instead. It made the filling very think but it tasted fantastic. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Love this recipe. Get so many compliments when i make it.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was so good! I wasn't sure how the leftovers would be, but they were just as good as the first day it was cooked. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was a huge hit with my family (even my husband who has never been a fan of chicken potpie)! It took some time to prep, but it was well worth the effort. I love freezer cooking so having a pie for the freezer was a definite plus! I used deep dish pie crusts and this made 2 very full pies. Delicious!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was a huge hit with my family (even my husband who has never been a fan of chicken potpie)! It took some time to prep, but it was well worth the effort. I love freezer cooking so having a pie for the freezer was a definite plus! I used deep dish pie crusts and this made 2 very full pies. Delicious!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was so good & easy to make! I only used 1 pie crust per pie & left out the thyme. It's nice to know I have one pie in my freezer for a busy night. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#My family did not care for it the first time I made it because of the thyme, one whole pie went to waste Made it again without the thyme, loved it, no leftovers this time. Loved the ease of the refrigerated pie crust.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Very tasty and filling. Great way to use up leftover chicken. I used evaporated skim milk for the milk which gave it an extra creamy taste without adding any more fat and I used fresh thyme and a heavy sprinkle of poultry seasoning. I made four deep dish individual pies and I could only eat half of one.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Excellent flavor, the gravy would be good on other dishes as well. I only used a top crust.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I followed the amounts given and could have made 3 pies! Next time, I will not add the potatoes - just a personal flavor choice. And I suggest allowing the filling to cool before adding the top crust. Looking forward to trying this with other poultry and veggie combos.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#We had this for dinner tonight. We loved it. I added fresh garlic with the onion. Next time, I plan on adding chopped celery. Delicious.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Great recipe but for our family I will omit the thyme next time. I did increase the broth by 1 cup to make it creamier.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This recipe is delicious!!!! My husband LOVES it and so do I! I like that it makes 2 potpies. I usually make one and freeze the other for another night!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is a delicious pot pie recipe, my husband absolutely adored it. I frequently halve the recipe to feed just my family but when there is a new mom or a friend under the weather this is the perfect meal to take to them and still have dinner for your family as well. You can never go wrong with classic comfort food.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I apologize, but the amount of thyme you called for was ridiculous. It drowned out every other flavor including the whole chicken we smoked the day before. The idea of the roux-based `gravy` was well constructed, but I used less flour than what the recipe called for, and I found the consistency a bit much. I love the idea of adding potatoes though. The lesson this girl learned today? Stay away from actual written recipes, use your gut instinct, and remember kids, your fingers do the best measuring when cheffing it up :) ONELOVE
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Super easy and made it Sunday for the week. Added a bit of garlic power to the mix and baled the chicken in packets with olive oil, salt and pepper along with a bit of chopped garlic...yum! Loving it now!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This recipe is AMAZING. My family can't eat any other pie after making this. I can typically get three pies out of this recipe, but only because we like a little less filling. This is by far my most requested recipe!! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was so yummy!! I actually made it in to mini pot pies using a muffin tin. They were perfect size for my kids, who really liked it. I just halved the recipe and used a 4 inch round cutter for the bottom and a 3 inch round for the top and cut it out of the store-bought pie crust. I also brushed the tops with an egg wash.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Phenomenal! Halved the ingredients to make one deep pie as well. I didn't use as much flour either because I noticed the filling to be too thick so I used extra broth to compensate. This was delicious:) 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was great! The first pie was wonderful, and we had the other one last night.... cooked that one for an hour at 425 with no temp change and it came out fine!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Best Chicken Pot Pie!! Very creamy and hearty. Recipe was easy to follow. Freezes very well!! Have made with chicken and also with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. Will make this again and again!!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Also, I added a bit extra pepper and salt while mixing before putting everything in the pies. It was to dull down the overpowering thyme, which did help prior to baking. It was strong after, obviously.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was great, except I felt it called for a bit too much thyme so I will make it with less next time. But otherwise it was delicious.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I have been making this recipe for years. Definitely one of my favorites. Love having one in the freezer for later.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was my first time making a homemade pot pie. It turned out great! I halved the recipe and made one deep dish pie and had no leftover filling. The only change I will make is to use a little bit more chicken broth for the gravy, mine ended up just a little too thick (even before the boiling/thickening stage).
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#First time I ever made a Chicken Potpie. It was excellent. My husband and kids enjoyed it and want me to make it all the time. Thank you for sharing.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I made this on 1-3-13 and it was delicious. I cut the recipe in half and only made one pie, as I was unsure if it would turn out & it tasted great!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This turned out so good! I did a few things different though...I used 3/4 cup flour, and I bought a premade rotisserie chicken from the store and used that. Also, instead of using a crust, I baked it for 45 minutes then top it with unrolled cresent rolls and baked until the cresent rolls were golden. Mmmm so good! Will def make again
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#We also had enough filling for a third pie. We found that the crust browned before the bottom crust was done cooking, but we rather enjoyed the creaminess it added. If we make it again we would likely cut the thyme in half and add a second seasoning. It was just a lot of the same flavor.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was so good. I can't wait to make the second one thats in the freezer. I would put less thyme in it, if any. But I will be making this again. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was one of the best chicken pot pie recipes I've ever used! My daughter loves pot pies, and this one had a real chicken broth gravy and was seasoned just right and really brought the flavors out of the chicken and the vegetables. I will definitely make this again. Plus, it was nice to have an extra to freeze for a future dinner! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I cut up the chicken in cubes and sauteed it in some olive oil and sprinkled a little Adobo on it. Once I added the broth to the recipe I also added about a teaspoon full of chicken base to the sauce (Better Than Bouillon). Also I did have to add a little bit extra broth to help thin the filling out a little bit. My family and friends loved this!!!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This was crazy easy to make!! I found though that it filled THREE regular pie shells. Probably two deep dish ones. Reheats beautifully and the seasoning is perfect!!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Really, really good. Used 1/2 cup ea of butter & flour as recommended. Did not have frozen corn so substituted sauted mushrooms & celery and did not use a bottom crust. Poured a portion of it (kept remainder for another day) into an 8-1/2 x 9 dish, covered w/ one rolled out sheet of puff pastry, sprinkled w/ minced fresh parsley & paprika, baked @ 375 for 70 min. 6 servings - our guests went back for seconds! Great w/ double cheese bread & spinach salad. A keeper!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Absolutely the best chicken pot pie ever. I make this often and use whatever veggies I have on hand and it always turns out great. I use store bought crusts to speed the process and usually only make one pie and use the extra filling as either gravy on top of the pie or on biscuits or toast later. Excellent recipe!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#MMMM.. best chicken potpie! Gravy is delicious. Great for company!!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Yup. That was the best darn chicken pie I've ever eaten. And one to share - even better! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Yup. That was the best darn chicken pie I've ever eaten. And one to share - even better! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Yup. That was the best darn chicken pie I've ever eaten. And one to share - even better! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Yup. That was the best darn chicken pie I've ever eaten. And one to share - even better! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This has been a family favorite since I first made it when I received this issue of Quick Cooking. We have 6 children, so both pies would go in a single meal when all the kids were home! Now I can usually freeze one for later--unless some of my sons find out I'm making this & decide to come home for supper that night! I substitute 2 cups of frozen corn for the peas as my husband hates most vegetables. I've also made it with only the potatoes & onions. And, I use 1 tsp. of poultry seasoning instead of thyme because I don't like the flavor of thyme. My youngest daughter made it on her own for her 13th birthday because I only had the use of one arm at that time--I talked her through it & she was very proud of the compliments she received! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Seriously, only use half the butter it calls for (1/2 cup instead of 1 cup) it is still plenty rich and creamy. It was great.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Very tasty! My friends loved it!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is the BEST! I did cut back the butter by 1/2 a stick. I usually double this and make two 9 x 13 pans using homemade pie crust. I also just use frozen carrots and skip the potatoes due to a family allergy, but it does speed the process up a little bit :)
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This recipe should have WAY more ratings! A little time consuming to make but SO worth it! The frozen pie turns out great as well!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#The Best Chicken Potpie Ever!! The first time we prepared this it was great. The second time and after we knew what we were doing...it was the best!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#A real crowd pleaser. This is the best chicken pot pie recipe. I add extra peas because the everyone likes them.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#It was great! Turned out to be a little more work than I thought, but was well worth it!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#My husband and I made this receipt this past weekend. Chicken Potpie is one of my favorite comfort foods and this recipe is the best I've ever had. Will definitely be adding it to my recipe box. Thanks for sharing this recipe!! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is really yummy comfort food. I've made it twice now & my 4 kids love it. I usually make my own pie crust but I used the store bought to save time and couldn't believe how good this was (and easy). 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I have done it and I am not so happy, it has called a lot of butter and flour so it has strong flour taste and very rich.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I made this for the first time at the weekend, and It really exceeded my expectations. I was amazed at how easy and ridiculously tasty this was. I made my own pastry from scratch and can't wait to make this again!!! Thanks for sharing! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is the best pot pie. Ever. I plan on using leftover turkey in it after Thanksgiving.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#So delicious! My family loves this and it's so easy to make. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Very easy to make and it is super delicious! My whole family enjoys it and I enjoy them eating vegetables without arguing.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I poached the chicken in broth & water with lots of poultry seasoning. I also added 1 tsp. of thyme, poultry seasoning & salt to the mix. It was absolutely fabulous!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#a very yummy comfort food
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I made this pie for my family and they loved it. I froze the other half and then made it for a work potluck and everyone wanted the recipe. I did change it a bit, instead of peas I put in frozen broccolli and made it with a homemade crust instead of store bought. Absoultely a keeper recipe.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is very good. I plan to make it again for our Church Potluck. Thank you Karen Johnson.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I make this potpie all of the time. It is our favorite meal. It is DELICIOUS! I make it for people who are ill or have had a baby and it's perfect because there is one for them and one for my family. Every single time I make it I get a request for the recipe. I saute the chicken in good spices and chop for the best flavor. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This potpie would have been delicious but I thought it had way too much thyme. I will try again with only a smidgeon of thyme.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#My family loved this recipe. I think my 17 yr old had 4 helpings, and my husband, who usually doesn't like this, had 2 helpings. I will definitely make it again. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Great tasting and easy to make. I only wanted to make 1 pie, so I halfed the recipe and it worked out great.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I tested several pot pie recipes before settling on the best for my recipe box --- and here it is! It's my go-to recipe for taking to new moms or shut-ins, because the double recipe allows me to make dinner for my family and theirs. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is the best potpie recipe. I share this one alot.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#When I want to make Chicken Pot Pie, this is the recipe I turn to. I have thought about reducing the butter a touch to cut down on the fat-that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5-it seems like a bit too much butter in the filling. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Doubled the recipe and got 5 pies out of it!! Cooking for a very large harvest crew and it was a hit! They all loved it. To save time I used canned chicken. Great recipe! Love that it makes lots. I will use this recipe long after harvest. Its great to have extra in the freezer for those days when you dont feel like cooking!!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I'm rating this as a 5 even though I haven't tasted it yet. Right before summer I made one of these..put in all in a very deep dish pie shell, but it got hot and my husband didn't want me to heat up the house, so I gave it to my son and dtr in law and told them to bake it. They told me it was the best pot pie they had ever had and it was gone within 24 hrs. It's just the two of them!!! Gonna make one for me and hubby this week and freeze the other one as recommended. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Made this last night. My family told me this one is a keeper. I bought 2 9 inch deep dish pie crust and I had enough filling to make 3 pot pies and gave one to my neighbor. I will definitely make this one again!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I tested other potpie recipes, trying to find the perfect one.... this is by far the best, and the one that made it's way into my permanent recipe collection. This is one of my favorite dishes to take to new moms or shut-ins, because it's a double recipe -- one for my family, and one for theirs. It's delicious! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#Forgot to add that I used only 1/2 cup of butter (by accident) and it turned out just as good.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I absolutely love this recipe and so does my husband. I double the amount of Thyme and black pepper. If I'm short on time I will use 2 15 oz cans of mixed veggies in place of the potatoes, carrots, corn and peas. I also like to use fat free half-and-half if I have it on hand. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#My husband and son both loved it! I used a Pillsbury crust and a left-over store bought bbq chicken. My husband grew up on homemade potpies and his Mom is the best pastry maker I know, so I was ready for an It's okay but got a Wow, this is really good. One of the best I've ever had . He even went as far to say that he was a little hesitant when I said that I was making a chicken potpie (don't know where that came from as I'm a good cook!) Another plus is that it made two good sized pies. 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I adapted the recipe and skipped the potatoes and carrots. I in turn used 4 cups of frozen mixed vegetables to make this truly a quick fix. My family loves it so much, that the 2nd pie doesn't make it to the freezer any more!! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is a wonderful pot pie. My husband and son loved it; there was none left from the one pie.
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#by far the best homemade potpie I have ever made. We really, really loved it!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#I love this recipe and use it frequently!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is the best recipe! My freezer cooking group uses this every time we get together. We have also adapted it to using beef stew meat. To make things really easy we buy deep dish pie crusts and top with Pillsbury refrigerated rolled pie crusts. Packed into a 1 gallon freezer bag and labeled with instructions, they are so nice for giving to families in need as well as my own home!
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This turned out GREAT! I used less expensive ground beef instead of the more expensive chicken. I also made my own pie crust with my favorite recipe. The frozen pie tasted like it had never been frozen. I don't need to look for another pot pie recipe! THIS IS IT! 
Favorite Chicken Potpie#0#0#This is my favorite potpie recipe. It's great to make when I need some homemade comfort food. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Anyone tried baking the chicken in the oven? Whenever I try to fry on a skillet pan, my chicken is always raw in the middle. Thanks
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#Amazing flavor and easy to make.  2 thumbs up from everyone.  
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#So delicious! The whole family agreed- this is our favorite homemade recipe!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#7#0#This recipe is a KEEPER. I have made it with chicken, steak, and shrimp. For the steak I added cilantro to the marinade. It always tastes super fresh. If you are a camper, this is a great and easy recipe bc you can marinade the chicken slices while they are in your cooler, and if you cut up more onions and peppers, you can make kebabs for a 2nd dinner and save money and cooler space. I honestly love this recipe. Its a go to.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#3#1#everyone really loved this - i marinated chicken breasts for a few hours in this (i forgot to add the lemon juice and used regular kosher salt because thats what i had on hand), then i cooked the chicken on the grill. i didn't marinate the peppers but will next time. also will try it with shrimp and will do the chicken peppers and onions on one sheet pan all together if i'm not grilling 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#5#4#These were amazing!!! I made them for my teenage son and his friends. They didn't even sit down, just stood around the table eating! The chicken is wonderful on salads as well. I followed the recipe pretty closely, though I doubled the marinade to make extra chicken. I also ended up marinating the chicken for 3 days. It tasted great! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#4#0#So easy and so good. My first time to make this and I will definitely make it again.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I really enjoyed this recipe, my husband told me to remember this one.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#3#0#I have made this dish soooo many times over the past couple of years. It always turns out so great. Personally I put the marinade in the skillet with the chicken. Probably the best chicken recipe I've ever made and it's pretty easy! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#5#6#FANTASTIC!! Ever since I discovered this recipe in my Taste of Home magazine, I've made it at least once a month. I serve it over copycat Chipotle cilantro lime rice. I double the marinade, and don't throw it away so there's a bit of sauce for the rice. Seriously one of the best things I've ever eaten!! Everyone I've served it to loves it!! Quick, delicious meal for impressing dinner guests. Quick, delicious meal for impressing your family! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#8#0#Delicious why eat fajitas out when their so easy and cheap to make at home!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#2#0#All of my family loved this recipe! Will definitely make again.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#1#Sounds Great.. Have to try!!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#18#5#Super delicious! Just wondering: When you write 1-1/2 teaspoons. Is that 1.5 teaspoons? 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#4#13#This is an excellent recipe, especially if you're a beginner. It tastes way better than buying them ready made. I would however suggest only making this if you're used to spicy food because the amount of chili in this recipe is far more than regular taste buds can handle so If you're thinking about following this recipe you should half the amount of chili you use . But for the rest this recipe is perfect!! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#2#0#Excellent recipe, have made it many times with chicken, but this time I used shrimp & scallops and it was amazing!! Served it with Cilantro Lime Rice & homemade salsa...delish!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#Made this recipe tonight with the bean and corn salad to Rave reviews. This will definitely be part of the dinner rotation. Thanks for sharing.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#5#6#I left the lemon juice and paprika out when I marinated, and I marinated the chicken overnight. I did not use peppers, because we are allergic to them. I did the rest of the recipe as written. It was very delicious and tasted just like the fajitas you get at a restaurant. I served it with Mexican rice and refried beans. I will be making this recipe again.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#5#1#Excellent recipe! Simple and delicious!!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#5#2#Good go to recipe.... I sometimes use cubes of Salmon fillet instead of chickenand just follow the recipe ...It really works
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#13#0#Have been making this almost weekly for years. I prep the veggies and chicken on Sunday, and then just need to cook it Monday night after work. Makes great leftovers for lunch the next day.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#4#0#Delicious fajitas! We loved them, thank you for posting!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#9#9#The video shows no green onions. It's an odd choice for fajitas. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#15#3#Very easy and delicious. I used onion strips rather than cubed to go with pepper strips. I had smoked chicken breasts (so pre-cooked) that I cut into strips and marinaded for an hour. They absorbed the marinade and were incredible. These marinated strips are great by themselves and could be used on salads, in a pasta etc. I'll use this marinade with smoked chicken breasts by themselves now. So delicious. Fajitas were great too. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#7#1#I make this recipe about once a week. We all love it. A great use for leftovers is to use it as a pizza topping! I buy a whole wheat pizza dough, Muir glen pizza sauce and mozzerella, and top with left over fajita chicken and onions and peppers. It is SOOOOO delicious!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#40#4#I love Mexican style meals better than my wife but she gave these five stars also. I complimented these with refried beans (recipe compliments of Ree Drummond), arroz rojo aka red rice (recipe compliments of Marcela Valladolid) and quacamole. For the two of us this was to much to eat for one meal but it was excellent the next day. Two tips: the refried beans freeze well for use at a later date, if you have plenty of left over quacamole smooth it out on top and gently add a thin layer of water, the next day pour the water off and you have quacamole that didn't turn brown. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#13#3#We love Mexican meals and this is a very easy and tasty recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and served with cheddar cheese, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. We had this meal last week and my 8 year old grandson couldn't get enough. He likes being able to add only the toppings he wants. One family member skipped the tortilla and saved herself some carbs. In the future, I will also offer black beans or refried beans and rice. Yummy! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#8#0#I normally don't leave reviews but this recipe was so good everyone ate it! My kids are picky but their plates were wiped clean and my husband doesn't really care for chicken breast but said who ever created this recipe is genius!! Very good!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#6#0#These are really good and easy to make. I need to make it more often. Even my husband who is tolerant at best of chicken breast said they were'good'. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#4#0#This is so delicious and so easy. Definitely will make every week! Thank you for making my life better with this easy and fun to make recipe!! It's totally awesome! Will never buy fajita seasoning again!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#71#Absolutely lovely. Chicken fajitas are one of my all time favorite. BUT 30 grams of carbs is 2 days of carbs for me, so it's out of my eating range :( 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#3#0#Absolutely KILLER! was a huge hit with the family. I let it marinate overnight and cooked in a grill pan (on the stove). Will definitely make this again.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#3#0#Tubes of biscuits ???where does it mention that???
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#4#1#This recipe is fabulous! I give it 5 stars and I didn't change a thing, followed it exactly. My husband exclaimed, these are really flavorful! And he didn't even know that was the recipe title! So, these fajitas are aptly named and absolutely delicious. I ate one the next day for breakfast, that's how good! ;) 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#2#0#The marinade adds so much flavor to the chicken! Building your own fajitas is a really fun option when you have dinner guests or just for a normal nightly dinner.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#16#Looks lovely but you cannot buy tubes of biscuits in the uK . Would help to give a recipe for them or a link to one. Thank you
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#2#0#I ended up making this two nights in a row because everyone loved it so much! The first night, I forgot to add the paprika to the marinade so I added to the chicken right before cooking it. I thought it was more flavorful doing it that way. I might try not marinading at all next time.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This Fajita recipe is so full of flavor everytime! It has become a regular on our Family's menu! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#3#2#Love this recipe, been using it for years. More recently, in an attempt to increase our vegetable consumption, I add a couple of zucchini squash, sliced in 4-5 long spears, which I cook with the onions and peppers. Makes a great and healthy addition. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#2#1#A family favorite!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#15#0#What I love about this recipe is that you probably have everything in your pantry. We make this at least once a week. I live with 2 20 something guys and they LOVE fajita bar night. I cook the chicken first and then the veggies after so it picks up all that good chicken flavor. I serve it'bar' style, I cut up tomatoes, avocado, lettuce, shredded cheese, guac, salsa, sour cream, etc and let everyone build their own fajita. This marinade is also excellent with shrimp. It is so good I have started putting all of the spices into baggies, and then when I want to make the fajitas I just have to add the oil and lemon juice and go. 10/10 highly recommend 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#1#Tried this as a change from our old style of fajitas. We happened to have all the ingredients on the shelf at home. Really great taste and fairly easy to make. Definitely will be having this dish again soon!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#3#0#Excellent! I made it last week, chicken and beef, and even the leftovers were tasty. We're having it again tonight. This will be on the menu several times a month. I'm going to make up a big supply of the spices, to save time.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#Very flavorful and would definitely make again. We prefer less chili spice (we prefer a milder taste) so I cut the chili powder in half (1/4 tsp) and left out the optional red pepper. It was perfect!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Delicious and so easy! May need to add to our weekly rotation.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#10#0#I cheat like hell out of sheer laziness and cut the prep time in half, and this is still a hit with the whole family. Rather than slicing and cooking chicken, peppers, and onions, I use Trader Joe's 12oz grilled chicken strips from the refrigerated section and a bag of their frozen Fire Roasted Peppers & Onions. I just cut the chicken strips into smaller strips to make them fit better in the tortilla and marinate them exactly as in the recipe. When the chicken is done marinating, I just heat up the peppers n onions for about 10 minutes and then dump in the chicken to get it warm and it's done and delicious. I also use Trader Joe's whole wheat low-carb tortillas that work and taste great in this recipe while saving some calories. Doing it this way, total prep and cook time is about 20 minutes, but if you don't tell anyone they'll think you actually worked hard making it. I love cheating.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#1#I love this chicken fajitas and i'll definately try this chicken fajitas recipe this weekend. The best thing about this recipe is that it takes very less time in making this recipe. Even i have a special chicken fajitas stuffed pepper recipe as well. Check out the recipe here: https://www.recipespack.com/chicken-fajita-stuffed-peppers-recipe/ 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#3#0#My across-the-street neighbor and her niece made these fajitas for dinner 2 nights ago and were kind enough to invite me to have some with them! They followed the recipe EXACTLY and, I must say, I would not change a thing. The level of heat was perfect for me .... the chicken was tender and flavorful and the peppers just the right amount of crunch . They reminded me of the chicken fajitas I used to get at Planet Hollywood when I visited Atlantic City, NJ. If you haven't tried this recipe...... I suggest you try it. It will become your new go to fajita recipe. Perhaps make them with shrimp instead of chicken next time!! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#I've made this recipe twice since the August issue of TOH came out. WONDERFUL. I always order Fajitas when at Mexican restaurants because I can't have rice and beans. NEVER thought I could make these at home! This recipe is a keeper. VFE 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My family loved this recipe for our chicken fajita night! Unfortunately, I didn't have any Chile powder so missed that extra heat, but still so tasty! Thought it might be a little too salty, but it was just right. I tend to be conservative with my use of spices due to my husband's preferences, but he enjoyed this too! Thanks ??
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#We LOVE this recipe! I have made it 3 times in a few months. It is flavorful and delicious! Made homemade tortillas to use with it. We only add salsa & sour cream .
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#Excellent! I made a half-recipe for the two of us and served it with cheese-and-salsa rice. DH thought it was terrific, too. Another keeper from ToH.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#This dish had the perfect blend of spices! Very flavorful, but my mouth wasn't on fire. My family loved this recipe! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#2#0#I never leave reviews because I always forget but this recipe is amazing. Followed it exactly and am very impressed with how delicious and easy this is!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#2#0#This is my 3rd time making this awesome dish! I had to look for it on the internet and found you because I remembered the recipe from before. I really enjoy these Chicken Fajitas??
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#1#Loved the marinade, only changed a few things. Used boneless skinless chicken thighs because I prefer the dark meat. Added jalapenos with the bell peppers and Yellow onion, it was pretty dang spicy but I like a lot of heat. Also I added some of the marinade from inside the bag to the pan with all the veggies and put a lid on for the first 10 minutes to effectively steam them before blackening them on high. Served the whole thing on rice with refried black beans mixed in. Note: this recipe would also be great on nachos if you dice the chicken smaller or cook it whole and shred it.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#My family enjoys this fajita recipe so much that we have it once per month. I add an extra two peppers and an extra onion.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#2#0#This is the bomb, boom boom. Real authentic, real delicious! No left overs, the plates were scraped... I will be making this my hit dish go to....Fantastically delicious!!!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#By far, the best fajita seasoning mix I have come across! Made it the first time as written, then for our taste the only thing I did different was decrease cumin to 1 tsp and a pinch and increase chili powder to 1/2 tsp and a pinch. That's it! I have used this for beef also but for beef use 1 Tbsp lemon and 1 Tbsp lime juice. Absolutely the BEST homemade fajitas!! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Made it just like the recipe, it's my favorite dinner on the quick. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#EXCELLENT - Use for company
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Excellent flavor! Will definitely make these again.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#2#0#Super simple marinade makes for tasty home made fajiatas. I cooked the chicken before the onions and peppers and left them all to warm up together and we really enjoyed our meal!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#2#0#This is the best recipe I have found for Chicken Fajitas .
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#My daughter
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#The marinade is what makes these fajitas extra special! My husband asked me to make sure and save this recipe :-)
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Great recipe! Absolutely delicious!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#2#0#I made these yesterday. I cook for one (me). Absolutely delicious. You can trust the five stars on this one. I only marinated the chicken for less than an hour, and these were still delicious. I would love to make again and marinate for the full 4 hours. I ate some with corn tortillas, but I've decided I'm going to put this over rice tomorrow for a change. YUM! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#These were delicious! My husband isn't usually a huge fan of fajitas. He still didn't eat the onions or peppers, but he ate tons of the chicken! It's a win in my book! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#3#0#Absolutely delicious. Time was limited, so we did not refrigerate the chicken in the marinade for 1-4 hours, as directed by the recipe. We still found the chicken to be abundantly flavorful! So much so, that when making it again, we will not marinate the chicken, as it was absolutely delicious and obviously required less time/planning ahead. Otherwise, there is not a thing I would suggest differently. I just wanted to point this out because often times the set in the refrigerater for x amount of hours deters one from choosing a particular recipe. So, I want to make it known that if you're looking for THE BEST CHICKEN FAJITAS but in a pinch for time, that is not a reason to pass this one up. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. This was printed off and put into our family cook book, as we will be making this often. Thank you for sharing! ? 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Made this last night on top of the stove... cooked chicken in the marinade without marinating it four hours... and it still turned out delicious.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Love these easy to make fajitas. I've made them a few times with an easy pico de gallo salsa over rice and they are awesome each timr. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Wow there was soo much flavor. I cooked the chicken and veggies on the grill, which I think added that great grilled flavor!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Doubled, had fajitas, just had the perfect meat and peppers for lunch, made enchiladas from leftovers and all were excellent.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I tripled the amount for a dinner party and only added lime zest to the marinade. It was delicious!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Yummy
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Tasty!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Made it tonight. Everyone enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Very flavorful. An easy make We really enjoyed it .
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Hi- Can I put all ingredients in crockpot to cook? Have you tried that?
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#The whole family loves this one. I have made it using lemon juice in the marinade and like juice another time when we didn't have any lemons. Great both ways.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#What do you use for seasoned salt?
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#I've made these fajitas several times and we just LOVE them. The only changes I make to this recipe are that I use lime rather than lemon juice and I use a little more red pepper flakes to add a little more heat. I always make extra (sometimes even doubling the recipe) because we really like to eat it the next morning with eggs. Sometimes, we'll mix the chicken, onions and peppers with beaten up eggs in a skillet and just scramble it all together. Sometimes, we'll just warm the chicken, onions and peppers in a skillet and then serve it with an over easy egg or two right on top. YUM!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#Excellent well rounded, full flavored recipe. Split between both chicken and flank steak. Will definitely make again. Home run.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#Extremely delicious, satisfies my cravings for restaurant Mexican food. I think marinating with the lemon juice makes a big difference.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My family loves when I make this for dinner. The flavor is really good and I usually don't have time to marinate the chicken for no longer than 30 min and it still comes out good. I'm sure if I took the time to marinate it longer the flavors would be even better but I'm fine with how it turns out.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#The more gem recipes I've located and made on Taste of Home, the less and less I've been enticed into going out to eat. I can't think of the last time I had fajitas out that could beat this recipe. There is NOTHING difficult about this recipe and the flavors are huge in this one. Sometimes, I've just used chicken tenders to save time. But the only change've ever made was to double the amount of bell peppers and chopped onions. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#1#I love your recipes. But wasn't a crazy about this on:(
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Prep time took me longer than 20 minutes but it was completely worth the time
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This was my 1st time cooking anything remotely Mexican food. I wanted to learn how to make this for a dinner date. I done a test run and it turned out delicious! I however didn't have time to marinate so I just slow cooked the chicken while letting it absorb the seasoning. I also added barbecue sauce in. I will definitely be making this again.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This is a solid marinade. I added a tablespoon of vinegar and a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for some spice and it turned out awesome. I marinated for 3 hours. It was a bit salty though, so I might bring it down to 1 teaspoon next time fyi.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#1#I used the recipe as a starting point and it turned out incredible. First I added 1 Teaspoon each of ground cayenne, ground ancho chile, and ground chipotle chile. This gave it a deeper smokie chili flavor without adding much heat. Since a added more powders I also increased the oil to make it into a nice marinade paiste. I pounded out the chicken breasts so they were equal in thickness and evenly spread the paiste over them. When cooking the chicken I started with a very hot grill and cooked them for a minute and a half on each side, removed them and let them rest of 20 minutes. This left the chicken with nice grill marks and raw in the center. I then sliced them into even stips and finished the cooking with the vegatables. By cooking the chicken twice I could control the timing of the fajitas for the party we were having.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#1#I only marinated for 30 minutes and it turned out delicious, next time will marinate longer. I did add chicken broth to pan to cook a bit longer to make sure it was well done and it came out very moist. Cooked it till broth was cooked up and then added veggies to fry up chicken.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I am not what you would call a professional cook, so making fajitas for the first time was nerve-wracking. But following this recipe and tweaking it to my liking, they were absolutely amazing! Even my mom enjoyed it, and she absolutely despises onions! They were 10x more delicious and flavourful than any fajita I've had at a Mexican restaurant, and a huge improvement compared to our local one. Personally, I used more lemon juice and a little less cummin. But since i like a little spice, I used a garlic jalapeno and even fresh jalapeno slices to give it an extra zing. Fresh cilantro chopped up really gives it an extra oomph too! I've made it twice now and both times it's came out super delicious! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Love this recipe. Very tasty!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Like others, I used 1 T lemon juice and 1T. Lime juice. Just wondeting what people used for the seasoning salt
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Excellent
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I am from South Texas and this is the best fajita marinade I have ever made. I highly recommend it as is. We did dive the chicken and then cooked it on the stovetop in the marinade.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Can I make this recipe in the oven, on a sheet pan? If so, time and temp? Thanks!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Best fajitas I've ever had, sand so easy to make! Better than at a restaurant. I plan on making these at least once a week! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This is the best chicken fajita recipe!!!! I've tried several but none are as good and simple as this. My family loves them and now I make this meal at least once a week.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My family and I loved this recipe!!! The chicken was so flavorful and we will be making this again??
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Awesome will be making again
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Was looking for something different to make when I ran across this Fajita Recipe. Sounded very good and after reading several reviews decided to try it. I used less chicken than it called for I used Yellow, Red and Green Bell Peppers and Cut the onion in larger pieces. Did not have cumin so put in cilantro 1Tbsp of Lemon and 1Tbsp lime juice. Marinated for about 2hrs. I love cooking in cast iron and I use a counter top hot place that I can adjust the temperature to precise numbers. I used 375 degrees. The flavors were absolutely wonderful. My Husband said that was the best Fajita he has ever had. Thanks for this fantastic recipe.

Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I first made this recipe about a year ago for a family gathering. It was so simple but so tasty and got rave reviews from everyone! Since then I have made it many times and use this chicken on salads as well as in tortillas.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Loved this! Easy to make and delicious. I did change a couple things, not minor. I used avocado oil, cut the Lemon juice down from 2 TBSP to 1TBSP and used 1TBSP of Lime Juice. This recipe is a keeper, and will make it again and again!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I didn't change anything. My family loves this recipe and asks for it often. Love the spices, better than packaged fajita seasoning. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I used lime juice instead of lemon, I just like it better, and I marinated whole thinly sliced chicken breasts for four hours. It was fantastic! This is my new, go to chicken fajita recipe.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#loved all the spices marinaded for about 4 hours then cooked this will be the way i make fajijas from now on thanks
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#So easy and so tasty! I only marinaded the chicken for about 20 minutes (I was in a hurry) and it was still very flavorful. This will definitely become a staple for me.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Really liked this fajita recipe!! Even the hubby liked it!!!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Family really liked these, but I'm not a fajita fan, so it only gets four stars. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I used lime juice instead of lemon juice and added cilantro on top. These are delicious and now on our general rotation. YUM. YUM YUM.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#So good and very easy to make. All I added was a couple of splashes of hot sauce.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I've made this twice and it is very flavorfully. Perfect amount of heat as is, for someone who likes spicy/hot but tongue can't handle too much. If you enjoy a good chicken fajita you should try. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#To Cynthia below who cannot eat cooked bell pepper, Maybe some chopped pimentos?? They have that peppery taste (actually in cherry pepper family) but you can try the chopped ones in a jar. Just a thought and suggestion. Have not tried this recipe yet, but plan on within next week, recipe sound great.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Made this tonight exactly as directed. It was good! I'll probably make this again. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Just made these tonight. Made exactly as instructed except I didn't have oregano, just Italian seasoning mix so I used that. They were excellent. My husband said Yum! After first nite and proceeded to inhale 3 of them. Definitely a make again and again
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I have a question. For whatever reasons, I can no longer tolerate cooked bell peppers. Raw are fine, cooked make me very sick--it's not pretty. There are so many recipes I make that are enhanced by bell peppers....anyone know of anything that makes a decent substitute and adds flavor to the recipe? Some things (like fajitas) I can keep things separated as I make them but others have to be all mixed together so cannot do. All suggestions very much appreciated. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Made exactly as written and they were some of the best fajitas I've ever made!! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#We loves inmy family. we use the seasongs for chicken tacos and nachos! Best ever!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Followed the recipe exactly and was delicious!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#These were very good and flavorful! They are easy to make and a crowd pleaser.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Love fajitas! These hit the spot!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#2#Until crisp and tender ? It's one or the other! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I have been making these for a few years now and they are ALWAYS a great meal. You really don't need to change anything with this recipe, just follow it and enjoy. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I have tried so many different fajita recipes and it seemed nothing was ever good enough. This is the best recipe for fajitas so far and ive been looking a long time. I didn't follow the directions exactly though. I used chicken I had precooked, dumped it into marinade for about 10 min tops while I sliced veggies. Then I put the chicken in a hot skillet with all the marinade. Let it heat a min before tossing in all the peppers and onion. Then I cooked it all til my preferred doneness of veggies. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Am try to make it
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I have made this dish twice a week and hubby loves it more than i do. It isgoing to be a stable dish in myhouse now. And i am never ever ordering fajita in resturants anymore. It is so easy, convinent and delicious dish. Thank you for the receipe.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I made this recipe hundreds of times starting back in 2000 when it first appeared in the magazine AND I was a newlywed. My 13-year-old likes it and my 8-year-old just started to like it. I just leave out the crushed red pepper flakes and I use red onion. This recipe is in regular rotation in this house.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Successful weekday dinner!!! Super delicious and easy to make. I would know... I am not the best cook lol.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I was skeptical of this recipe but it was so flavorful and delicious! A hit with even my picky 5 year old! I will for sure be making this again!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#2#I made this and added shredded cabbage to the sauteed peppers and onions. I did add extra onions and peppers. I also added slightly more crushed red peppers. We absolutely loved this recipe. There is something about the lemon flavor that we liked. The hub went for seconds and said you can make a lot.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#When your three year old son who only eats chicken nuggets says this chicken is yummy mommy you know you have a winner. This is a real delicious dish. I make it often now because it's also so simple. Great quick weekday meal.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#So tasty.i love this recipe.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#So tasty. Even my wife, who doesn't get excited about fajitas, thought they were good. I felt they could have used a lot more peppers and onions though. Next time I'll probably use twice as much. I also salted the peppers and onions while they sauteed. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#SO tasty, quick and easy! I let the chicken sit in the seasoning while I cut the veggies. I omitted the green onions and since I love veggies used lots of peppers (2 red, 2 orange, 1 yellow, 1/2 a lg poblano and a lg yellow onion). I lightly salted the veggies as they cooked with some garlic powder. The chicken was so tender and everything was flavorful-YUM!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#These are especially good. My husband doesn't normally like leftovers but he asked me if we had enough left for another meal. The only thing I did differently was to add yellow & orange sliced peppers to the red and green. Very good meal. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This made delicious fajitas loaded with flavor but still somehow pleasantly mild. They were especially good with the sour cream. My family loved this recipe - definitely a keeper!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This is AMAZINGLY GOOD!!! Delicious! I am the only female, I doubled the recipe for the four men in the house. I hardly had any left!!! Great recipe!!!! Definitely a keeper!!!!!! &lt;3
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This was delicious the fist time so I had to do it again.Thank you
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#DELICIOUS!!!! I only put my chicken in the marinade for an hour but still tasted amazing. Also I didn't have lemons so I used lime juice instead and nonetheless fajitas were amazing. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#These fajitas were delicious. I loved how the marinade formed a coating on the chicken. Also, it was a beautiful day outside so I left the chicken whole when marinating. Then, grilled it. I will definitely make these again!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#So tasty!!! This will be an often used recipe at our house.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Wow, this really is a 5 star recipe. I made these into fajita bowls with cauliflower rice and it was really phenomenal. The chicken was so tender and the onions and peppers were delish. Definitely reccommend!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This was soooooo good! Surprisingly, my hubs, who doesn't care for fajitas, had 3!!!! He said these were the best he's had! My son loved them too. Thanks for sharing! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This is delicious! I also made it with shrimp and it was also very good.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I love chicken fajitas and this is definitely a keeper. My Mom who is 92 loves it. I marinate the chicken overnight and I wouldn't change a thing. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This was given a thumbs up by the whole family. Easy and delicious!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#1#These were really good. I had a few options for everyone. They chose a tortilla, tortilla chips or rice to spoon this mixture over. Great either way!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#These were great! I doubled the recipe and good thing, too. I made three changes: halved the cumin, cooked the chicken along with the marinade (would have been impossible to separate anyway), and added extra salt. I did include the crushed reds, as recommended. We didn't even eat them on tortillas (saving carbs) and they were still great!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Had this tonight and the chicken was so tender and flavorful! Hubby and son loved this saying it's restaurant quality! A repeater for sure 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Fantastic!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This is a fab recipe! I make the seasoning in large quantity and use 2 tabs of it every time I make it, that way it saves a lot of time.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#1#Very Good Mexican Flavored Fajitas... Hubby, Son & Grandbaby LOVED them.. Next time I'll add Black Beans per hubby's request... I did Saute Chicken in a Tab. Spoon of Butter & used Veg. Oil for marinade as well... Will Defiantly be making again 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This will be my third time making this dish via this recipe, it is simple and delicious! Took me about 15 mins to find this recipe after sifting through a bunch of different site recommendations, but only this one would do. I added 2 large garlic cloves and substituted peanut oil for canola, but only on my third attempt, and as it is still marinating, I can only highly suggest the recipe to a T, but that isn't a bad thing; this recipe is delicious on it's own! (Approved by my fiance and two children (8&10yrs old) 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Best fajita recipe ever! My husband, who doesn't like too many vegetables in his dinner, gobbled these up. I usually double the recipe; it reheats just fine. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This is the best fajita recipe I've found yet. I prefer to sub lime juice in place of lemon juice, and I let the chicken marinate for a couple of hours. Also, I dump the chicken plus marinade into the skillet, without discarding the sauce. I love the inclusion of green onions in this recipe. I usually serve it with homemade guacamole. Everyone wants seconds! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I made these last night and they were really good! I chopped my chicken into chunks instead of strips so they are easier to eat. I will make them again soon! I made enough for leftovers for salads this week!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Excellent! Quick and easy to make!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Easy and Delicious!!! I can fix side dishes while this is baking. Awesome!!!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Very good! Not salty and very good flavor. Everybody loved it. I put everything into the electric skillet and marinaded the chicken over night.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I just cooked this recipe to a tee for my Cuban family and everybody loved it. I doubled the portions of everything to make more for a big group of people and made a cilantro salsa to top it off with that just put the final touch on this restaurant quality recipe! The only thing different was I let the chicken marinate overnight which was a good choice because the flavors infused into the chicken and I splashed lemon juice all over the final product to get it extra zest plus it just looks cool and like I know what I'm doing. I don't. I'm just good at following directions :) Absolutely delicious! This is now my go to fajita recipe!! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#1#Super tasty! I made a couple tweaks as I don't have a grill. Baked the chicken at 450 in the oven for 17 minutes (keeps the chicken juicy inside but cripsy out so you can kind of get that grill feeling). Also served with homemade guac. See my full version here: https://goo.gl/4rfasy 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My husband and I really enjoyed these. I just usedthe regular onions and omitted the green onions.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My favorite chicken fajita recipe. Had this last night and for lunch today. Love it and so does my husband!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I have made this recipe a few times now and it is definitely flavorful! I make it exactly to the recipe and always refrigerate it overnight. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you! ??
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This recipe is awesome as is! My husband recommended broiling the chicken in our toaster oven to keep the meat tender, 10 minutes per side , and while cooking the vegetables in the pan. It came together very quickly and turned out great!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This was so delicious and simple. We like things spicy so I also sprinkled in some hot sauce and as I was saut?ing the meat I also sprinkled a few drops of liquid smoke. Yummy!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I made this for dinner tonight for company and it was a hit. It goes really well with rice and refried beans. Super easy. I also used olive oil instead of what the recipe initially called for. I will be keeping this recipe for sure.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I love fajitas and this recipe did not fail me. Delicious blend of spices! My husband prefers shrimp so for his I used the same seasonings and just added frozen shrimp instead of chicken. He said they were great!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Delish! The whole family raved, and the best part is it is such an easy meal to prepare. I had a cooled roasted chicken I needed to use, so I cut the breasts into thin slices. One family member cannot have seasoned salt so I used garlic salt instead and eliminated the garlic powder. I tossed the chicken with the marinade and let it sit for just a couple minutes while I sliced the peppers and onions. I saut?ed the peppers and onions in one pan and heated the chicken in another since some family members don't prefer the peppers. Such a winner meal! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I love this recipe. I use frozen peppers and onions which makes it quick. I also let them defrost and drain them so the dish is not watery. I consider this a quick meal. And so good.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#We don't eat much mexican food, but I tried this recipe. It was quite good. I used olive oil instead of the oil listed and eliminated the cumin, chile powder and red pepper flakes. I would make this again. Thanks. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My husband and I LOVE this recipe! Better than fajitas from a Mexican restaurant.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Delicious!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Excellent recipe!! Made as is except for using a bag of frozen bell peppers and onions. Definite keeper!!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This was very delicious. I used organic chicken breast tenderloins.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This is the absolute best fajita I ever ate!!! I like more veggies, so I'll add another pepper and some julienned onion the next time. However, it was totally wonderful just as written. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Saving this one!!! Although I only used the marinade, this is a keeper. I had roasted a whole chicken to use during the week. I wanted to do some chicken tacos and wanted a superior flavoring for the meat. I found this and it was perfect for what I wanted.. I mixed it up and let my chicken rest in this marinade for a bit and tossed it into the skillet to heat it up. It came out soooo goooood. I will be keeping this for sure! Thank you for sharing!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Quick and easy dinner. My family always loves chicken fajitas, and this recipe doesn't disappoint! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Easy weeknight dinner!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Easy to prep, make, cook and oh so tasty.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Delicious and flavorful! I doubled the seasoning and used one whole each of red, yellow, and green bell pepper and one whole onion sliced (not too thin) just like they do at my favorite Mexican restaurant. I made Spanish rice to go with our meal. Definitely a keeper!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#The whole family loved it
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#great meal
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Quick and easy. I've made this recipe three times now. My family loves it. Definitely a recipe I will be using over and over. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Excellent! Made homemade tortillas. Makes it even better.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Delicious..Delicious..Delicious
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Made today but I didn't have the seasoned salt. Still came out amazing. Family loved it! It is definitely a keeper and a recipe worth repeating several times per year. I actually turned on the broiler at the end, made up the fajitas by placing two tortillas on a sheet of aluminum foil and preparing two large fajitas to go under the broiler, just until the cheese starts bubbling. They added salsa and sour cream and wrapped them up. Sauteing the vegetables in the remaining liquid left from cooking chicken is important. Cooked until they appear burnt in spots. Incredible! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This came out great but I reduced the c umin 1/4 teaspoon and the same with the chili powder and added a little extra garlic and added onion powder 1 teaspoon. Other than that, the longer it's marinated the better. I marinated it for 4 hours and used burrito tortillas. Also added rice. Really delicious, 4 people each had 2 with the fixings. Everyone was satisfied.

Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Fantastically delisious!! So very flavorful without the crazy spice. Will be making many times over! Thank you.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Awesome GOOD!!!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#We just finish dinner and I got nice complements about this fajitas. I did it exactly as you say and they were amazing. IServed some tortillas but also some Boston lettuce leaves for those who I knew were going to have more than one.Definitely I will make them ofte.Thanks so much.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Outstanding! Followed recipe exactly except used a pre-chopped fajita veggie mix from the produce aisle. Could not have been quicker or easier! Thanks!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This is an amazing fajita recipe! We had them last night & my whole family LOVED them! I made the recipe exact (including red pepper flakes) except I did allow the chicken to marinate over night. My family used to love the Applebee's sizzling fajita skillet & they took it off the menu...I tried a couple copy cat recipes & none were that close. THIS is almost exactly like it & my son asked how I got the recipe from them! I will be making this very often & am so glad this popped up in Pinterest for me! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I'm a Volunteer Filed Editor and I love testing out recipes. The marinade in this recipe was just right! We really enjoyed the flavours in this dish. I cut everything up and let it sit while I got the kids from school. It was nice to have the prep work done ahead of time as this allowed me to help the kids with homework right up till it was time to cook supper! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Hands down this is a great chicken fajita recipe. I've tasted them before but never made them. This is the first time I ever made chicken fajitas.....lets just say that this recipe is definitely being added to my recipe book. The marinade is divine and packs a lot of flavor. I didnt let it sit for 24 hours. It was late so i let it sit for an hour and a half tops. That was all the time i needed. It was delicious. The marinade was so good that i could have eaten the chicken by itself. I'll will for sure be using this marinade for other recipes as well. My husband and son loved it. Cant wait to share this with my sisters at service. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Thank you for a delicious and wonderful recipe. I followed the recipe to a tee , but I allowed my chicken to marinate overnight, I highly recommend doing so! The chicken was moist and the flavors were 10 times better then any fajita packet from the grocery store! My 2 yr old gobbled the chicken down and kept asking for more! This will be in our weekly rotation!! Please try this recipe and you won't be disappointed!! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#I made this without letting the chicken marinate because I was in a hurry and it was awesome. I'm sure it would be even better if it had time to marinate for a while. I usually use store bought fajita seasoning but didn't have any so used this recipe. The combination of seasonings was perfect and much better than what I have used from the store. This recipe is a keeper. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#First time making this dish without measuring, just put it all together and it is AWESOME! I WILL BE MAKING THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN! Easy to making, not time consuming!! I love it!!!! I give it 10 Stars!!!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#I have now made these twice and they are the best fajitas I have EVER made!!!! But as some have commented, much better after marinating for at least 24 hours! The longer, the more flavorful!!!! Better than most restaurants!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#Fantastic! Will certainly make again and again......
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#Best fajita seasoning EVER! I always increase the veggies, usually 3-4 bell peppers and 2 onions.I never get fajitas at restaurants now because they're always so disappointing. Nothing is as flavorful as this recipe. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Like a dumb ass, I've been using a store bought seasoning package when I came across this recipe n discovered that I have all these ingediants at home! It is spectacular! My picky kids ate ever morsal. Defanetly going to make this a regular dish. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I so agree with all the 5 star ratings for this recipe. It is truly wonderful. The chicken is perfectly seasoned. Do not hesitate to try this recipe. I will be making this one alot more often.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Absolutely outstanding! These fajitas are better than the ones at my favorite Mexican restaurant. I made the following modifications: tripled the bell pepper/onion and added a coarsely-chopped tomato during the last few minutes of cooking the chicken. I also used heaping measuring spoons of all the spices. Served with sour cream and guacamole salad, there were no leftovers!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I made this last night and it was excellent! The hubby said it was better than any restaurant. I made it as written except used olive oil, lemon and lime juice, and no red pepper flakes (should've used them... needed a little kick). I charred up the peppers and onions in the broiler. Served with shredded mixed Mexican cheeses and sour cream. Delish! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I made this last night and will def make it again. I followed the recipe but added a little bit of cream cheese to the chicken once I put it back in the skillet and WOW! Definitely a winner recipe! Thanks for sharing! : )
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I didn't use lemon or lime juice and side have seasoned salt. I used Adobo instead. Marinated my chicken tenderloins for about 2 hours in the fridge. Used 1 1/2 yellow & red peppers and 1 1/2 onions. Sauteed low and slow for about 45 min. Served with sour cream avocado, shredded cheese and refried beans. Delish! Super easy and a fast meal. A yummy recipe. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#These are great....we love them. We used chicken once and then skirt steak the next time.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#1#I haven't made this yet, but plan on it. Does anyone know if I use olive oil if it will make a difference? 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Amazing fajita recipe. I've never made them before and everyone raved. The chicken comes so moist and tender...better than the restaurants. The only change I made was, I marinaded the chicken all day (because I was at work) and not the recommended 1-4 hours the recipe suggested. Definitely a keeper!! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This recipe was one of the Top 10 of 2015, and I heartily agree! I have made it several times and it never fails. (My only substitution was lime juice for the lemon.) Wonderful addition to my TexMex repertoire!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This was really good! Add some chopped coriander on top to garnish!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Wow! These fajitas got it going on. Easy to make. Flavor is spot on. I did use lime juice instead of lemon. These made it in my receipe rotation for sure!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This will be my new go to for fajitas. I used to make a seasoning that had corn starch in it and it much prefer this one. I made as is, but like someone else's post about lime juice as opposed to lemon juice. I'll give that a try next time. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Hadn't made fajitas before. These were very good. I thought it was a lot seasoning at first for the chicken, but blended well together. I did add tomatoes with jalape?os to the veggies for more flavor and my husband and I like things with a little heat. I did not put taco sauce on the fajita as I thought it would overpower the flavors. Will definitely make these again! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This was wonderful! Both my husband and I loved this fajita seasoning. The only change I made to the seasoning was to use lime juice instead of lemon juice. As far as the rest goes - make other or more vegetables as desired! We often make fajitas, so, we already know we like to cook one full onion and one each of the following bell peppers: red, green and yellow.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#We love to cook & can be selective about spices....this combination was excellent. Per our preference, we used boneless/skinless chicken thighs. We warmed our flour tortillas on a cast iron pan until right before they toast too much to fold (adds another layer of yummy flavor). Good enough to make for company, goes together FAST. My only change will be to double the veggies & onion.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I have made this since it first appeared in 2000 and it is a keeper. All family loves it, even the most picky grandkids. Occasionally substitute lime juice for lemon just for a change, but for the most part follow recipe exactly as written except for adding more veggies, as one grandson can't get enough peppers and onions. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#We all loved this recipe. I used lime juice instead of lemon juice. I have also used skirt steak instead of chicken. I prefer the chicken but hubs liked the steak better. Both were very good. It's so delicious and easy that I've made it for friends many times. One of our favorites. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I have this almost memorized because I make this all the time. The first time I made it, my boyfriend remarked , if I ordered this at a restaurant, I would be back the very next night . I have made this at least 30 times and it is always fantastic. This recipe is simple enough to be quick and easy and yet involves enough flavor to make you feel like you are simply amazing in the kitchen. I typically double the marinade. While the chicken is marinating, I chop vegetables. I have been adding mushrooms lately and it's a great addition. I cook the veggies first, be sure to add salt and pepper. Then I cook chicken after marinating for at least 1 hour. Mix it all together and voila. I love to cook all the time, but this recipe has to be made regularly. It's just that good! And don't skip the red pepper. Cleanup is also easy, it only requires a cutting board and a pan! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Tried this a few weeks ago and my family is asking me to make it again. This recipe is super easy and very tasty. It will be in our meal rotation often.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Quick and incredible!!!! Awesome to have on hand! Will make over and over!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#1#I marinated the chicken a full day and it seemed to be missing something. We happen to like a little more spice. I agree with other reviewers that it might be better with lime, but I didn't have any. . I probably won't use this recipe again. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My husband just asked that I cook more peppers and onions next time. My teen boys and their friend ate it and loved it also, amazing! They loved the slight spice that was just the right level for them.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#We did enjoy the fajitas, but I like it better with lime as opposed to lemon and I add a sauce for a little extra zip.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This is a fantastic recipe! It's super easy and the result is delicious. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Disappointing. All you could taste was citrus! :( Not sure what I am going to do with the leftover chicken now as it wasn't enjoyed. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Very good and easy to make. I followed the directions except I used a frozen bag of peppers and onions so I didn't have the prep time. These were great the next day too. Lots of flavor! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I tried this and the fajitas were delicious
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I love anything fajita! This was enjoyed by all!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I thought I would try this for a quick and easy dinner and I am glad I did. It was really flavorful. I did squeeze a little lime juice on the finished fajita. It just added a little extra zip.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Make sure you cut the chicken into thin strips to cook quicker and make making wraps easier. We did not use any spice that had heat in it. For 2 people, it produces at least 2 different meals. We put in a cut up tomato towards the end and it added great flavor.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This recipe is easy and my Family loves it!It has become a favourite on the Family menu! :)
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Love this receive. EZ!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My family loves these
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Delicious, my family love it!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This is my 1st time submitting a review for an online recipe, although I use them often. This time I was compelled to create a user ID so I could share how well these turned out. I typically find online recipes too bland for my family, this one was an exception, although I did add a half tsp more of every spice in the recipe and more citrus and cilantro. This is a very authentic (at least NA authentic) dish. Tip: marinate the chicken for as long as possible
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This is really amazing. Like made am account just to say this is good, amazing. Additionally simple, cheap, and easy to modify.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Delicious and quick if you prepare ingredients ahead of time. Husband says excellent taste of Mexican.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I made this for dinner for my mother and me. I ate it without the cheese or tortilla. It was delicious. I marinated the onions and peppers separately. I am not sure I needed to do that, but I like the added flavor. I also used coconut cream for sour cream.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I didn't have lemon juice so I used cut up pineapple pieces and squeezed them in the bag, threw them out before cooking because I didn't want a too tropical flavor, but next time might just cook it that way. Didn't taste the pineapple at all. I used 4 small breasts. Was delicious and one of my best meals ever. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I added 1.5 lbs top sirloin steak and doubled this recipe and it was amazing! The marinade is what makes this recipe so delicious, flavorful, and juicy! Such a great recipe.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This recipe may have just changed my life. I'm going to make this time and time again. Something so easy to make should not taste this amazing. The chicken has so much flavor. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Fabulous recipe! Wished I could give it 20 stars! Who needs packet fajita mix, if you can make this. This is a keeper in my recipe book.Julie, THANK YOU so much for sharing it with us all.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Wonderful flavor. Only put in a pinch of pepper flakes because of little ones
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My family and I really enjoyed this fajita recipe! Delicious! I didn't add the pepper flakes because my 3 year old wouldn't eat it like that. We also added black beans, lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, salsa and cheese to our fajitas. :) 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Very good recipe. I cut the chicken in strips after it's cooked. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Fabulous!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Absolutely Delicious! I made this for myself, my hubby and our 7 year old daughter and it was a hit! I doubled the chicken and marinade and used whole green, red and yellow bell peppers. A quick, simple and great meal!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This was absolutely delicious! I used lime juice instead of lemon juice. I marinated for 2 hrs and the chicken was really tender when I threw it in the pan. I know this should be common sense, but be sure to mix the marinade up in the baggy before adding the chicken so it distributes evenly. If you use hot Mexican chili powder use far less than the recipe states! Super spicy. I added mango slices to the pan toward the end of cooking time and added avocado and tomato on top of my tortilla. Mmmmm mango.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I made this for my picky nieces and they both loved it. Everyone else did too and it was so easy to make.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I will be making these all the time now. Delicious!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My son with minimal cooking experience took the initiative to make supper one night. Lucky for us he found this recipe. Fantastic! Better than any fajitas I have ever had. Because he enjoys peppers, he used a whole pepper (red & green) rather than just half as suggested. I'm am surprising him tomro, just finished prep work and marinating in basement fridge. Only need fresh guacamole and a little cilantro and we're set! Very happy Daddy! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Amazing, better than any fajitas at a restaurant!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Made this for dinner, terrific just as the recipe is listed. I added some mushrooms. Outstanding
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#i love this recipe! i've been cooking fajitas using this recipe for a while now. The only thing i changed is using lime juice instead of lemon. It's also easier to add the dry seasonings to the bag before adding the juice and oil. It's less messy. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Delicious sounding, I cannot wait to make these.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Everyone loved this recipe. I think I could have used just 1 TBSP of oil to fry the onions and peppers in though. Thanks for sharing!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#These fajitas are delicious. Everyone at our fiesta loved them. Best fajita recipe out there
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Hello I did this for dinner tonight it's was delicious 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This was my first time making fajitas in a skillet since I'm so used to barbecuing everything on a grill outside, but alas winter has started so I needed to find a good recipe after wasting my time and food trying other ones. I found this recipe and decided to give it a shot. Everyone loved it including my 5 and 7 year old! Their's didn't have any peppers though ;P I did use lime juice instead of lemon because of what I read on the comments section and it was awesome. Also I added a jalapeno to give it a little more kick for my hubby. The only thing I would do different would be to only use half the serving amount of oregano lol but that is just a preference. This recipe will be used again and again in my home :) 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#These were really very good and so easy! The only change I made was to add Emeril's Southwest Seasoning to taste to the veggies when saut?ing. Will make again. The combination of seasonings in the marinade tasted like fajitas without a prepackaged mix. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Great basic recipe that is easily adaptable to one's specific tastes. Be warned not to marinate too long with this recipe, though. The citric acid will eventually cook the chicken (in fact, this is how ceviche is made). As for freezing the chicken--yes, it can be easier to cut partially frozen chicken. However, if you are having a hard time cutting unfrozen chicken, the culprit is most likely a dull knife. Of course, many of us freeze chicken, but keep in mind that the process of freezing any meat will degrade the meat at least somewhat. Given a choice, I would always choose never been frozen chicken, and I certainly wouldn't freeze it just to make cutting it easier. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I just made these for my family. HUGE hit! We even have one picky little eater in this family. I doubled the veggies because the ratio between veggies and chicken tasted off . Making again tomorrow.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I have made these before and they are a hit every time. It's a great idea for entertaining friend too. It's fun to have everyone create their own frajitas from a assortment of toppings. Don't forget the margaritas!! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My husband and I love these fajitas. The only changes I make are to double the onion and pepper because I thought it needed more vegetables. The spice mixture is good, but I'm going to try doubling it for the same amount of chicken today and see if it gives it a little more flavor. Quick, easy and delicious, especially with salsa and sour cream! You won't be disappointed! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#It's easier to slice uncooked boneless chicken breasts if they're partially frozen. If fresh, place in the freezer for about 45 minutes before slicing. The lime juice was an excellent idea. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Delicious!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Love them!!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Very flavorful! We enjoyed our dinner .
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Very tasty! Lots of flavor and I only marinated about an hour.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#These have a perfect spice blend. I never think ahead enough to marinate things. So I just cut partially thawed chicken breasts and let them sit in the sauce mix just for as long as it took me to chop the vegetables. Worked great! I also agree that lime instead of lemon juice is a wonderful swap. My husband loved these!

Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Haven't tried yet 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Hey. This is the best I've had. My wife adores them and my kids love them.I switched to Lime juice instead of lemon juice before even starting it. The lime is far more aromatic when cooking with a better flavor as well. Great recipe, the chili powder and lime makes it! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#We love these and have them often - I changed to lemon juice to lime juice and I like it even better...
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Sooooo good!!! I made homemade Spanish rice to add into the fajitas and it was great. Will make again
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Better than any restaurant fajita I have ever had!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This was my first time making this and it was so good. The whole family loved it. It's been added to my recipe box. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#So flavorful, never any leftovers
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This recipe is my first attempt at fajitas and it was huge success! As stated in ALL the other reviews, they are as good and maybe better than restaurant fajitas. My only advice is maybe err on the side of too narrow strips of chicken. I thought I was getting them thin, but not so. They were still yummy, just not traditional thin strips. Also, may try in a cast iron skillet next time, just because!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Hands down the best fajitas i've ever had. This recipe is a keeper! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I thought this recipe was awesome (as did everyone else). I did sub blood orange olive oil for canola, lime juice for lemon, and I grilled whole boneless chicken breasts vs pan frying. I also made shrimp, which I did saute. I marinated for four to six hours. Seriously the best tasting fajitas I've ever made, maybe the best I've ever had. I didn't try the shrimp, but heard it was delicious, also. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Family favorite.

Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Easy recipe and the chicken had good flavor!

Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Not sure quite traditional but excellent! We'll be making this frequently! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Very good. I marinated the meat for four hours and so and it turned out to be salty enough that it left no room for taco seasoning. But we added some anyway, so it was a little too salty. Next time I will add less cumin, because 1 and 1/2 tsps was a little too strong.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Outstanding.......as good or better than any restaurant fajitas. Easy to prepare...
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#very flavorfull
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This is yummy! We had it just as a stir fry with some salsa added in, the salsa added an element of flavour. Will make it again with guacamole and salsa. Thanks for sharing!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I loved these delicious fajitas. Used 1 lb. of chicken, kept everything else the same.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Doubled the marinade and upped the citrus by doing a lemon and a lime. Amazing taste and the family loved it!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This was my first time making fajitas. We (+children) loved the flavor....not too spicy. The chicken was tender and topped with sour cream. I will make this again!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Great marinade, I wonder how it would work to make a bunch of marinade and cut and freeze the chicken for ready to go freezer meals. Yum.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#These were so good and so easy to make. Was supposed to feed 6, but 3 of us devoured these with no leftovers!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My family likes these fajitas for supper but love the leftovers for breakfast the next day. I make extra filling to mix into scrambled eggs for breakfast.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Loved this! This will be my go-to fajita recipe from now on!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Really tasty recipe, I had all of the ingredients on hand. I will be making this one again :o)
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#ABSOLUTE DELISH!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This marinade recipe is very good. I've made it several times. I've even used this recipe on steak for steak fajitas. It tastes really good for both chicken and steak fajitas. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This recipe is one of the best I have ever made for marinating the chicken for the fajitas. Fantastic recipe! Try it..you won't be disappointed. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Delicious and soooo easy to prepare! Loved the combination of spices.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#PS I used fresh squeezed lime juice instead of lemon juice too.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This is a keeper! I've been searching for the taste of restaurant chicken fajitas and have finally found it. Thank you! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I made this with lime juice instead of lemon juice. I used some of those mini, multi colored bell peppers. This was so good! This is definitely a keeper! Thank you for sharing this recipe.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Best fajitas I have had to date!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#IT WAS SO GOOD, MY HUSBAND LOVE IT, TOO.MRS. SANDRA ELENA SMITH
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I added black beans to the party and it was excellent. I just used one large chicken breast and it lasted 3 days of constant yummy fajitas. I also used some green onion and fresh cilantro through the cooking process. This is a good foundation for a yummy Mexican fajita.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I had always wanted to make fajitas on my own...when finding this recipe I couldn't wait to try it. It will now become one of our favorite mexican recipes. The flavor is delicious, and chicken is so moist when marinating with this combo of spices, I LOVED the lemon in it..Hubby said they were the best he had ever eaten. I did not use the red pepper flakes nor the green onion...it was perfect and I will make this again and again. This recipe is a keeper! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I have been making this recipe for years, I make up the seasoning mix ahead of time and keep it in a sealed container. I also use lime juice instead of the lemon, gives it a great authentic flavor. This is a recipe I use in our once a month cooking menu.!!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I thought it was delicious. My husband asked for the recipe so he can make it at the fire station. The only thing I changed was using lime juice instead of lemon juice because that is what I had on hand. Excellent recipe.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Made the recipe exactly as written but also added beef strips. My family loved these fajitas and said they were the best I had ever made......a keeper!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I love this recipe. I make it at least 2 times a month-- it is quick and easy and we all love it.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I added some rice and avacado to my fajita it was delicious.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My family and i love the chicken fajitas.that was the first time i made them,my 3year old even said good.it was the first my 66 year old grandma even ate a fajita, i told her i was going to make it like toro loco and she said she never even ate their so i was very pleased when she injoyed her meal i also made spanish rice and homeade refried beans. I will make it again it just might become a regular dish.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My entire family loved this recipe. We all love peppers and chose to add 3 or 4 peppers, rather than the 1 pepper that is recommended. We also prepared the peppers by roasting them in the oven first and then peeling them. Then added them to the onion mixture. We also grilled the chicken so we did not cut the chicken into strips until after it was cooked.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This is the best chicken fajita recipe that I've tried. I sub 1 teaspoon salt for the seasoned salt and I use olive oil instead of canola oil. Everyone that has tried these raves about them. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This is a old recipe I got from taste of home years ago and have been making it ever since. I moved and misplaced my recipe and found it a few months later and was so happy. If you try it you will love it. do not change anything. it is perfect exactly how it is.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This was very good will put it in the keep file
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I love this recipe. I marinated the chicken overnight though and it had a terrific kick to it. I also added lettuce to the add on choices. Thank you so much for sharing this.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Our family liked this recipe. Even my daughters that don't like peppers. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Fantastic flavor! You don't even need tortillas, just eating it plain is absolutely delicious! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Wonderful, quick recipe. This one's going into the tried and true file ;-) 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#1#I make these all the time but made a few changes from the first time I made them. I felt they were a little bland so I revamped the seasoning to 2 tsp of cumin and 2 tsp of garlic powder and replaced the green onions with sliced red onions and 2 peppers the color of the peppers depends on what I have on hand.Try yellow and orange peppers too. If you want to get rid of the after eating peppers burps try this: After slicing your peppers in strips soak in water for a few minutes and then drying your peppers with a paper towel. Then cooking. I can almost guarantee you won't be burping peppers all night. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I have tried many fajita recipes and I was always disappointed. Until now. This one was great. Only change I would make is to cut back on the salt.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I make these ALL THE TIME! Thanks to this recipe, my 2 toddlers are eating peppers and loving them. I like to make a huge batch of the seasoning up at one time to have on hand. This recipe also works perfectly if you want to make a freezer meal kit... just slice the chicken and put in a freezer bag - you could even make up the seasoning marinade and pour into the bag before freezing. Then slice up the peppers and onions and put in a separate bag. When it comes time to cook, just defrost the chicken in the fridge... the peppers and onions can be cooked right from the freezer. One of my top recipes from Taste of Home ever, love love love this.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My family loved it. I will definitely make this again.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I really like this recipe. I admit that I used to use packaged seasoning mixes because I couldn't find a recipe I liked the seasonings in but this was awesome. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Delicious!! We loved the leftover chicken in salads the next day. Excellent seasoning combination...all ingredients I had on hand. Thanks for the recipe:)
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This chicken fajitas recipe is one my family has enjoyed for many years! The is also good on a salad.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This is an excellent recipe! I did modify it a little. I cut up chicken breasts into strips and placed them in a crockpot. I then added the rest of the ingredients except for the peppers and onions. I cooked it on low all day. I also sauted the peppers and onions and then placed them in the crockpot about an hour before eating. Needless to say, there wasn't much left over. Thanks for a wonderful recipe. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#YUM!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My husband and I think this is as good as the Mexican restaurants in our area if not better.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I could not believe how good this was and it's SO easy! I had all the spices in my pantry for the marinade and always have lemons on hand. This is definitely a keeper. I'll even make this for company sometime, too! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Awesome recipe! Better then Mexican restaurant chicken Fajitas.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Loved this recipe! The only thing I did differently was double the marinade mix. Meat was tender and so flavorful!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Great recipe! Definitely a keeper!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My husband and I love this recipe. I use more peppers, ( red, yellow and orange) and onions. The last time I made these my husband said that this is his favorite meal that I make. He said he would love to have them once a week. I usually serve Spanish rice or refried beans with them. Great recipe, Julie.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe. It's so easy to make, and even if I forget to marinate the chicken the night before, it's unbelievably flavorful in just an hour two. Wonderful! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This was so good! The flavor was perfect. I didn't have fresh peppers and onions, so I used a frozen blend and they ended up pretty limp, so I will use fresh next time, but it still tasted great. Super quick and easy, too. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This is one of my family's favorite dishes! They taste great! 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Excellent flavor. I've made this many times. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My husbands and I favorite dish. This is definitely a keeper to pass down to my children.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Instead of using chicken for this recipe, I used a Butterball Apple Wood Smoked Turkey. Since it was fully cooked, I kept the sauted peppers (red & yellow) and onions in the pan and added the turkey to heat it up. This was sooooo yummy!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#My husband says this recipe is better than any he has eaten. I have made it time and time again! Best Flavor!!!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#Very good, but I decreased the amount of seasoned salt to 1/2 tsp (the 2nd time I made them) and the recipe turned out A LOT better!!!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#1#I was really excited when I saw this recipe because the seasonings made it look like it would be perfect (seasonings were very similar to Lawry's fajita mix which I think is very good). Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. If I were to make it again, which I will not be doing, I would definitely add more green & red peppers. Probably a total of 3 peppers in all for the 1 1/2 pounds of chicken. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#I just add a little crushed red pepper flakes, one red and one green pepper. We love it
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#awesome
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#very good. I didnt add the red pepper flakes cause I dont have'em but it was still delicious. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This recipe was great but spicey. I will make this a lot but without the red pepper flakes. Even my kids loved this!
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#We love this recipe! The chicken also freezes very well. Just combine oil, seasonings, and chicken per the recipe, and freeze in the resealable bags. It finishes marinating as it thaws, and makes a wonderfully quick dinner.
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#1#0#I made this last night for dinner and everyone really liked it. I liked that it was so easy. I didn't have lemon juice so I used lime instead. I will make this again for sure. 
Flavorful Chicken Fajitas#0#0#This recipe is a favorite in my eighth grade Family and Consumer Education classroom. We marinate the chicken over night to reduce prep time on foods lab day.
Apple Pie#5#1#I enjoy all of your recipes I will try this one.
Apple Pie#7#8#I loved this recipe! I say loved because something got changed. Can someone help me out? It was SO thick this time I made it, and I hate ginger, so there definitely was none in there before whatever changes got put into this recipe anybody have the original recipe from before? Cuz it was the best apple pie I'd ever had!
Apple Pie#7#5#This Apple pie is amazing. I added other ingredients to it like coconut and it was so nice.
Apple Pie#31#12#This is a very good basic apple pie recipe. As with any recipe, tweaking may be needed to suit your personal tastes, and reading the directions carefully is also mandatory. When reading reviews, I noticed several folks complaining about their pie being under-done, then saw one lady who said she had to add time to the initial 25 minutes, when the recipe specifically calls for an additional 20-25 mins, after foil is removed. I suspect more than one person undercooked their pie by not reading the recipe correctly.
Apple Pie#6#2#Love this recipe always turns out delicious my husband love apple pie thank you
Apple Pie#15#6#This recipe by far is out of this world! My first time making apple pie! ?? I made it last night and it turned out So delicious ! We love love love it!!! I did used variety apples as indicated from the helpful tips! I added a little little more dough than requested by increasing by 1/2 more since I love thick crust, and for filling i have added 1 teaspoon of allspice to give a unique taste. Baking time took longer for the extra thick crust by 8-10 min. Thanks for sharing this recipe and the great tips- very helpful!
Apple Pie#15#7#Really good pie filling recipe! My first time making an apple pie. I only had Honeycrisp and Golden Delicious apples so I used those. Came out great! I did cheat and use Pillisbury refridgerated pie crusts. I made it on Wednesday night and didn't cut/server it until Thursday (Thanksgiving Day). It was perfect! 
Apple Pie#3#1#perfection
Apple Pie#17#12#I had lots of apples left from a recent visit to a friend's orchard so I decided to make a pie. Found this one through a Google search and it looked good. I used half Ambrosia and half Ginger gold apples. I think Granny Smiths would have been better, it was still very good, just a little sweeter than I would have liked. 
Apple Pie#19#32#Don't use Granny Smith apples - pie came out perfectly except Granny's make it sour!
Apple Pie#12#13#Making this Apple pie for the second time and I love it. I live in Yakima, Washington and its Apple season here. I usally don't bake, but this was so easy to make and simple. I did use a little bit more sugar than it asked for in the recipe. 
Apple Pie#12#7#I used foraged'wild' Maine apples. Perfect amt. of sugar! 
Apple Pie#5#4#Perfect. I baked it longer but may have had more filling.
Apple Pie#9#2#This is pretty much how I make my apple pie but I like the idea of using brown sugar. Also it's a LOT easier to use a potato peeler to peel the apples. Nice recipe! 
Apple Pie#11#4#Delicious! Used 9 large apples and doubled the sugar-spice and it made 3 regular size pies!
Apple Pie#6#4#Well if i want a sweeter pie i thought i'd use Gala Apple's But my mom said that the texture is different and that gala Apple's would most likely fall apart so maybe in the future i'll try that. by the way love the recipe so good i used store bought so good but i'll try homemade next time! 
Apple Pie#6#2#I made it with store bought pie dough still was delicious and easy love it thank you
Apple Pie#6#4#I thought the presentation looked very delicious! The ingredients are easy to use and find!
Apple Pie#3#1#I needed to use some golden delicious apples before they went bad. Never have attempted a homemade apple pie. Used this recipe...OH MY GOODNESS, I am hooked! It is so good!
Apple Pie#10#2#Made it as a tart using half a pie crust. Loved this so simple recipe.
Apple Pie#9#5#This was delicious and I even skipped the white sugar. Due to heath and latent food allergies, I limit my sugar and I can not use sugar substitutes. Has anyone else ever altered the recipe? I think I will try it without any sugar next time. Also, can anyone recommend a tool that helps you figure out the nutrition value, this way I can see the grams of sugar based on my alterations. Thanks again, grandma knew what she was doing.
Apple Pie#8#4#I love this recipe!!!! The pie was delicious!! And it's so easy!! I did use a ready made pie crust which worked out great!!!
Apple Pie#6#2#Best apple pie filling!! The apple slices were crisp, not soggy, the recipe was easy to follow, and the advice was a plus. My friends gave the pie filling rave reviews. This will be the one I use for now on.
Apple Pie#3#4#This filling added tablespoon brandy and teaspoon vanilla, but did everything else as directed. This filling recipe is our favorite coupled with a butter and sour cream crust. Delicious!!!
Apple Pie#4#1#We LOVE this recipe! It is the only one I use for apple pie now. It has never been runny for me either, but I also do not cut into it right away.
Apple Pie#4#3#This is the 4th time I have made this pie...comes out perfect every time!!
Apple Pie#2#6#I made this pie today and it is so good ....I didn't add ginger or nutmeg. It wasn't soupy at all ! I think that comment was very nice at all. Thanks for the recipe.???? 
Apple Pie#9#6#This is probably one of the easiest apple pie recipes ever. I have been baking almost my entire life, usually using my mom's recipe. After she passed away, I was unable to replicate it, but THIS is DARN close. I only use granny smith apples, I use less sugar and brown sugar (slightly less than half a cup per pie), a bit more cinnamon, about the same nutmeg and flour. I skip the ginger, as I don't think the pie needs it. I don't care for a pie that is TOO sweet, so I am pretty liberal with the lemon juice. (I might add a teaspoon more of flour, depending on how crazy I went with the lemon juice.) I generally don't sugar the crust, but that is my preference. I made two apple and two pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving this year, and needless to say, there were NO leftovers. To those that have a problem with the filling being too wet, I suggest using extremely crisp granny smith apples. The peel should be dark green. If the texture of the apple is mealy , it is over ripe and will probably be too wet. Thanks for this great recipe and the lovely memories it gave me of baking with my mom. 
Apple Pie#6#2#I can't figure out why this is getting less than 5 stars. It was amazing! Not wet or runny at all. I used a double crust (store bought) and 5 granny Smith apples. I followed the recipe as written. Scratching my head about these other reviews. It turned out fabulous. 
Apple Pie#7#30#This isn't pie. This is soup. I don't know if the creator forgot to add a step or what, but my finished product was more liquid than apple. If this is grandmas recipe, she must have had soft teeth. Recipe should be removed. 
Apple Pie#2#17#First off, pie didn't taste bad. HOWEVER, all this talk of grandmas special apple pie is disingenuous, at best. The pie came out with a lot of liquid. I like a nice wholesome and crispy apple pie. Not a wet apple pie. This pie is Grandmas WAP (wet a** pie).
Apple Pie#4#3#This was a great classic apple pie. It did come out looking wet but you have to let fruit pies cool before you cut them. I let mine cool overnight and it was perfect the next day- no run off and no soggy bottom. For those who say the apples weren't tender, you need to test the pie by sticking it with something to make sure they are soft before you take it out. If your crust is getting too brown, put on a pie shield or foil.
Apple Pie#5#20#Made this pie for Thanksgiving Dinner. I should have read the reviews. I have made many pies, this was the absolute worst I have ever produced. I used my normal crust recipe with this one for the filling. Like the others, my crust looked beautiful, but when we cut into the pie, it was a mess of undercooked apples with a ton of runny juice. It never set up! This recipe needs to be removed, it definitely does not work the way it's published. You guys should be ashamed of it! Readers should not have to tweak your recipe in order to make it work! Remove please!
Apple Pie#1#0#I really enjoyed making this pie today. It was sweet and spiced just right. It made a hit with the family and was truly a snap to make. I did cheat by using a good quality frozen crust, I beat my egg white nicely and brushed a good bit all over the crust and then gave it a generous sprinkling of sugar. My top crust was made by using a maple leaf cookie cutter stamp and just covering the entire top of the pie with leaves. I just love how pretty it makes the pie! Just beautiful for Fall! This recipe is a keeper! Thank You!
Apple Pie#1#8#recipe sucks there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the pie even with a lattice top
Apple Pie#1#0#I made this apple pie and everyone loved it. So I made several more and its so easy. My friends asked for the recipe. I love this apple pie.
Apple Pie#4#2#Toss the apples with the lemon juice then the sugars to coat THEN cook in large skillet to start the cooking process and reduce the liquid. Med heat toss frequent cover to cook apples, after 10 look at the liquid add the flour, table spoons at a time tossing as you go. If it's tighten up take off heat then add to ready pie shell bake as before.
Apple Pie#6#0#This was my first foray into baking an apple pie. I've done lots of different cakes, pies, and cupcakes, but I've been a limited intimidated with the apple pie. Well, my son wanted an apple pie for his birthday and so, it was the right time to just go for it. I chose this recipe because it was simple and straightforward. I did read through many of the reviews, which are very mixed--from best pie to worst pie. Honestly, that made me a little nervous, but I decided to remain positive and give it a shot. The result was spectacular!!! I had my son eat the first piece and he was incredibly happy. He said it was the best pie he has ever had and went back for a 2nd even bigger slice. I took the next slice, and I was also impressed with just how good it tasted and how well everything came out. I will note that I followed the directions, without any changes. I used only Granny Smith apples and I didn't have any issues with the filling becoming too liquidy or the apples not baking well enough. The pie's taste is amazing. I thought the proportion of the spices was completely appropriate so no one spice stood out too harshly. Honestly, the hardest part for me was making the crust, which I also decided to do for the first time. I was actually worried most about the double crust, but it somehow all worked out. Phew! I would definitely recommend this recipe. It's worth taking a chance. 
Apple Pie#0#3#I'm with most of the posts about this recipe being runny and apples were not done. Very disappointed. Feel like I just wasted my time trying this recipe. Maybe this recipe is for confection ovens, IDK but I won't use it again. Something is wrong in the instructions. 
Apple Pie#1#0#Recipe is nice it taste great. But the filling is very liquidy and came out like soup even after cooking longer and resting for an hour. Was disappointed but taste great
Apple Pie#2#1#This is my first time baking an apple pie and I used store-bought crust. I combined this recipe with a recipe from Martha Stewart and I used bits of both. I had heard about cornstarch being a great thickener instead of flour and I've been experimenting with it lately. It's a great way to make sure it doesn't come out watery. I used extra sugar and just under 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. I didn't even need to use the entire thing (spices (sea salt, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, white sugar)and cornstarch mixture) . I noticed a lot of complaining in the comments about undercooked apples so I cooked everything together first and the cornstarch did its job to create a thick sauce right from the get-go. It just finished baking so I'm at the cooling stage now. I added milk, cream and sugar to my egg wash and used it on the bottom crust to help keep it from being soggy as well as Heating a baking sheet for it to cook on. I'll edit if I remember! Thanks for all the help from the comments! ?? 
Apple Pie#3#2#Wish I had read more reviews. It was awful ... I baked it 20 minutes longer than indicated and still the apples are not cooked, the filling is liquid. I used a mix of Honeycrisp and Granny Smith. I've been baking for 45+ years but am looking for a no fail apple pie. It was a beautiful pie, unfortunately it was inedible. A huge waste of an afternoon. 
Apple Pie#1#0#This is the best apple pie filling recipe I've ever used. I have learned to cook my filling until apples are half done..so the juice is less runny and your crust doesn't over brown before the apple filling is done. Since finding this recipe, I always volunteer to make the apple pies....because no one else I know can make an apple pie as good as this one. Thank you for the recipe 
Apple Pie#2#0#This is an AMAZING PIE. I actually didn't look at reviews before baking and actually kinda shocked to see them lol. I did follow the recipe to a t. Yes, I will admit the pie is a bit liquidy AT FIRST BUT after a half hour there was no more liquid pouring out. Taste wise, it's amazing you can taste everything perfectly. Maybe a little to much cinnamon, but thats preference. baking wise, it did take a little bit longer than said but if you just keep your eye on it and put foil around places that are getting to brown it'll come out beautifully. Either way would bake again, saving the recipe
Apple Pie#1#1#A doctor it up a little bit;, less sugar and a scoosh of nutmeg. I bake and give away and I'm told this is the best apple pie ever
Apple Pie#0#0#I made this pie last night and i have to say it is the best recipe i have ever tried! it was delicious and will now be my new go to apple pie recipe!!! 
Apple Pie#1#6#Worst apple pie filling recipe EVER! I followed the instructions exactly and after an hour of cooling, I cut the first piece. I had to drain more than a cup of liquid out of it. I'm so upset. Flavor is also lacking. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with this recipe. 
Apple Pie#0#0#Excellent recipe, I added a few things and tweaked the sugars. I also highly recommend using more than one type of apple for better flavor. I use Macs, cortland and Granny Smith. Makes for great flavors.
Apple Pie#1#0#I did the recipe to the T because I saw a review complain that everyone tweaks the recipe and reviews their version rather than the original recipe and they are right. So I followed the recipe exactly and it is absolutely delicious. I will critique it though. Ginger was a little too strong especially paired with the nutmeg it truly over powered the cinnamon taste. It definitely came out liquid-y however I found when you let it cool for about 45 mins the liquid becomes less runny. I used a Pillsbury pie crust. Phenomenal. I did set up the pie crust and the sugar mixture first then sliced the apples up and mix together to avoid letting the apple pie filling become to watery. Didn't really change anything. But the pie is truly delicious without adding or subtracting any ingredients.
Apple Pie#1#1#You should use milk, not egg white to brush on the pie crust. Pie crust edges do not need to be covered with foil until the end, if they're browning too quickly. Time given is not long enough to cook the filling. It needs twice as long as stated here. It also needs a higher starting temperature. It should be baked at 425 degrees for the first 20 minutes then turned down to 375 degrees to bake for a further 40 minutes or so. Also, I used Bramley apples and it came out a bit tart so I'd increase the sugar and also the flour and it is liquidy.
Apple Pie#2#0#Lovely recipe. For those who had issues with soupy pie or apples that did not cook up, try making sure that you are using a baking type apple as opposed to a snack variety. They are not successfully exchanged. 
Apple Pie#1#0#Is there an egg substitute we can use for the egg whites? Also, if we use heaping tablespoons of flour, it will prevent the filling from being too watery right? Just want to confirm.
Apple Pie#0#0#I have made this pie at least five times and each time I get rave reviews. My grandmother and mother said its the best apple pie they've ever had. I do cook it a little longer to make certain the apples aren't crunchy. Delicious ?? ?? 
Apple Pie#1#1#Really yummy, only complaint is that like other people, the pie had soooo much liquid in the bottom. No biggy though, i just poured the liquid out carefully. Next time I would use more flower of cook the apples a bit first. The taste is great though! I used a bit less ginger, just because I was afraid it would be too overpowering, and it turned out good. Will make again.
Apple Pie#0#0#Mine came out super liquidity and my apples were still crunchy. I have to bake it again. The flavor was okay.
Apple Pie#0#0#Was pretty good but small tart apples! Was awesome! I love it!
Apple Pie#0#0#This is the first apple pie I've ever mad and is seriously one of THE BEST apple pies I've ever tasted!!! I followed the heaping tablespoon suggestion for the flour but all the other directions as is. I believe I've made another dish better than my mother-in-law and she's been making her pie for well over 50 years. My husband was pleasantly surprised! 
Apple Pie#2#1#OMG, this was an amazing pie. I have made so many things for my family and me, and this was by far their favorite thing I've ever made. I read the reviews before and used heaping tablespoons and it worked out great. I didn't measure out my lemon juice. I honestly just poured whatever the apples needed :D I actually really liked a little bit of that lemon flavor. I would recommend some more some cinnamon, but I really love cinnamon so that's your choice lol. I used a pre-made frozen pie crust, and as you can see, it worked out great. Ovbiously, I had to buy some more to get the top covered. I recommend to not be shy with the egg whites! I brushed all the egg white on the top, and I'm glad I did. I thought about not using all of it, but I did, and got a great pie. All in all, this was the most awesome pie ever! SO glad I found this recipe. &lt;3 
Apple Pie#0#0#This pie was delicious! It was the first homemade pie I ever made, but the recipe was easy, it included items I usually already have in the kitchen, and it didn't take much time to prep. However, I only had Gala apples which made the pie perfectly sweet, but not too sweet. I didn't have any ginger so I missed out on that intended kick the recipe included. The top layer of my crust was still raw after 25 mins, so I added 13 more minutes...it was then half- undercooked, so I added 10 more minutes and adjusted to 400 degrees. Maybe I had the pie on a rack too low in the oven. All I know that in the end, it was delicious! 
Apple Pie#1#0#I'm a 14 year old baker and I've always wanted to make an apple pie but I always thought it was too hard. I found this recipe and I was astonished by how easy it seemed. This pie came out so well when I made it. My whole family loved it so I already made it twice in the last week! This apple pie recipe is so good and very simple to make. I will definitely continue to make this pie for the rest of my life!
Apple Pie#0#0#i don't recommend this recipe. The pie had a lot of juice left at the bottom but the pie was still dry. I followed the recipe exactly and it looked good until i tried it. TOO MUCH cinnamon and nutmeg and my apples were still crunchy...
Apple Pie#0#0#This was the second time I used this recipe. Thos time I used granny Smith's rather than red delicious and the pie came out much better since it wasn't overly sweet. The ginger also adds a nice touch. 
Apple Pie#0#0#This pie is amazing! I like pie, but my family doesn't really care for it. My daughter received a school assignment to bak an apple pie, so this is the one we chose. I only made one change; I didn't have any cardamon so I sprinkled I a pinch of all-spice instead. The pie took longer to bake than directed, but the end result was worth the wait! I found the Taste of Home pie notes listed right after the recipe helpful, and also followed one of the the reviewer's recommendations to use heaping tablespoons full of flour. The pie wasn't runny or dry; it was just perfect! The only change I will make next time is to add another cup pf apples. I used 7 cups of thinly sliced honey crisps, but they cooked down quite a bit. My daughter has declared this the only pie she likes, and my husband refused to let me take a couple of pieces to my parents; he wanted the leftovers for himself! 
Apple Pie#0#0#I've not tried this yet but I would like to know why lumps of butter were put inside please? 
Apple Pie#0#0#Best apple pie I ever made! I will say one thing, I put heaping tablespoons of flour and it came out perfect. After reading a review saying they heaped the flour, I decided to do that. It came out perfect! Thank you Taste of Home! My family was so thrilled with my pie!
Apple Pie#0#0#It really looked delicious! I can't wait to try it !!!Thank you!
Apple Pie#0#0#This pie was delicious !!! After reading the reviews I decided to make the tablespoons of flour into heaping tablespoons and the pie turned out perfect. Will be making this one again!
Apple Pie#0#0#I made this pie last night, followed the recipe exactly, used gala apples and it came out perfect. great pie!!
Apple Pie#0#0#First time making homemade pie and it's delicious!!!! Very easy to follow...thank you! 
Apple Pie#1#0#PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL and limit comments to only the RECIPE, and ADVISE others. do not attack another's character with with profanity (baker2) ...... Keep in mind that MANY have NEVER, ever baked before. 
Apple Pie#1#0#laughing at all those who don't realize that you cannot cut into an apple pie that's fresh out of the oven. great recipe
Apple Pie#0#0#Needs a thickening agent. I let this pie sit for over a day and a half and it was still way too runny. Had a decent taste but the cinnamon and nutmeg was a bit over powering.
Apple Pie#0#0#I do not recommend this recipe. The cooking times are way off and there was so much juice in the pie I had to dump most of the juice out.
Apple Pie#0#0#Update to earlier post. I did not use ginger /nutmeg- only bc none on hand .. still 5????
Apple Pie#0#0#FOR those complaining about the juice that comes out of the pie right when you take it out that's normal you have to let it rest like the direcrions say so it can jellify, so yes Gavin you threw away a perfectly good pie, DAB
Apple Pie#0#0#Very Quick and easy - I usually use 5-6 small apples to make 9-inch pie crust.
Apple Pie#0#0#This was terrible it looked good when i took it out of the oven and when i cut into it a ton of liquid came out. I was so excited to make the pie and ended up just throwing it away. Would not recommend.
Apple Pie#0#0#My pie turned out beautiful and then I cut into it... full of liquid and overly sweet! Such a disappointment.
Apple Pie#0#0#I have a ton of apples and decided to make Apple pie. I've always heard Granny Smith apples make the best pies. It turns out it's because tart apples have the most pectin and other apples can make your pie soupy. Lesson learned... either use Granny Smith or allow apples to macerate and release juices prior to baking. Watery or not, the pie was still delicious!
Apple Pie#0#0#Best apple pie I've ever made! And I have it on good authority - two experts at eating apple pie - a grandson and a neighbour! 
Apple Pie#0#1#Very bad recipe pie turned out horrible baking time and oven temperature are way off.
Apple Pie#0#0#These recipes look great! It's awesome to see so many delicious recipes in one place.
Apple Pie#0#0#A classic treat. Followed the recipe exactly except for the egg wash and sugar on top of the crust at the end.
Apple Pie#0#0#Best apple pie ever
Apple Pie#0#0#Amazing
Apple Pie#0#0#Awesome. Great recipe. And I believe that the 1/2 c sugar means white sugar. Because I don't know of any other sugars. 
Apple Pie#0#0#The amount of white sugar isn't listed on the recipe. This info would be helpful. 
Apple Pie#0#0#I have never baked a pie before but this came out amazing ! I didn't use any ginger and only used 2lbs of apples witch I recommend. I also used Macintosh apples (they were a tad bit sour) But over all it was very delicious !!
Apple Pie#0#0#Outstanding!!! Used Granny Smith apples - got rave reviews from all folks at the campground. I didn't have nutmeg and forgot to add the butter - oh well. Still awesome taste and texture the next day. Definitely a keeper to make again with homemade vanilla ice cream. Yummy. 
Apple Pie#0#0#Second time making.....first time too much liquid......i used my canned apples...drained all juice.........put extra cinnamon.......excellent.....! Will continue using this simple recipe.....
Apple Pie#0#0#Way too much ginger and nutmeg in this recipe. I even had more apples than called for and it was overpowering. Cut back the cinnamon, and just add a pinch of the nutmeg and ginger. Let the apples be the hero.
Apple Pie#0#0#I think the recipe is delicious. I noticed some of you found it soupy. Not that I am an expert but I think some apples have more juice in them then others. Maybe if you are using an extra juicy apple you will have to add a little more flour. Just a suggestion.
Apple Pie#0#0#I have been baking this recipe for years and love to experiment with a combination of different apples when available here in Namibia. The only time I have been disappointed is when I did not bake it long enough. Now I always check for the clear syrup to bubble out of the vent before removing from the oven. Great Flavor and very easy to make.
Apple Pie#0#0#This apple pie is has amazing flavor. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the fact it turned out a little soupy and the apples stayed really firm however because it tasted so good everyone loved it. Next time I make it I'm going to try cooking the apple mixture a little before putting it into pie shell to try to thicken it up a bit and soften apples a little. This recipe is definitely a keeper!
Apple Pie#0#0#Hos TL make the pie Crust at home
Apple Pie#0#0#I left am earlier review and forgot to add that I halved the white and brown sugar. My family and I have health issues so I had to tone the sugar down but it was soooooo good! Thanks for sharing
Apple Pie#0#0#Very easy to make. Thank you
Apple Pie#0#0#BEST apple pie i have ever tasted... just the right combination of ingredients. i followed the recipe exactly as it was written and it was really excellent. Everyone i shared the pie with agreed, it was the BEST.. i loved the story about your granny.... that was just the best.... i will forever think of her everytime i make this pie - which will be often.
Apple Pie#0#0#Followed the recipe to the letter. Pie looked great on the outside, but was a soupy mess on the inside. I will not make this again and I do not recommend it.
Apple Pie#0#0#Extremely tasty! Had some liquid inside but was delicious otherwise.
Apple Pie#0#0#Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. Will be making for Christmas.
Apple Pie#0#0#Came out like soup with 1 TBS of liquid The apples didn't get soft
Apple Pie#0#0#Best recipe I've used in a long time!
Apple Pie#0#0#This recipe turned out great! I just made it for thanksgiving. I did add an extra tbsp of flour as other reviewers advised, and the results were not runny at all, or dry. Also for the sugar I let my half cups measures be slightly short, and it didn't turn out too sweet. Also for the ginger, instead of powder I used paste and slightly more since its fresh. I used 4 granny Smith, and 2 honeycrisp apples. The results were fabulous. I've made apple pie in the past using recipes found here or there and the flavor was always missing something. I'm not sure if it is the use of ginger, or that I use ceylon cinnamon, but this recipe is a keeper. 
Apple Pie#0#0#This was a hit. I left the sugar the same but used about 9 cups of sliced apples-we like our pie deep dish.
Apple Pie#0#0#what kind of crust do I use?
Apple Pie#0#0#Wonderful pie!!!
Apple Pie#0#0#The pie is tooooooo sweet. Use less sugar
Apple Pie#0#0#I'm going to make this for Xmas but I will have the amount of sugar! 
Apple Pie#0#0#This is a wonderful apple pie recipe, best I've made. Ive seen some reference to the pie being soupy. I didn't experience that at all. We let the pie rest for a few hours after it came out of the oven. It was perfect when we sliced and served (a la mode of course! ) 
Apple Pie#0#0#So at first the pie was soupy when I took a slice, but the flavors were amazing. The pie sat in the fridge all last night and all day today, it still looked soupy were the slice was taken. I took another slice and...no more soup! This recipe is great, thanks for sharing (I wouldn't!).
Apple Pie#0#0#Very good apple pie recipe! I lost my cookbook that I had for 30 years, which contained my Apple Pie Recipe. I had an idea of all the ingredients I needed but wasn't quite sure on the measurements. Found your recipe and it was fabulous! I love the use of all 3 spices and the brown sugar. Thanks for sharing this recipe! It's already in my new cookbook I've started. :) 
Apple Pie#0#0#This is by far the best apple pie I have ever made and eaten. I think it is the brown sugar instead of all white sugar. Whatever it is it is fantastic!
Apple Pie#0#0#I have been making this exact pie for many years but in my recipe I have 1/4 tsp cloves instead of ginger, which I do prefer. I like my pie mildly sweet so I only add 1/4 cup each of the sugars. I find the apples have a good amount of there own sugar, even Granny Smiths. I also blind bake my bottom crust, I find the crust doesn't become soggy this way. This is an excellent recipe. Thx Maggie
Apple Pie#0#0#Every hood and tastu!
Apple Pie#0#0#The best apple pie I have ever eaten!!!
Apple Pie#0#0#I tried this recipe for the first time today. It was the easiest way to make a delicious apple pie. I will never have to buy a apple pie again. I will continue using this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing it.
Apple Pie#0#0#I love this pie and make it often! I've found that thinner and consistent apple slices are best, and you have to let it cool completely (up to 2 hours) to avoid soupiness. I also like to do an open weave with the top crust, which may allow for extra evaporation. Lastly, I cook it for about an hour total 30 with foil, 30 without.
Apple Pie#0#0#This pie was a soupy mess! I even followed the advice of another reviewer and reduced the juices and sugars of the apples before assembling the pie. Also, the apples were very thinly sliced and did not cook through after 50 minutes of baking when the crust was done. The flavors were very good but the way it baked up was unacceptable, especially for so much work. I'd be less disappointed if I had used a store bought crust and saved the time and effort. Will NOT make this again. 
Apple Pie#0#0#BEST apple pie recipe that I've ever made. Everyone loved it. 
Apple Pie#0#0#Flavorful and delicious!
Apple Pie#0#0#For a pie novice like me this was an easy recipe to put together, the taste of apple mixture was good. My problem was that the apples were a little too soft. I cooked the pie the amount of time stated in the recipe. Maybe I sliced them too thin or I overcooked it. How thick should the apples cut ? I used 7 cups of Granny Smith apples. I am a better cake baker but this was a marvelous start to perfect ! Cannot wait to try it again. My husband said it was good never the less......
Apple Pie#0#0#It's a good recipe. I opted out the ginger just because I'm not much of a ginger fan. I used 6 granny Smiths apple and 1honey crisp. It was alittle too Tarte. Next time I'll use another honey crisp apple and less granny Smiths. Wish I could add a picture. 
Apple Pie#0#0#Wonderful! The best apple pie I have made in a long time. I think the added brown sugar really made it good. I made one today for company and my husband is already asking me to make another one. :) It looks like apple pie will be served at Thanksgiving dinner as well.
Apple Pie#0#0#fabulous and what a pie....
Apple Pie#0#0#Great recipe. I used 6 cups of apples and 4 T of flour and it was perfect. I used granny smith apples. Thanks for the recipe. It is my new go to recipe for apple pie.
Apple Pie#1#0#I made this pie today and it turned out very nice but next time I'll skip the ginger. About apples, if you live in an area that has fresh picked apples you are very lucky. Apples after being stored lose moisture and this will cause your pie to be dry unless you add a little fluid or less flour. Used fresh picked Granny Smith (4) and only (2) Honeycrisp because they were huge and so sweet and tart too. All in all, this 85 year old man is glad he found this recipe. 
Apple Pie#0#0#For a novice pie crafter, I and my coworkers raved about this recipe. Easy and unnaturally delicious.I used Granny Smith, Breaburn and Jonagolds for two pies, just enough tart and sweet and bulk for pie filling. I'll keep this for other times when apple pies are called for. 
Apple Pie#0#0#No hassle apple pie recipe. Cooked to perfection.
Apple Pie#0#0#Delicious pie! I used my favorite go-to homemade pastry dough recipe for the crust. I used 4 granny smith apples and 2 honeycrisp apples . That combination was perfect for us. Just the right amount of tart and sweet. TIP FOR ALL: If you dont want runny pies heres what to do; Mix your fruit with your sugars and lemon juice, let sit for at least 30 minutes, dump the juices that have been rendered out into a small sauce pan, boil it gently for about 5-10 minutes to form a syrup (you can add a teaspoon or so more of sugar at this point to thicken up your syrup if needed) let it cool slightly then add it back to your fruit and sugar, mix well then add your flour. This works every single time with every kind of pie. You will not have any more runny pie filling. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!
Apple Pie#0#0#Followed this recipe to the'T'. Beautiful Pie. Knife blade pulled dry in 30 minutes. Cooled pie and found it had about 3/4 of juice free in the bottom of the pie. Was a soggy mess. 
Apple Pie#0#0#WOW!! Being a lover of Apple Pie,I was always intimidated to attempt to bake one.Well I got brave tonight and I went for it.This is the best Apple Pie I've ever eaten in my life,and I made it.I love taste of home,I've made some delicious meals from the recipes.This one I'll be making for years to come.Absolutely Delicious 
Apple Pie#0#0#This is the perfect apple pie! I used my own pie crust recipe though because it is tried and true. Two tips abou the pie filling. 1). I used a combination of Jonagold and Granny Smith apples but increased the amount of apple to 9 cups. This was just right for the stated amount of sugar, flour, and seasoning. Juicy but not runny. 2). Baking time needs to be increased substantially. I started with the stated time but the pie was not nearly done. Baked another 30 minutes, checking frequently to be sure it was not over baking. Apples should be nice and oozy and very tender. With these two minor modifications, fabulous results! 
Apple Pie#0#0#Overall, I like the recipe, Like others, I think either a little extra flower or some cornstarch would be good to help soak up some of the juices. That might vary based on the top of apple.My crust turned out great! But even with 5 extra minutes, my apples still weren't tender enough. I used Honeycrisp and a few golden delicious. I wish now that I'd either tried another reviewer's tip of covering the whole top with tin foil (so I could have baked it longer), or perhaps cooking the apples in a sauce pan for 5 minutes to give them a head start. P.S. I probably would have chosen Jonathans or Jonagolds if my store had them. :-/ 
Apple Pie#0#0#I'm not a usually a fan of pie but a lot of people in my family like it so I decided to make it. I listened to the other reviewers and added an extra 1/2 tbsp of flour. And I added a little extra cinnamon because who doesn't like extra cinnamon? Anyway the pie came out perfect. It had fantastic flavor and wasn't very runny. 
Apple Pie#0#0#Apple pie is my husband's favourite, but I rarely make it. Yesterday I picked up a 2 pack Tenderflake crust, and made this for him. It went over well. I did omit the ginger (preference), but next time I'd reduce the nutmeg a bit too.I found it a bit too sweet, but that may have been because I used Gala apples and they were quite sweet. I'd like to try it with Granny Smith next time. 
Apple Pie#0#0#We just moved into a house we bought and it had apple trees, don't know what kind they were but the sauce did not thicken up . My crust was good does it matter what kind of apples i used? I cooked it longer then what it said . any suggestions for next time? 
Apple Pie#0#0#The best apple pie I have ever tasted. My homemade crust was pretty good also.
Apple Pie#0#0#Fantastic pie. I use 1 tab. cornstarch w/ 2 tab. flour. I don't like nutmeg so I use ALL cinnamon. 
Apple Pie#0#0#Very good, just a bit too much nutmeg though since we don't really like it. I'll try cloves instead next time. 
Apple Pie#0#0#Wonderful recipe. The only thing I did different was leave out all spices since I love the taste of only apples. I also laid a piece of foil over entire pie first 25 min then uncovered and finished baking 25-30 min until apples are tender when pie poked with thin knife.
Apple Pie#0#0#This is my go to apple pie recipe. So easy and so delicious. Love it!
Apple Pie#0#1#I wish there was a higher rating then five stars. This was my. First homemade apple pie and it came out the best I've had in my life and that's not just because I made it haha. There were a few different changes I made and that is 1. I used the homemade pie crust recipe off of crisco container. 2. I skipped the egg white and made a melted butter with sugar and cinnamon to brush on before baking. I know it's not the healthier choice but it added some great flavor to the crust. 3. I substituted the flour for tapioca because my grandmothers secret is it adds a little extra sweetness and flavor. Also I forgot to set the timer and didn't read the cover with foil part so I accidentally skipped out on that so it was uncovered for about 45 minutes. Apples weren't mushy but also not hard . Right in the middle. I used janigolds and Mitzu apples that we picked at the orchard. 
Apple Pie#0#0#awesome pie.reminds me of home in the fall .playing outside as a kid down to my grandmothers. smelling the pie mixed with the ocean breeze. salt air .spruce trees and a homemade apple pie.cannot beat them three smells together. along with the waves crashing the beach.Ahhhhh wish i was back home in maine.
Apple Pie#0#0#This was the best apple pie i have ever tasted in my life. I made it exactly as written, so simple and nobody believed i made it. Thank goodness my daughter witnessed it. Thanks so much
Apple Pie#0#0#excellent flavor....used Granny Smith apples..they are my favorite!!
Apple Pie#0#0#Only one thing I didn't go covet the pan first. The sticks at the bottom. 
Apple Pie#0#0#I made it exactly as written. It turned out excellent!
Apple Pie#0#0#I couldn't find any egg whites or some of the other ingredients but it turned out perfect none the less. I might be only 14, but this was very simple and exciting! It was the first thing I'd ever made on my own. Adding extra butter made it even better. Sometimes accidents make things better. I used a Wholly Wholesome gluten free crust because I have celiac. 
Apple Pie#0#0#Great recipie
Apple Pie#0#0#This recipe is fantastic. I would NOT, however, add much extra flour. I took the advice of some previous reviews and used 5 tbsp flour instead of the recommend 3 tbsp, and the pie filling was too sticky. Next time I will use 3-4 and it should be perfect :)
Apple Pie#0#0#I loved this recipe! It was simple and just what I was looking for. I loved the sugar on top of the crust. I used pink lady apples. The perfect combination of sweet and tart!
Apple Pie#0#0#I have found THE apple pie recipe for keeps. My husband and 29 yearold son were drooling over this pie! I used granny smith apples,4 tablespoons of flour (not one drippy run), didn't have nutmeg, butused a little pumpkin pie spice, and cardamom in addition to cinnamonand ginger. I used Trader Joe's pie dough and I'm telling you it is utterlydelicious!! 
Apple Pie#0#0#Only 6 more days before my husband deploys and an apple pie was on his list of wants. I have never made an apple pie before and was scared this would be a big flop. To my surprise this is the best apple pie I have ever tasted. Glad I could make this for him. Thanks so much!
Apple Pie#0#0#I made this pie for my very first Thanksgiving with the in-laws. Luckily I tried the recipe out a week before thanksgiving. I made the first pie exactly like the recipe says to. It turned out very runny, but tasty nonetheless. I then made another pie with the suggestions of other reviewers. I upped the flour to 5Tbsp and used a little more brown sugar than granulated. I was also stumped on which apples to use. So I went to my local market and grabbed 2 of each they had. I ended up with Gala, HoneyCrisp, and Sweet Tango. OMG! This pie was absolutely splendid. Thank you to everyone who submits a review so newbies like myself can bake something as easy as Apple pie.
Apple Pie#0#0#My very first Apple Pie and it was delicious ~
Apple Pie#0#0#Wonderful. I made this w my daughter, it was simple to make and delicious to eat! Yum!
Apple Pie#0#0#Awesome... Tapioca to thwart the runs... Winner! Also, NO ginger. Don't like! 
Apple Pie#0#0#This was my first apple pie I've ever made. My family and I loved it. Great flavor. Wouldn't change anything, it's perfect. 
Apple Pie#0#0#Great! Like it says, it's pretty runny but I just put it in the fridge overnight and it was perfect! 
Apple Pie#0#0#My suggestion to stop runny juice...sprinkle 2-3 tablespoons of instant tapioca. Put some on bottom crust, some inbetween , and finish with a little on top. When juices are bubbling thru slits in top crust, tapioca will thicken this as it cools. Delicious!
Apple Pie#0#0#Was disappointed in the runniest of this pie. Had to use several paper towels to sop up runny juices. Did not read reviews before putting top crust on. Would suggest Taste of Home re-write recipe. It for sure needs more flour. On the upside has a good flavor. We used HoneyCrisp, Gala, MacIntosh and some sort of fancy apple. Just disappointed it was runny.
Apple Pie#0#0#Good flavor, but very runny.
Apple Pie#0#0#I never write reviews, but this pie was awesome! It was quick and easy to make and had the perfect combination of spices. Also, for those of you who were wondering, you'd need about 5 regular sized apples.The only thing I would change is the sugar, it was a bit too much for my family. I would cut one of the sugars in half, also I did not listen others and increase the flour, but It may have helped the runnyness. It was not runny per say but could have used a bit of extra thickener. Lastly I made this in a regular round metal cake pan with the same cooking time and it worked out great. Thanks for a lovely recipe!*I used criscos no fail pie crust recipe 
Apple Pie#0#0#I used all granny smiths, which weighed 2.97 lbs. The spices and sugar amounts were right on, actually perfecto! Sliced apples real thin, about 1/16 inch or so. Increased flour to 5 tblsps. Consistency of cooked mixture was very nice. My supreme critic, Wifey, said she would have used a couple of Macs or Fujis, thought a couple of apple slices were a little hard - though she gobbled it down. First time for me with a two crust pie. Will add a Fuji or two in the next attempt with this wonderful recipe.Which will be soon. With ice cream maybe? Perfect on its own. I used a 1-2-3 crust recipe listed on the net. Excellent and easy pie crust recipe. 
Apple Pie#0#0#I made this for a pie auction at church and it had the room buzzing! The winning bidder told me later in the week that it was fantastic!
Apple Pie#0#0#May I request the complete recipe for the double crust?
Apple Pie#0#0#This was the best pie ever. Easy to follow and easy to modify to own tastes (less sugar).Thank you.
Apple Pie#0#0#Followed the recipe word for word. I let the pie cool over night, but it was runny!!! The flavor was great though! Guess I should have listened to other reviews, and added extra flour.
Apple Pie#0#0#This recipe is AWESOME!!!! Simple and easy to follow directions.
Apple Pie#0#0#This was fabulous! Thank you for sharing
Apple Pie#0#0#I never thought to put ginger in my apple pie. Pumpkin pie, sure, but NEVER apple. Then this recipe came along and showed me another way. It's SO yummy! It seems like an insignificant amount, but the ginger really adds some zing! 
Apple Pie#0#0#Loved this! It's beautiful to look at and so tasty too! 
Apple Pie#0#0#FANTASTIC! Made this for Thanksgiving dinner this year, after family agreed they wanted an apple pie. The filling set up perfect, so cut like a dream. I loved the spice and sugar levels, was just perfect. Will be adding to my go-to list of desserts. :)
Apple Pie#0#0#I had to use orange juice instead of lemon and I added 1/2 cup blueberries it was a great recipe
Apple Pie#0#0#Am I the only one who cannot see what temperature to bake this at?
Apple Pie#0#0#Excellent flavor! Everyone loved it.
Apple Pie#0#0#Easy to follow recipe. Very easy prep, & we baked a perfect home made apple pie. The entire house smelled wonderful! I highly recommend this recipe for the novice baker, along with accomplished bakers as well. We were very happy with the results. We used a mixture of granny smith apples and fuji apples. It was beautiful,and tasted just as great! Highly recommend for anyone who wants to impress their family with a gorgeous, homemade pie. PS. It was just as good cold the next day, or even reheated in the microwave. I felt proud of our efforts. Sincerely, Mrs. Vance
Apple Pie#0#0#So good. And I even forgot to dot with the buter before adding the top crust! Rave reviews from entire family.
Apple Pie#0#0#I made this pie, the taste was excellent but it was so runny. I went back through recipe to see if I missed anything but I hadn't. Any idea why. The apples were soft but still in shape. 
Apple Pie#0#0#I forgot to click on the stars to rate this recipe when I wrote my review. I give it 5 yummy stars.
Apple Pie#0#0#This is the first dessert our guests grab at our Labor Day barbecue. I bake 2 of these delicious apple pies and they are gone almost as soon as I put them on the table.
Apple Pie#0#0#I make this pie with soft white wheat flour and replace the sugar with succannot. EVERYONE LOVES it and we don't have to feel to guilty.:) I have made it for church and it is always gone. 
Apple Pie#0#0#This is a very easy apple pie and delicious. I use orange juice if I don't have lemon . It is a good pie to make an impression, if you are a first time pie maker. The pie crust from a box is tasty. I have made this apple pie recipe a few times . 
Apple Pie#0#0#My first apple pie & my lifelong recipe. Be sure to COOL COMPLETELY before slicing! I used this filling in empanadas & wontons, too!
Apple Pie#0#0#This will be my new go-to apple pie recipe - it's great! I used all Granny Smith apples and added two extra tablespoons of flour as recommended here by some and it came out perfect. I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of caramel sauce and it was a huge hit! 
Apple Pie#0#0#Excellent taste. Totally worth trying. Definitely a classic.
Apple Pie#0#0#I've used this recipe for the last two Thanksgivings and it comes out great! I read the reviews and decided to scoop the apples out of the large bowl, instead of pouring them. That kept the pie from being too soupy. This recipe is a keeper! 
Apple Pie#0#0#This is an amazing Apple Pie - it is yummy and reheats very well! A big hit at our New Year's Eve party. Will repeat recipe for the next family/friends event. Highly recommended! 
Apple Pie#0#0#I've made this pie twice now and it was delicious both times! One variation that my dad remembers from his childhood is to use an oatmeal crisp on top rather than a second pie crust. I used the crisp recipe from this site Winning Apple Crisp but made the rest of the pie as directed on this site, covering the entire pie for the first 20 minutes. Incredible! 
Apple Pie#0#0#Made this pie for Thanksgiving, was going to make a pumpkin pie, but then my son-in-law gave me some apples, so made this one instead, and everyone loved it.
Apple Pie#0#0#I made this pie for thanksgiving dinner. It was great. Will make it again.
Apple Pie#0#0#I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and found it to be the absolute best apple pie I have ever tasted. Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe.
Apple Pie#0#0#instead of all tart apples I used granny smith buabaum abd fujie apples and increast the cinnimon to 1 1/2 teaspoons turned out fantastic
Apple Pie#0#0#I lost my Mom's recipe and tried this one. It was easy to make and had great flavor. My fiance went back for a second serving so I know it was good! 
Apple Pie#0#0#My review didn't show the 5 stars I gave this recipe, so resubmitting. 
Apple Pie#0#0#I made this at the spur of the moment for company today. I had the pie prepared & in the oven in less than an hour. I used the silicone pie crust protector that I got from the Shop Taste of Home web site & it worked great! My pie turned out perfect & the only thing I will change next time is I will bake it just a tad longer or maybe at a slightly higher temp as I am at a high altitude.
Apple Pie#0#0#This turned out great family loved it and like another person I forgot the butter too. It was still great with out it. Would be really good with homemade whip cream.
Apple Pie#0#0#I get asked for this recipe all the time!
Apple Pie#0#1#I made the Apple Pie today. Came out ok. I read the other reviews several cooks said they added additional flour to thicken the mixture. I used granny smith apples so they don't produce a lot of juice so I didn't need the addition flour that is required in with more juicy apples. I did find the pie was a bit too sweet. My fault again I should have tasted my apples. 
Apple Pie#0#0#I maid this for my brother and sister in law but as I was putting it in I realizedthat I forgot the butter.They said that it was the best apple pie that they ever had.(I still think that it could of used butter:)
Apple Pie#0#0#I add some oatmeal to absorb some of the juice.
Apple Pie#0#0#So good and so easy. My husband loves it so It is definitely a keeper. I used green apples since that was what I had on hand and they were delicious.
Apple Pie#0#0#Truly delicious. I've found my favourite pie recipe. 
Apple Pie#0#0#I also use the additional 3 Tablespoons of flour. I also normally use two or three different kinds of apples. This is by far our favorite recipe!
Apple Pie#0#0#Very good!! First apple pie I made..definately will make again!
Apple Pie#0#1#This is the first apple pie I have made and it got rave reviews. I went by the recipe using 7 cups of apples. I used half Gala and half Braeburn and sliced them pretty thin. I found the pie to be a good consistency, not runny at all, even after cutting, the filling does not run out in the empty area.
Apple Pie#0#0#Made only one of these pies for Thanksgiving. I cut it into tiny slices so that none would be wasted by my grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Only those who were at my house first got any! My son who does not care for sweets ate about half of the pie. His son who does not like apple pie ate two slices of it and loved it. The rest of us got a sliver of it and wanted more!! I made it with Splenda in place of the sugar as my husband and I are diabetic. Needless to say, I am making at least three or four of these pies for Christmas. I am sure there will be none left over!!
Apple Pie#0#0#Made this recipe today to take to friends' for dinner. She's diabetic so swapped out the sugars for Splendas & added 5 T. of flour - got 2 thumbs up!!! It set up beautifully! Everyone loved it (better than my mom's & i didn't think that was possible!!). Definitely a keeper!! 
Apple Pie#0#0#This pie filling is the best I have ever had....and I didn't use a regular pie crust...I used the pie crust from the Dutch Apple Pie recipe...to die for!!!! 
Apple Pie#0#0#This is the first Applie Pie I have ever made, and I recieved many compliments from it.I did additional flour as the reviews had said.One family member actually said that it tasted just like Grandma's pies used to.... that is the best compliment anyone could give me! =)I will definatley make it again. 
Apple Pie#0#0#I never made an apple pie before so this was my first attempt. Everybody loved it! In fact, I've made this 4 times in just 2 weeks. 
Apple Pie#0#0#I made this recipe for the first time on Thanksgiving this year. I had read through the reviews and I added 3 tbs of flour to the dry mix. After tossing the apples there was still some mixture left in the bowl, which I proceeded to sprinkle evenly over the apples before placing top crust. It came out great. It was my first time making apple pie myself and this was as easy as can be. I will definitely make this one again. I did not find it too sweet at all, but I will try different apples with it as the Granny Smiths I used were really tart. The sweetness is a matter of taste. Thank you for sharing this recipe.
Apple Pie#0#0#Way to watery.
Apple Pie#0#0#This was a great recipe and really easy to make! I used granny smith apples. It was a little sweet but by reading other reviews, maybe I will add a little mor flour next time. Yum!
Apple Pie#0#0#All in all, it's a good pie. The 5 stars deceived me though. It's way, way, way too runny. I should have read the reviews in addition checking the star rating. So if you're getting ready to bake this pie, do NOT dump the coated apples onto the pie crust under any circumstances (unless you like apple pie soup). 
Apple Pie#0#0#I recently went to an apple festival in NC. I had never made a pie before, any pie, and wanted to give it a try. I used honey crisp apples from Grandads Farm and a pie crust recipe from this site. I carefully followed all directions. Absolutely wonderful!
Apple Pie#0#0#Loved it and so did everyone that tried it. Great thank you!
Apple Pie#0#0#Wonderful pie, its the only recipe Ill use.
Apple Pie#0#0#Made this tonight and the flavour is amazing. I did add extra flour to thicken as well (will probably add more next time perhaps an extra 2T) Also added a couple of sprinkles of watkins apple pie spice. Kids probably would have eaten it all if I had let them. I may reduce the sugar a tad next time but still enjoyed just the same.
Apple Pie#0#0#I just made this apple pie today and it came out wonderful! That's saying a lot because I am not a big fan of apple pie. I added a tiny bit of clove because I like that flavor. Great recipe! 
Apple Pie#0#0#We loved the pie, after reading the reviews I did added 3 heafing tablespoons of flour to thicken the pie. Came out great I served the Apple Pie for dinner with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the top.
Apple Pie#0#0#As a member of our local American Legion, I often donate baked goods to our monthly steak nights. What says America more than homemade apple pie! This recipe is super easy and delicious! Will definitely make again and again!
Apple Pie#0#0#This pie is great! Everyone loves it, everytime. It isn't too sweet for me. To avoid it being runny, scoop the apples out of the bowl instead of dumping them into the crust. That way, any leftover mixture that didn't coat onto the apples will remain in the bowl. A+ Recipe! 
Apple Pie#0#0#I've never made a pie before, and I used this Apple Pie Recipe as my first attempt and it turned out Great! YUM! :) 
Apple Pie#0#0#Over and over and over. This is by far the best apple pie recipe I have found.
Apple Pie#0#0#Very good recipe. Didn't last long at my house. 
Apple Pie#0#0#This is a great recipe! I added 8 cups of apples and 2 tbls of butter. Next time I would add 1/4 tsp of ground cloves to add a little zest to it. It came out soupy but I let it sit overnight and it was fine. I will be making this again for sure!
Apple Pie#0#0#my favorite apple pie recipe. Sometimes I add a little pumpkin pie spice as well just to spice it up a notch
Apple Pie#0#0#its awesome but my came out runny even though i followed directions exactly and let it cool for 2 hrs.
Apple Pie#0#0#Family Favorite!
Apple Pie#0#0#very good recipe!! very easy to make and tasted wonderful! i also added some caramel syrup to it :) yummmmm
Apple Pie#0#0#Love this recipe. I used ready made pie crust by Pillsbury. Other than that i stuck to the recipe. It was a big hit with my family. So easy!!
Apple Pie#0#0#It is a tad bit sweet.. so when I make it next time I will cut down the sugar some. Otherwise it was fantastic!!
Apple Pie#0#0#I decided to make it today after reading the reviews, but it was extremely sweet. I won't make it again. 
Apple Pie#0#0#This is sooo good!
Apple Pie#0#0#Yum Yum! This pie was very easy to make and very delicious.
Apple Pie#0#0#Perfect Apple Pie Recipe! This will stay in my recipe file forever.
Apple Pie#0#0#Tasted just like apple pie should. YUMMY.
Apple Pie#0#0#Apple Pie,Wow!! So yummy. I added 1/2 tsp. of Apple Pie spice to the rest of the ingredients it was great. Thumbs up on this recipe.
Apple Pie#0#0#this pie is very good classic apple pie
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#6#0#I cut up the tortillas to layer in pan instead of leaving whole so it is easier to cut or spoon out of dish and I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream to cut calories
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#8#0#Excellent recipe. I used Corn tortillas.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#3#1#Will this feed a family of 6 that eats like an army?
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#7#4#Everyone liked it, even my picky eater gave it a 4/10 which is pretty good. LOL. The kind of recipe you can adapt to your tastes and add/subtract things. I followed the recipe except I used corn tortillas and fried them as others suggested and I found the bottom too hard to cut so follow the instructions and put them in uncooked. I also added green onion as a garnish.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#14#3#Made as written except added hot sauce to beef used whole package of taco seasoning and split between meat and sour cream. Used extra cheese and put lettuce and tomato on side so everyone could add their own. Only reason is for reheating left overs. Was yummy, quick and easy.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#8#1#Big hit in our house! I use corn tortillas and leave out the Italian dressing because it's not something I keep on hand. Have already made this three times and it's on the menu again for this weekend, the whole family loves it. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#68#19#I'm always surprised when someone changes a recipe and then rates their own recipe! If you want to give the original recipe a rating, you'll need to actually make it as it was written. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#8#15#Made this with only 4 low-carb tortillas, ricotta cheese instead of sour cream (had more of that). Added shredded cheese to each individual serving. Used a turkey breakfast sausage for meat- had on hand. Cut calories!!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#13#4#I thought this was delicious, and my whole family agreed!! I did read the comments before making it, and saw that one suggested using more taco seasoning which I did, and was thrilled with the outcome. I left out the Italian dressing and cilantro, and we were out of tomatoes and lettuce so I did tweak it quite a bit but it ended up amazing. We will definitely be making this again!!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#4#13#We're not great fans of beans, so I put a small can of corn and a grated zucchini in the ground beef mixture instead. I didn't use the Italian dressing, and I used my own version of taco seasoning (with garlic powder, sweet smoked paprika, and ground cayenne pepper). I served lettuce, tomato and chopped onions, salsa, and plain yogurt on the side (makes it easier to reheat leftovers). We all really enjoyed it. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#18#6#I love Mexican food. This looked so good but tasted sooooo disappointing! I wondered about not adding an entire package of taco seasoning, should have went ahead and added the whole thing. The flour tortillas were a mistake too....just mush and blah. It really didn't taste like an enchilada casserole at all. It had potential but just a huge fail taste wise.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Fabulous and tasty. Easy to make. My kids wanted seconds. Followed the recipe.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Very easy and my husband and son loved it??
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#11#0#This was a hit at my house. I used corn tortillas that I fried. Didn't add the Italian dressing but did add 5 garlic cloves and 1 jalapeno to the hamburger while cooking. Just the right amount of heat for us. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Very quick to make and quite tasty! Thanks for a great recipe:)
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#This was simple and easy to fix, my whole family loved it. I will be making this a lot. Thanks for a great recipe.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#0#So easy and delicious. We like a bit of heat so I added red pepper flakes to the beef and onions and mixed in some pickled jalapenos slices to the finished mixture before baking to spice it up a bit. Will definitely make it again!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Super quick and easy family meal! Entire family loves this recipe and it's even great for leftovers! We prefer the flour tortillas it many have recommended corn if you're a fan! I did not add the sour cream as my son and his dad hate it, it still turned out fantastic! Definitely printing out a copy for my recipient books!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#0#Great recipe! Everyone loves it and it's easy to make. I've tried the recipe using flour tortillas and with corn tortillas. Both ways are good, but my family prefers it with the corn tortillas. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#What a great recipe! Came together quick and my whole family LOVED it!! Would be a very easy recipe to accommodate to your family's personal tastes! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#So good! Even my picky eaters loved it!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#0#Oh my goodness this was good. I didn't have any ground meat but I had leftover brisket and it was perfect!! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#3#1#Basically followed original recipe...however we preferred a bit more lettuce, tomato, etc. This is fun because you CAN make little adjustments to your family's liking and it is still AMAZING! Sorry, but even a little mushy I don't see how it would ruin the taste or make it gross. If it boiled over in your oven, and you used a 11 x7 Pyrex, it is because the recipe calls for an 11 x17 pan. Usually things boil over if your pan is too small OR your oven cooks too hot. My family thought it was great...I thought it was nutritious (hidden!), and we had fun all making it together. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#2#My husband and I didn't like it because of the flour tortillas. Should use corn tortillas. He thought bottom tortillas were hard from the baking. I had leftovers next day and the tortillas were mushy, pretty gross. Also, it bubbled over onto the bottom of my oven the last 5-10 minutes, uncovered, in an 11x7 Pyrex.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Oh so very good. The leftovers were even better. I highly recommend.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#0#Great recipe! My family loves things cheesy so I added more cheese and sour cream.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#1#I change out black beans for pinto beans and omitted the Clintro as we don't care for it. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#0#I added a diced bull pepper and a half can of rinsed corn and didn't use cumin or the dressing because of the other reviews where people said it didn't add to the flavor of the meal, it was awesome! I also used probably three cups of cheese and it was almost quesadilla like, very delicious and different for basically tacos or burritos, my five kids ate every bite!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Loved this recipe. Made it for my husband's poker buddies. They gobbled it up! I did use more sour cream than called for but that only made the dish more creamy. Used a little more Mexican blend cheese than called for. I did add the Italian dressing and didn't see that it altered the dish adversely. I will definitely make this dish again. Served shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, guacamole and extra salsa on the side. Also served a corn salad which was made ahead. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#I loved this recipe! The flavors are great. I made this exactly as stated and wouldn't change a thing! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#1#I have made this several times and it never disappoints. I generally buy the burrito size tortillas since one will fit nicely in the bottom of my round casserole dish. I then place half the burger mixture on it and layer it with one more tortilla and finish as directed. So easy and quick to make.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#1#I've made this twice. I think I used corn tortillas the first time and liked it better than with flour. I used about 1 1/2 cups of cheese instead of just 1 cup, and my family thought it needed more cheese. Next time I will use less cumin and will leave out the Italian dressing. Someone mentioned 3 layers of tortillas. I'm pretty sure it's just 2 layers. I placed 1 tortilla in the middle and tore the others to make them fit. I ended up only using 5 tortillas. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#2#This was a perfect recipe for my son to make who is learning to cook. He did it all himself following the well written directions. It really was a tasty dish, and the presentation was lovely. Son was quite proud of himself---even took a picture to email a friend! I told him he will have to fix it again for Cinco de Mayo! Thanks for sharing.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#2#0#I used corn tortillas instead of flour. Omitted the Italian dressing. I also added a can of refried beans and stirred the sour cream in meat/bean mixture.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#1#I made this for a neighborhood get-together, and it was a big hit. I will definitely make it again! I had 8 tortillas, so I made a third layer. I also had ground Elk, and used it instead of beef. It has very little fat. I used 2 cups of cheese. Thanks for sharing.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Wow! Quick and easy, and so good! I thought the Italian dressing was an odd addition, but I think it adds to the flavor. I did, however, leave out the black beans (picky kids.)
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Left out the Italian dressing. Used corn tortillas. Did not use enough. I only made one layer of torn tortillas. Next time I would use more. Since I suspected there weren't enough I sprayed tortillas and baked them the last 5 minutes of the casserole so we had chips. I added refried beans along with the black beans and stirred in Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I also used ground turkey instead of beef. We loved it. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Since it's the first time I made this, I followed directions exactly as written, made no modifications. It was good, but the Italian dressing clashed with the rest of the flavors and I didn't care for that bit. Will make again and omit dressing. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Great casserole! Everybody loves it. We typically make this dish for families with new babies or people who have had surgeries, etc. And we always get asked for the recipe. It's delicious! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Super easy to make, great taste. Family loved it!!!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Excellent dish! I've made it with (ground) beef, turkey, deer, and today I used elk. I also make Homemade Tortillas (another Taste of Home recipe) just to make it as healthy as possible. Thanks for sharing!!!! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#We LOVE this! I did lightly blend the salsa and onion because the kids don't like the texture, I mixed the sour cream together with the meat/bean mixture and used more cheese, about 2 cups. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Delish! Added retried beans, no Italian seasoning. Even my kids loved it. Will make again
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I completely forgot to put the Italian dressing in, however, it was great. Easy to make and we will definitely have it again.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Enjoyed this very much. I left out the Italian dressing (I just forgot it, I think), and used small corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas. I thought it came out a bit dry, so I might add more salsa or some enchilada sauce next time. The whole family scarfed it down!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Halved all ingredients and omitted Italian dressing. My husband and I loved it, one serving left that we will have to fight over.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#Favorite
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#We liked this, and I did leave out the Italian dressing becsuse I could not think of a reason for putting those flavors in a Tex Mex dish. Also used refreid beans and pepper jack cheese instead of the mexican blend.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Faimly and Friends loved it.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#1#0#I omit the Italian salad dressing. Extra salsa used. Used a can of refried beans as well as the black beans. Good chance to get the extra vegetables/fiber my family needs.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#WeweeWe
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#my kids love this recipe . It's a huge hit at our dinner table. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#We really liked this dish. I used corn tortillas instead of the flour. For the beef mixture, I used refried beans instead of the black beans, and also added green chiles and corn. I didn't have Mexican cheese, so I used sharp cheddar. This is a very versatile recipe, so using the suggestions of others worked well. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing this recipe! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Bottom layer hard to cut thru. Overall good flavor.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This had good flavor, but using flour tortillas made the layers too thick and hard to cut and eat. If I make it again, I will use corn tortillas.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This recipe tasted great! It was also really easy to make. I did use 2 cups of the cheese instead of 1 because it just didn't seem like enough, even though that added a lot more calories. Next time I might try saving the sour cream out and putting it on top. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Love this casserole. I add a layer of refried beans and jalapenos. Very good!!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was delicious and so quick and easy to make with simple ingredients. This is a keeper!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Use corn tortillas for a real enchilada texture. Flour tortillas get soggy.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My family loved it!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Excellent!!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I liked it but my husband and son did not. I think the three layers of tortillas made it hard to cut through and the leftovers were soggy.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Quick and delicious
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This is an excellent recipe. I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef and I used hot taco seasoning mix. My family loved it!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#i used a can of Mexican stewed tomatoes instead of salsa and added a can of corn and some diced jalapenos. It was delicious! New favorite!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#easy, like the ingredients, OK taste
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#New family favorite!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Excellent! I omitted the sour cream & Italian dressing because my husband isn't a fan of those foods. It still came out moist & tasty. This will certainly be a repeat dish. Jalapeno's would be a good addition for extra kick too. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My family and I really enjoyed this meal. It was easy to prepare and I will definitely serve it again.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#i take this to potlucks and everyone loves it . I use black bean and corn salsa. Just wonder how long to cook it in a crock pot?
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I didn't make any adjustments. I love it and friends and family love it just as it is. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Wonderful Delight!!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#A hit with the family! Hubby, I and 12 year old and 4 year old. Needs to be doubled as the four of us ate the entire dinner in one sitting with only one helping of leftovers left, which the children fought over for lunch the next day. Super simple to make, too!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Turned out really well. It is a wonderful dish.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#We really liked this recipe. Easy and delicious!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Delicious! I left out the dressing because I didn't have any. I took this to a ladies' dinner at church and didn't bring home a single bite! Everyone raved about it! I added a little salsa to the bottom and mixed the sour cream in the meat mixture as others recommended. Easy and delicious! I can't wait to make it again! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#EXCELLENT AND EASY TO MAKE! I thought the 400 degree oven temp excessive so I baked at 350 degrees for the specified time. Also spread a little salsa on bottom of casserole dish. No burning or crisp tortillas. This dish is definitely a keeper . Next time I will kick it up a little by adding some green chiles and/or chipotle chiles in adobe to mix. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Instead of the black beans, I used refriedBeans and layered each tortilla.Almost like a Mexican lasagna.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#!I have to tell you that the first time I made this was in Mexico. My Mexican friends loved it!!!Deveras. If you are finding the bottom too crisp then spread a little salsa in the bottom of your pan first. I always make it in a round casserole pan that accommodates the size of the tortillas I use. IF there is anything leftover, the taste is even better the next day for lunch. I serve with hot salsa on the side to accommodate all tastes
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#We liked it.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This is an awesome recipe. Quick and easy. Cilantro sets it off! Thanks!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Definitely went back for seconds!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Good recipe and easy to make. Next time, I will try throwing some jalapeños on top as well since we love spicy food.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#great recipe, wonderful flavor, going to try with ground turkey next time for fewer calories
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Good recipe, will make it again. Love the cilantro, and I also mashed half of the beans and added a little more sour cream.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Very good and tasty. Will be making this again soon!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Wonderful recipe....this is a keeper...will make this again and again.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I haven't made it for awhile but think I put a little salsa on the bottom of the pan to keep the tortillas moist.  I mashed up the black beans the 2nd time I made it so our youngest GS wouldn't find the beans.  He loves the casserole when the beans are mashed....wouldn't eat it the 1st time because he found a whole black bean & announced he'doesn't eat beans'. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I'm giving 4 stars only because my bottom tortilla got too crispy to cut which made it messy. I also substituted pintos for the black beans. Great flavor but may try cutting tortillas into strips as Ceannze mentioned. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Recipe was wonderful. Family loved and they are tough critics!!!!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Wonderful recipe, easy to make and something different!.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was the entree for tonight's dinner and it was well received! I left out the Italian dressing as I'm not a fan of it anyway, but it was excellent! I put the recipe in my favorite recipe box too. What do you think of tearing the tortillas in pieces instead of placing 3 down and 3 layered with the meat mixture? 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I just made this dish tonight and WOW....this is a keeper! Like others I also added the sour cream in the meat mixture.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Made this tonight and it was delicious. Very simple to make. Will be making again in the near future.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Great easy to make very good - love this recipe!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My family loves this recipe. I use ground turkey and add the sour cream to the mixture. I also add a can a corn. 5 stars!!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Super quick and easy and my family LOVES this recipe! I use ground turkey in stead of beef. The only other change I made was stirring the sour cream into the sauce mix after removing from heat. This recipe is a real keeper!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My family loves this recipe!!! I make this all the time. A real keeper!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I had ground beef I had to use last night and decided to make this for dinner. I usually don't have high hopes for casserole type dishes, but this turned out to be OUTSTANDING. My husband said it's one of the best things I've ever made. It's on the dinner rotation now. Thank you so much! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Loved it! Subbed pepper jack cheese for mexican blend. Super simple to throw together. A bit messy but who cares...it tastes great!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Very Good! I think I would double the tortillas though but over all it was great!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Love it and very easy to make.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Making this recipe again tonight and can't wait! It is SO easy and SO amazing!! LOVE IT 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Great flavor. We'll be adding fresh jalapeno to the toppings next time for a little more kick! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#1#My husband and I didn't like this recipe. It had an aftertaste that was unpleasant. I think from the Italian dressing. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Used turkey and only 4 tortillas. Wonderful!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Made this for dinner last night. Huge hit!! Actually made it for DH, I'm not a big fan of Mexican food and guess what, I went back for seconds!!! Awesome! Only thing I did different was added a can of chopped green chilies to the meat mixture. We like spicy. DH said next time he wanted guacamole with it. I agreed. Thanks for posting! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I made this for my oldest DS's family (kids from 3 to 7). I did make some changes - didn't have any taco seasoning or cumin - used 1 tsp. chili powder instead. And, used shredded Cheddar instead of red.-fat Mexican cheese blend. Nor did I use Cilantro. Of the 7 of us that ate it - 6 of us loved it & the 3 year old strongly objected to the black beans & refused to eat it. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I used corn tortillas and turkey. Top with guacamole. R new family favorite. Quick, Easy & Healthy
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Very tasty recipe. I love the southwestern taste so what's not to love about this recipe. Made as written with the exception I did not have any fresh cilantro so I used dried. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This is easy and my husband said it is very good. I will definitely make it again.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My kids loved this! I added the sour cream to the meat mixture to save time and to make sure the sour cream was evenly distributed.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Everyone in our family loves this recipe and it has been become a regular for us. I have made is per the recipe and also made a version where I changed the sour cream for Non-fat plain greek yogurt and it tastes the same. LOVE this!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I added rotel tomatoes and salsa so I think that made it too runny. Good flavor but it was a like a dip instead of a Mexican layered dish.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I made this according to the recipe and we all loved it. However, the tortillas wouldn't fit in a 2 quart casserole so I used a 9 x 13. The next time I think I'll try corn tortillas as we like that flavor in our Mexican meals. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I have made this many times for all types of people & I have never had anyone not love it. It's a regular part of of the menu when my husband & I cook Mexican for corporate events, & my husband IS Mexican! It is my teenage daughter's top request. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was AWESOME!!!!!! Will definitely make again.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was so tasty that we ate it until all of the leftovers were gone!! I tried it with the cilantro for the first night but it was too overpowering so left it and the italian dressing off and it was sooo tasty!! Making it again tonight!!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Was impressed with this dish. We have added it to our list of keepers ! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#As soon as I saw this on the cover of the magazine, I knew I was going to try this. My whole family loved it. It is also very easy to make. I have made it several times. Always make as written.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was a winner with my family...everyone loved it. I didn't include the Italian dressing just because I didn't have any on hand. Still very good. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was excellent and so easy... would make it for company or potluck!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My family really liked it. For a 4 and a 5 year old it was perfect!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I've made this twice. The first time I added the Italian dressing and it was terrible! Tonight I omitted the dressing and although it was much better, it was missing a little kick. Next time, I'll try hot salsa to see if that helps. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I had decided to try this meal out since there were a considerable amount of good ratings, and boy am I glad I did! It is delicious! My family scarfed it down, there were no leftovers, and the price was descent. Definitely will be added to our family favorites list. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#AMAZING!!!! My family loved it! I have forwarded this recipe on the about 10 other people as well! Definitely a keeper and will be making this alot! Thanks for sharing!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was so good, everyone at the table was making yummy noises! Adults, kids and toddlers all gobbled it up and went back for seconds- I didn't have any leftovers! Will make this again for sure! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This is a wonderful recipe! I do substitute corn tortillas instead of flour, but that is just our preference. I love that this is a healthier version of other enchilada recipes I have. Everyone in our family loves it!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Yummy...easy. Perfect as is
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I made this exactly as is written with the exception of the taco seasoning. I used a Fiesta Dip mix (1 T, not 2 as directed) from Tastefully Simple. Otherwise exactly as written and this is amazing. My grown children were home fro supper and want the recipe and took the leftover home with them. Served a salad in a small tortilla shell baked into a bowl and some spanish rice. Beautiful dinner, good enough to be served to anyone!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#So yummy!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Great Recipe...Made for group spread at work!!! Co Workers enjoyed it...Very Easy and you can do alot w/ it!  Added everything but Italian Dressing, however I did also add refried beans (spreaded on tortillas)  Added olives adn jalapenos on top!  GREAT
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This is a great recipe! My husband loves having this for dinner. My only change was leaving out the Italian dressing - I did not have any on hand.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Dont pay attention to any bad review of this recipe. It is yummy and quick to make. Mine looked just like the pic above:) It was delicious!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Cubbybear - thanks for the recipe....just about everyone was raving about it & I just couldn't find it or access the link. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Cubbybear - thanks for posting the link but when I click on it....I get a'page cannot be displayed' message.  I've tried several times - same message.  
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I made this with the flour tortillas and they were soggy, slimy and did not taste good. We ended up dishing out the filling (which was good) and not eating the tortillas at all. If I were to make this again, I would use tortilla chips instead. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Tried this tonight and really enjoyed it. My husband loved it! I'm a little hard to please but I followed the recipe exactly (except I added a layer of salsa to the bottom before I put down the torillas to prevent the dryness everyone was talking about as well as leaving out the onion because I don't like onion and felt the salsa would have plenty) and it turned out delicious. It went together so easily and I will definitely make this again. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I tried a recipe search for Enchilada Casser-Ole....couldn't find it.  Also went thru several pages of the thread - what's the recipe?  Thank you. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Excellent dish and so easy! modifications: I used corn tortillas, covered bottom of casserole w/salsa, used kidney beans,mixed sour cream into meat mixture but also added cream cheese since I didn't have enough sour cream. The results? No left overs! Three teens and a picky 11year old all devoured it. My youngest doesn't even like casseroles, Mexican and beans; however, she loved this dish. Will make this a family recipe keeper! Thank you! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My whole family loved this!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I've recommended this to several friends and colleagues, and made it for my family many time.... EVERYONE LOVES IT!!! This deserves more than five stars! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My husband did not like this and I would use corn tortillas instead of flour.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Very yummy! I did not use the dressing and subbed out the sour cream for cottage cheese. I used the sour cream for a topper instead. Will definately be making this one again!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I make this often for new moms who just had babies. It's a nice change from the usual fare for them. Warning--this can be pretty spicy so I have toned it down esp for nursing moms by using mild taco seasoning and mild salsa. :o) It's always a hit. And it's easy too! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I thought the flavor was good but it didn't end up looking like the picture. The next time I make it I will add more layers of tortillas so it has more consistency. Overall, a good, filling meal. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Even my very picky 6yr old son liked it!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This recipe is amazing and I will definitly be making it again. My kids liked it, too, but it was a little spicy for them, so I think I would lessen the taco seasoning next time. I also think it looks funky with the sour cream baked in it, so I think I would leave that for a topping after it is done.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My husband and I loved this recipe. The only thing I changed was using corn torillas instead of flour. Very very good.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Fantastic! I used nonfat plain Greek yogurt. Very YUMMY! Kids love this.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My husband absolutely loved this!!! It's so easy and has wonderful flavor. Plus, it serves so many or leaves lots of leftovers :) 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My family LOVED this! I did make some changes and additions... Instead of salsa, I used Rotel, instead of flour tortillas, I used tortilla chips and I also added refried beans. This was fantastic and a definite keeper! Thanks!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#We didn't know what to make for dinner last night and discovered we had all the ingredients for this so we tried it. It was a little too spicy for our 8 y/o, but still a definite keeper . This may be my husband's new favorite diabetic friendly recipe! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Family loved this and have requested it again! Very easy and yummy!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was FANTASTIC! EVERYONE (that's me, my husband, and 5 picky kids) ALL loved it! It was easy to make and came together quickly. I did add sliced olives to the lettuce topping, and I used regular cheddar cheese. Other than that, I followed the directions exactly and it was GREAT! Thanks for a great recipe! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was very good and hubby agreed! I'm making it again next week. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This recipe is really good. I changed it up a bit. I used ground Venison and made my own Italian dressing. I also doubled the recipe and used one can of black beans and one can of refried beans. I disagree with most of the people on here about this recipe being fast and easy. I started it at 5 and by the time I was done with all the chopping it was 7. Definitely a weekend meal.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#1#Next time I'll leave out the Italian dressing - it gave it a sweetness that I felt was out of place. And I'll use more beef and less onion. Between the salsa and the whole onion... it was just about too much. but in general, a good recipe! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was delicious! My husband loved it. I didn't have black beans, so I used kidney beans which were very tasty. Would definitely make this again! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Easy enough to do and very tasty!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My husband hates casseroles (or so he thinks), but I had to try this recipe because to me it sounded wonderful. He absolutely loved it. It's been less than a week and he's wanting to know when I'm preparing it again! My only differences from the recipe--I only keep whole grain tortillas on hand, but they worked great. And I forgot to pick up fresh tomatoes, so topped it with salsa. And for anyone considering leaving off the lettuce--DON'T! Some crisp shredded romaine topped it off perfectly!! My husband ate 3 of the 8 servings that night at dinner. Perfect recipe!!! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Great and super easy recipe. We are going to try it with shredded cooked chicken next time. Thanks for sharing!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Awesome meal, will definitely make it again. The only thing I did differently was use burrito seasoning instead of taco.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This recipe is a family favorite. Even my picky 17yr old nephew loves it. I have made it several times. The Italain dressing is a great addition. There are never any leftovers. It is also quick and easy.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My picky eater devoured this casserole. He complained about being too full! It is on my list of make agains. It is very easy!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Love it!! Yummy and easy to put together. The tortillas are the first part of the layer, in aswering dvilands question. What tortillas is your preference. I myself dont care for corn tortillas at all and use flour, wheat tortillas are good to.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My husband and I loved this easy and hearty casserole.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#The entire family loved this..It is AWESOME..will be making again very soon
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I find this recipe confusing. The instructions call for 3 tortillas, but they are not listed in the ingredients. Are the tortillas all added to the bottom of the casserole, or are they layered with the filling between? The photo looks like there are two layers of tortillas. I have not made the recipe but would like to try it.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Everyone I serve this to loves it.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#It was horrible. The Italian dressing does not belong in a Mexican casserole. It overpowered all the other flavors. Even the dogs wouldn't eat it! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I have not made this yet but I do not understand why recipes for enchilladas use flour tortillas. Corn tortillas have so much more flavor and texture! I will try it with corn tortillas.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This recipe is one of my family's favorites! Wheat tortillas work great too and make the dish even healthier. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#the family loved it. Will make again.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was a tasty meal and my family enjoyed it. The only thing I didn't like was the tortillas that were on the greased edge of the pan got hard and basically inedible but overall it was a good meal. I think the mixture would also be good inside a burrito! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#very good, everyone liked it
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My husband and I love this dish, it's not to hard to make and I follow the instructions as is except that I call it Mexican pizza instead. I cut it out like pizza slices and the taste is amazing! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was a quick and easy recipe, and it was deliscious. We will definitely make this one again.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was fabulous! My family gobbled it up so quickly. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This is easy to prepare and very tasty.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was great, my kids loved too!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Super easy and tastes incredible!! I will be making this dish often!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I add green chilies and mash 1/2 of the black beans and leave the rest whole. I also use corn tortillas and fry them in olive oil before layering to add texture to the dish.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My husband and I love this recipe. Easy to make and very tasty!
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Very tasty. I added corn and some ranch dressing.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#switched the beef out for ground turkey - it was amazing.
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I am vegetarian and made this with textured vegetable protein. It turned out great and was delicious! The husband ate it and until I told him there was no meat in it, he didn't even realize. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Okay...this wasn't my favorite recipe ever, but it satisfied a major Mexican food craving tonight. I made it with corn tortillas, and the flavor was good. Worth making. I think I'd prefer even a bit more cheese next time. Gooey is good. 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Great flavor and easy to make. My whole family loves it.....
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Quick and easy! Makes for a wonderful weeknight dinner when you have kids with sporting events or other things going on! I also like to add green chiles to spice it up a bit!

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I really thought this was going to be better based on all the other reviews. Maybe it was the kind of black beans I used or the type of Italian dressing, but my family didn't love it. I may try this one again just because I love anything with tomatoes or cilantro.

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I've made this twice now, and will be making it again and again! I use soft corn tortillas for a more authentic enchilada flavor and double the cheese. The contrast of the cool lettuce, tomato, and cilantro topping is fantastic. Be sure to use a very sharp knife to cut the casserole, as the bottom layer of tortillas can be a bit of a challenge to cut neatly.

I may try to subsitute ground turkey and cut out one tortilla per layer to cut down the fat a little so it works into my diet more easily! I highly recommend.

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Loved this recipe! Even though I found it in the Comfort Food Diet magazine, it still seemed a little heavy. I made some substitutions. I used 93% lean ground turkey instead of 90% ground beef + used the entire 1.25 lb package instead of the 1 lb of ground beef called for in the recipe since I didn't want to freeze the extra 1/4 lb by itself. I don't like Italian dressing so used 1/3 cup v-8 juice instead of ¼ c It dressing. Next time I will boost it to 1/2 or 2/3 c if I use the extra gr. turkey again. Cut the number of flour tortillas to 2 per layer instead of 3. Results in 8 WW points plus for 8 servings.

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Oh my goodness this is so good and super easy! The change I did make was not in ingredient but in preparation. I mixed the salsa and sourcream together which made it much easier to layer than sourcream by itself. Will definitely make again!

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was pretty good. I do have one complaint though. The bottom tortilla's were hard. I think next time I am going to put a really thin layer of salsa or something at the bottom so the shells will not be rock.

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This is a very good recipe, my husband loved it!!!! It was a little too spicy for me so I think I will use a milder salsa next time. Couldn't tell the difference with the Italian dressing in it at all but will use it again. I did use regular sour cream and cheese instead of lite.

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I love Mexican dishes, and it is often difficult to find ones that my wife will tolerate. The cilantro and the subtle flavor of the dressing made this a meal that she will most likely let me make again. A dollop of sour cream would have probably made it even better.

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Sorry, but I didn't use any fat free stuff. Browned beef and onion, drained. Added 1 packet taco season, cumin, salsa, salad dressing and kidney beans (we don't like black beans). Heated in skillet and served meat mixture over crushed tortilla chips. Added cheese, lettuce, tomatoe, raw onion and sour cream on top of each serving. Great recipe! We had to force ourselves to stop eating!

Added 1 packet taco season, cumin, salsa, salad dressing and kidney beans (we don't like black beans). Heated in skillet and served meat mixture over crushed tortilla chips. Added cheese, lettuce, tomatoe, raw onion and sour cream on top of each serving. Great recipe! We had to force ourselves to stop eating! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I was so looking forward to trying this recipe, but I must've done something wrong. It did not turn out at all, and there were definitely no distinct layers, as shown in the photo. I'm not sure what happened.

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Loved it! I used 1/2 chunky mango habanero salsa, and 1/2 standard hot, and the texture was great, not runny at all. I usually make my own taco seasoning, and just mixed in some chile powder, cumin, oregano, cayenne, salt/pepper, and fresh garlic. I also added minced serrano pepper. I did make a couple minor substitutions: shallots instead of onion, and monterey jack instead of mexican cheese. The only problem was I ate way too much. I think next time I'll try corn tortillas and maybe add a can of corn.

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#i made this recipe for a group of friends, although i did exclude the italian dressing and 1 cup of the salsa, but it was a very big hit. i made one casserole with lean ground beef and one with chicken i shredded, and was suprised to find the chicken went over better! (with all the exact same ingredients) It also cut very well after cooling with the excluded ingredients, not messy or sloppy at all! :)

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Okay...this wasn't my favorite recipe ever, but it satisfied a major Mexican food craving tonight. I made it with corn tortillas, and the flavor was good. Worth making. I think I'd prefer even a bit more cheese next time. Gooey is good.

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was very good but a little runny. Maybe if I drained the salsa it would have been thicker. Also would swap out flour tortillas to corn.

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Not sure if anyone else commented on this but the meat mixture makes an AWESOME CHIP DIP! This is our second time having this. I made it with 1.5lbs of ground beef, skipped the onion b/c we use chunky salsa, added half a bag of sweet corn (for crunch), mixed in the sour cream and used a whole pkg of taco seasoning. I was so hungry that I had a taste on a tortilla chip and we actually ate it like that for dinner! Put some in a bowl, topped with shredded cheese and voila! As my 4yo says, !Delicioso! 
Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I made this recipe using tortilla chips instead of the flour tortillas. It was delicious! I will definitely make it again.

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Made this over the weekend for my hubby. He usually won't try new things but he LOVED this and so did I. It was really easy to make and very delicious, re-heats well too. Next time I'm going to chop up some jalapenos and add to the mixture to give it more spice.

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Very good! My whole family loved it and told me repeatedly that I will need to make this again. I did put 3/4 c of the salsa on the bottom of the pan as was suggested and I also stirred in the sour cream with the meat and beans. I loved how easy it was to serve (not having to add salsa or sour cream on the plate).

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Great dish. I made a few personal changes (used ground turkey, full taco pack, whole wheat tortillas) but still wonderful. My husband loved it. I also used the meat mixture for tacos one night, and used the remainder to make a smaller casserole for another evening.

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#My husband absolutely loved this! He usually doesn't say things are good until I ask him what he thinks. This time, he took one bite and said it was really good! I did what some of the other people did, I put some salsa on the bottom of a 9x13 pan. Instead of layering the sour cream I added it into the meat mixture. Much easier to spread around!

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was a delicious, filling meal!! I absolutely loved it. I did follow some previous comments of putting some salsa on the bottom to prevent sticking. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream as I had that in the fridge and mixed it in with the beans and meat. Thank you for the recipe!

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Very yummy. My 2 picky eaters (husband & 5yr old) both enjoyed it which makes me happy. Very easy to make. I forgot to cover it when I baked it but it still turned out awesome. Since I like a little more spice to my food I added some hot sauce to my serving, but wouldn't add it to the entire dish...again, I have picky eaters.

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Just made this again & WoW it is fantastic! I did some modifications this time to try some new things out. This recipe is great as is but the additions were nice & changed it up a little. I added 1 C. frozen corn to the meat/onions in the pan. I added 4 cloves garlic chopped to the pan towards the end of cooking. I used 2 C. Tostitos Mild Chunky Salsa (used a small amount to coat bottom of baking dish to prevent sticking which worked great). I used 2 cans black beans. Used 1 C. lite sour cream which I added to the meat mixture once it was done instead of using it as a layer. I used 1/2 C. Zesty Italian dressing (Kraft). Used 8 flour tortillas instead of 6 & put it all in a 9X13 baking pan. I used 8 oz. authenic mexican cheese blend already pre-shredded & more cilantro because we love it! This is again AMAZING & would be great for any family meal or potluck. I would precut it for a potluck though. Cut with sharp knife first otherwise it will fall apart. Fantastic!!

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Wow, that was incredible! My kids absolutely loved it! It was all gone in a flash! I used a little bit of salsa to put on the bottom of the dish to prevent the bottom tortillas from getting too hard like some reviews had said. It worked fantastic. Just a small layer to coat/cover dish. Also I mixed the sour cream in the meat/bean mixture instead of layering it because my kids don't like sour cream unless it is mixed in things. They loved it! We used Tostitos mild chunky salsa & Kraft zesty Italian dressing. This is a family favorite now!!

I made some changes to the recipe, used ground turkey, used 1 cup of salsa and 1 can of rotei diced tomatoes with green chilies. Didn't add the sour cream in(kids are not fans of sour cream), but I added on top with the lettuce and tomatoes for myself. Great Dish!!

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This is a great recipe for all ages! The only change I made was to use an 8 oz bottle of mild picante sauce instead of the salsa. (My kids don't like the chunks ) I spread a little sauce on the bottom of the pan before placing the tortillas. This prevented sticking and hardness mentioned by others, and also kept the casserole from being runny. I will definitely make again!

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This recipe hit the spot! We were in the mood for mexican food but didn't want to make tacos, so I tried this. It turned out great. The tortillas weren't hard at the bottom, and it had just the right mix of cumin and italian dressing. Really great flavors. Even my 1 year old liked it and I wasn't sure if he would because it's pretty spicy!

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Very tasty, but the bottom tortilla was very hard. I let it sit for 10 minutes before we cut it and it still oozed all over the place. Did not turn out well....maybe my salsa was too watery, I'm not sure, but we couldn't even save it for leftovers; it was too runny.

I thought it was very, very good and would deffinately make it again! Even better hours after baking.

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#I have been making this for years. I have learned to just mix the hamb, sour cream, salsa, black beans and zesty italian dressing together. Then layer with flour or corn shells and cheese. I make this on the weekend and cover with foil to bake during the week when I don't have time to cook. My boys who are picky eaters love it. We call it mexican lasagna. Oh, I also use up my green onions and cilantro if I have on hand.

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#This was so good, and even great heated up the next day for leftovers! I didn't go the low-fat, reduced sodium way and added a bit more sour cream. One addition I made was to mash up an avocado and spread it on the first layer of sour cream before the second layer of ingredients. Quick & easy so I am sure it will become a regular at our house. I let it set about 10 - 15 minutes before cutting it and the pieces came out perfectly!

I cut the onions in half and used ground turkey instead, it tasted fantastic. For the other reviewers who said theirs was soupy/runny... make sure to drain the black beans before adding. Also, the type of salsa will make a difference too. I used a thick and chunky type. Very yummy!

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#Loved it! However, I did what several other reviewers suggested and used corn tortillas instead. To keep the tortillas soft versus grainy , I cooked them in a little canola oil for about 15 seconds each and drained on paper towels. (I know this totally added to the calories, but we don't like the flour tortillas because they become soggy) I did use more cheese - probably closer to 2 cups (jalapeño jack and cheddar). Other than the extra cheese and corn tortillas, I followed the recipe exactly as written. I have to say that I always viewed lettuce and tomatoes on these types of casseroles as optional & pretty garnish , but it is a must for this casserole! Almost tastes like a taco salad. Thanks so much for the recipe; I was REALLY tired of making the same old ones I've been making forever!Karla

Thanks so much for the recipe; I was REALLY tired of making the same old ones I've been making forever! Karla

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#0#As soon as I saw this on the cover I knew I had to try it. Wow, so simple yet so delicious. I added some extra heat with a few shakes of Tabasco because my salsa was mild.

Enchilada Casser-Ole!#0#1#I made this for supper tonight with a few modifications. I used lean ground turkey instead of beef. I didn't have any Italian dressing so I used Catalina. Other than that I followed the recipe. We had our salad as a starter instead of on top of the casserole. It made for a very satisfying dinner. My husband loved it. Mine didn't look like the picture tho'-it was quite runny even after sitting the five minutes, but I will definitely be making it again.

Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Signed up just to review. Very easy to make even for folks like myself with limited cooking ability. Whole familly loved it and asked to make it again.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#0#My DH absolutely loves this. The first time I made it as written and he was smitten ;) I've tried multiple variations, with italian sausage and pizza sauce, with taco meat and salsa, with pepperoni on top, and he always wants me to go back to the original! So...I have a pan of the original in the oven right now! Thank you for a great recipe! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#1#Pretty good. Nothing fancy, but certainly tasty. I think next time I'd go a little lighter on the cheese, add some extra zucchini/squash, and play around with some spices or a little more imaginative of a sauce. Also, I'm having difficulty understanding where the similarity to Pizza is imagined to be. All that said, I liked it. Plus, as a concept (i.e. Squash/egg/cheese based) it's a great way to use up the tons of summer squash from the garden. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#3#0#Just made this the other day and it was a big hit! I like that the zucchini is baked as a crust before adding the rest.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#3#0#And once again, I forgot to put in my stars. This is a 5 star recipe all the way!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#0#My daughter, who absolutely HATES zucchini, loves this recipe. She says I should make it once a week! LOL!!!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#5#1#This recipe was really good. The only substitution I made was using ground venison.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#2#10#We need a good substitute for the eggs! Thanks
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#11#2#Excellent! The only thing I added was Italian seasoning when I cooked the Italian sausage.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#12#0#We recently made a switch to lower carb eating. This was really good, and anyone who knows me knows how much I intensely dislike zucchini! I spite of that, I made and enjoyed this dish, and will definitely make it again.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#7#0#I'm always looking for ways to hide the texture of ground beef, and tried this, we really liked it and I'll make it again--especially since I have about 30+ yellow zucchini sitting around and no freezer room! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#18#9#We thought this was great. I did change a few things though. I used the suggested Italian sausage ILO ground beef. I also used pizza sauce ILO the tomato sauce. We like green olives and mushrooms on pizza, so I added those to the Italian sausage mixture. It was wondereful!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#6#0#Scrumptious! What a great way to use up zucchini from my garden. I plan on making this recipe again and again. Thank you for this fantastic recipe!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#13#4#This is excellent...a BIG hit! I did use Paesana New York Classic Pizza Sauce instead of tomato sauce because it's my favorite (I just eyeballed how much I used.) I also used sausage instead of hamburger and added pepperoni because I love it. I'm thinking of just baking and freezing the zucchini crust, then adding the topping when I'm ready to make it. I have so MANY zucchinis. I figure I can store those easier in the freezer than the whole casserole...because we will be eating this a lot, I can tell:) 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#8#4#Winner of a recipe, perfect for the summer garden abundance. I did not have ground burger, so used pork sausage and it was great. And, I confess to using pasta sauce for the tomato sauce as I had a half jar in the fridge. But, this was super tasty and will go into my files for the future
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#6#0#Got great reviews from the family on this, was told to double it next time. I did put a layer of pepperoni on the zucchini crust before the sauce mixture.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#15#11#I think this sounds good but the pizza influence is not there, namely the seasonings in real pizza sauce. Basil, oregano. Garlic, salt and black pepper. A can of paste added to the sauce. Simmer until it bubbles like the old mud pots at Disneyland. Top the zucchini layer with sauce, top with hamburger, veg and cheese and that should bring this home. I've been making pizza for 50 years, trust me this works. Otherwise it's a great recipe and the zucchini rocks! Love keto.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#3#12#I did not have regular zucchini, but used a green squash, shredded. I did use more Mozzarella and Cheddar cheese (2 cups each), 15-oz. of pizza sauce, 3/4 of a regular onion, chopped, 1.9 lb. ground beef, 1 chopped green pepper. The regular Parmesan cheese and eggs were kept as recipe stated. I used a smaller baking dish (11x7 ). The size worked out great! This is a great recipe! (I didn't have Italian-style tomato sauce on hand!) 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#10#1#This was excellent, and my picky kids loved it! They asked me where the zucchini was as they couldn't even taste it. I added pepperoni to ours since my family loves pepperoni. This recipe is a keeper and was a great way to use up all that garden zucchini. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#4#13#What a great idea to use zucchini! I made several changes to our liking. I fried the beef up with an entire fennel bulb. Instead of sauce, I poured sundried tomatoes over the zuke mixture. Then some canned olives, green chilies. I also didn't measure cheese, I'm sure it was one half more. Took it out of the oven after 20 minutes. Topped with fresh basil and sliced mozzarella and broiled until bubbling. YUM! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#3#5#We really enjoyed this! I did make some changes though. I used ground chicken, and I used a half a jar of marinara sauce I had leftover instead of plain tomatoes. I also added pepperoni on top of half (left the other half with just the peppers). Even the kids ate it! I'll definitely be making this again. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#9#2#This was awesome! I made a few tweaks of course :) I baked the crust at 500 for 15 minutes and then did a low broil for 3-4 minutes before adding the topping, just to crisp it up. I also added turkey pepperoni to half of the top because my hub loves it. This is exactly what we were looking for in terms of low carb pizza night. Thank you! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#10#3#Ate this casserole at a church potluck and had to get the recipe. I couldn't find Italian tomato sauce at my grocery so I just got regular tomato sauce and added some Italian seasonings. You can also use spaghetti sauce, too instead of the tomato sauce!!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#2#0#Made this tonight. It was wonderful. I will be making it again as it has made the monthly rotation list in our house.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#6#3#My sister told me she made this and how much she liked it. Since this is perfect for a diet I just started I thought I'd try it myself. Well, I must say, this is ONE delicious casserole! The zucchini crust is so cheesy and delicious... it could be a side dish on it's own! The hamburger topping just finishes it off perfectly. The only thing I did different was to use a jar of pizza sauce instead of Italian tomato sauce and I used a tablespoon of dried onion flakes instead of chopped onion. This is a very good recipe... on my meal rotation now. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Wow! If I didn't know, I would not have known that it was a zucchini base. What a great way to use zucchini. I used my home canned marinara sauce and it was absolutely delicious. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#3#5#This was so good! Unfortunately, I can't leave well enough alone :( Had to add pepperoni and olives on top when the grandkids were here - used shredded chicken, bacon and alfredo sauce in (2) 8x8's for work. Endless possibilities for an wonderful base!! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#2#0#This is delicious! Great use of the abundant crop of zucchini from our garden. Low carb too!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#4#0#I thought this was an awesome recipe, interesting and quite tasty. I did increase the meat to 1 1/2 pounds, and used a marinara sauce. Thanks for sharing.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#2#1#This was good, and I only used half the ground beef (but doubled the onions).
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#2#2#I can't wait to try this. Love zucchini and pizza. This was good. I think I'll use stewed tomatoes next time for more flavor. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#1#My family's favorite! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#4#0#Just did a review; forgot to add that no salt added marinara sauces are available; I use Trader Joe's organic one. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#2#0#Great recipe! My son asked if I could make again. Everyone enjoyed it.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#4#1#WOW. I am so so impressed with this recipe!! It tastes like perfection, which is an understatement. I cannot wait to make this again. Thank you so much for an awesome recipe!!!!!!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#2#0#My family really enjoyed this recipe. I did use pizza sauce as others suggested and added Italian spices. It served closer to 4 people. Will make again!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#2#0#This is a creative and delicious recipe with many options. I made the recipe as listed with a few minor changes: I added pepper to the crust mixture, substituted turkey, and used a red bell pepper as I find it milder for young palates. This will be a regular in my rotation. Our ten-month-old grand daughter ate three large servings!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#1#Great recipe. I used pizza sauce (Prego) as recommended by other reviewers. I also added 1/2 teaspoon pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pizza seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon basil, 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon frozen pizza seasoning, and 1/2 t. garlic powder. Everyone loved it - including the 2 and 8 year old grandchildren.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Excited by this simple yet tasty gluten-free recipe!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#3#0#This recipe is great! I like to add mushrooms to the sauce and top with black olives...yum!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#2#1#Excellent recipe - didn't change a thing. I'll be making it again. Delicious. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#It is like a pizza without a bread crust. Good recipe for a gluten free diet. Very tasty.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Excellent! Kids had seconds!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#0#My family loved this but I did make changes. I used bulk Italian sausage instead of ground beef and pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce. I don't think it would have tasted like pizza otherwise. The crust had to be baked longer than recommended and the zucchini needed more time in the colander to draw out the moisture. Knowing this now and making those changes I will be making it again. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#0#Great recipe and really easy to make hotdish. (Can't believe anyone from Minnesota would call it a casserole) 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#0#I made this with the veggies from my garden. It was so tasty that I will definitely make it again. I found that it did not feed eight, unless you have several sides or a giant salad. The reason I like casseroles so much is so I don't have to make sides ;-). I feel to have it as a stand alone meal, that the more appropriate servings listed would be 5 or 6. Next time I make it (which i will for sure), I will double the recipe if I intend to feed more than 4. Loved it! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#2#Love Love Love the zucchini crust. I've made the recipe several times, similar to as written, I substituted pizza sauce. Also, I take the grated zucchini and place on a clean dishtowel and wring out the moisture, no salt no colander. This last time, I made it like a real pizza. DELICIOUS 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This recipe finally got my husband to eat zucchini! Not only that, he's been requesting it at least once a week since I discovered it on your site a few months ago. Getting the zucchini dry enough to crisp up was a challenge, but we started using a hand-held ricer to squeeze out small batches after shredding it in the food processor to save time. It makes a huge difference, and I find that using a stoneware bar pan is a big help as well. I toss in a handful of italian seasonings to give the crust a little more flavor, and have made this with a variety of meats in the sauce (ground chicken, turkey, beef . . . even elk!) and it has come out fantastic every time. It only gets better the longer you let it cook! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This is a go to dish for me every summer especially with a garden full of fresh zucchini! There is lots of flexibility with this recipe and you can add garlic to the ground beef and onion mixture and add in some Italian seasoning to the sauce mixture. I have done it both ways and our family loves it including my 11 year old son!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#1#Did not like at all
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#0#I followed the recipe and it was wonderful! My son's dad even liked it ! And he doesn't eat anything green! Need to dry the zucchini more but this is a keeper!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#1#Used ground turkey instead of ground beef and added Italian spices to the meat and the zucchini mix. Everyone loved it
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was pretty good. A great way to use up Zucchini as there is always an abundance this time of year. I did use Italian sausage because that is what I had on hand. I'll definitely make again but think I will bake the zucchini crust a little longer so that it gets a little crispy. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#5#I don't understand the high ratings. This would have been flavorless had I not added extra seasoning. Hard to believe this won any contest.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was really good.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#2#0#This is our favorite main dish zucchini recipe! Just top it with whatever your favorite pizza toppings are if you want more flavor than the ground beef. I usually use the ground beef, onion, tomato sauce layer then might add some pepperoni, olives, sausage, additional onion, mushrooms......whatever I want on my pizza. Love it, love the results, not watery at all.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I knew from reading this recipe that it would be tasty. I am usually one of those review readers who does eye rolls when reading that the reviewer followed the recipe except for...then lists a long list of modifications. Well, I made some changes, too, and the outcome was great. I followed the process instructions as written. I used sweet Italian sausage instead of ground beef as I wanted a little zippier flavor, more pizza-like. I also added 1 tsp. of minced garlic after the sausage-onion mixture was browned (who doesn't like a little garlic in pizza?) My grocery store did not have Italian tomato sauce so I used regular and added 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning. Since the recipe called for either red or green pepper, I used half of a red pepper and half of a green pepper, giving the dish a colorful look. My husband was a bit skeptical until the first bite--then he was a convert. He raved about it and I do have to say, it was delicious. I had split the mixture into two casseroles with the idea of bake-one-freeze-one. I'll have to see how that goes next time I make it because we've plowed right into the next casserole the next night; leftovers were as delicious as the first night. I have strict instructions to make this dish again. ;) 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#2#1#Made this last night for a potluck today. Everyone loved it-I work with lots of people on Keto and I was really glad to find something they could eat without needing to change anything! Just make sure you get the excess moisture out of the Zucchini, I layer mine on a cookie sheet and dried it out a bit (400 for 10 min) before I cooled and combined it with the egg and cheese) and you can get it firm without being too dry! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#0#This is tasty. I sliced my zucchini very thin instead of shredding it. I mixed it with the eggs, parm cheese, and half the other cheeses but didn't bake it until I added the remaining ingredients as listed. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#1#A great way to use zucchini! Really good tasting. But our first question was, Where is the crust? The casserole baked up nicely and looked good, but we couldn't find a crust! My family said I should add noodles. I might add more flour. I added cut up ham and black olives instead of the hamburger and peppers. Yummy flavor. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Excellent! Hubby had 3 helpings! The only addition I made was 1 tsp Italian seasoning. Next time I'll try sausage, garlic
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Lynn's recipe was fantastic! My whole family loved a new dish, which I feel doesn't happen that often :) I forgot the red or green pepper, but it still tasted great. I added a little drizzle of olive oil to the zucchini part just before layering on the meat sauce. Really really delish--and easy. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This is my favorite pizza recipe. I don't do bread and this smells so pizza awesome, I can't get enough! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Love this. I'drain' zucc by spreading out large kitchen towel or two, cover with a couple layers of paper towel, then AFTER I've pushed all the liquid I can out through the colander, I spread the zucc on the towel layers and roll it up - TIGHT. May take a couple times, but it really does the trick and then your crust will be crisper. Also, my grandsons think pepperoni is a food group so we don't use beef or sausage - just spread pizza sauce over crust, put a think layer of pepperoni on this, then your cheeses and veggies. Sometimes bacon with the pepperoni (WHY NOT?!?!) After it's done everyone puts their own toppings on as desired. They love to help make it, too, so are happy to eat it :) 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#So easy to adapt to your tastes / groceries on hand. Tonight, I swapped the quantites of cheddar and mozzarella, and added a 2.5oz bag of bacon bits to the meat mixture for bacon cheeseburger pizza. Hubby took one bite and announced, it's a keeper. I plan to try a version with Mexi-blend cheese, and taco seasoning in the meat, maybe salsa or taco sauce instead of tomato sauce. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Delicious! The kids will love it. Healthy
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Great recipe! I use half ground beef and half hot Italian sausage.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#0#Very good BUT ADD TO YOUR NOTES ,ABOUT CRUST : Z ucchini MUST BE squeezed VERY WELL...using SEVERAL double layers of paper towels, and repeat several times...Even after draining. Then crust should be kinda thin ISH BUT EVEN everywhere in pan. Or thicker parts do not crisp up well. THEN be sure to COOL crust completely, so that meat 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#6#https://pakrealestatenews.wordpress.com/2019/08/08/dha-defence-islamabad/
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I cooked the pepper in with the hamburger, because we don't like ours crunchy. It was very good. We also did add a little more salt and some pepper. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#2#This ain't pizza until you use a pizza crust... So, I did. Well, sort of. I placed a ready-made roll out pie crust over the top, increased the temp, and saved some of the cheese to sprinkle on top for the last few minutes of baking. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Tried and true recipe. I made it with ground buffalo and a bit more spices, but how can you go wrong? Definitely try it.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#1#Don't know what these people are talking about it's not even a pizza as the zucchini crust never gets crispy it's a casserole
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This is one of my favorite recipes. I made this for my bunco group and they all wanted the recipe. This is a keeper!!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Good way to work some veggies into our diet.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Made this recently for a potluck. It was delicious! Even the people who said they didn't like zucchini loved it. This one is a keeper! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#0#Just picked a bag of zucchini so decided to try this recipe for supper. I doubled the recipe except used 1 1/2 lb ground beef and added a little garlic powder, italian seasoning and basil to the sauce. Baked the crust for 27 minutes but will do longer next time as the casserole ended up a little watery. Used a 25 minute second bake. Even my zucchini hating husband raved about it! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#We really liked this. A good way to get your veggies!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#0#This is so simple and so good! Had an abundance of zucchini from the garden and this is one of our favorite ways to eat zucchini. The only change I made is that sometimes I add slices of pepperoni before adding the cheese topping. A winner!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This is a great way to use up all that zucchini! I added some garlic and using sausage gave it more flavor.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was wonderful! My husband and I are both on keto, and this tasted so good! It makes for good leftovers as well. I followed the recipe exactly except for using frozen zucchini (lots of water to squeeze out!) because I didn't have any fresh on hand. I will definitely be making this again when we have a bunch of zucchini fresh from our garden! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Absolutely Awesome and fit perfectly into my keto diet!! My entire family LOVED this recipe. I used deer-burger vs hamburger as that is what I had on hand -- delicious!!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#1#Love this thank you made with ground turkey breast yummy and freezes well for lunches
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#We loved it. Hubby said it was a definite keeper and was even better the next day. Only changes I made based on some other readers was to make sure the water was squeezed out of the zukes, and I added a can of mushrooms, Italian herbs, and extra mozzarella (because I had it). Can't wait to make it again. Next time am going to add Italian sausage to it. Great recipe. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Perfect as is. Almost no carbs.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Made this again with turkey sausage instead of the hamburger. Much tastier, and hubby loved it. So need to up the rating to a 5 instead of a 4. Would definitely have again and again
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Excellent! Was looking for another low carb dish when I found this. I sauteed some chopped mushrooms and added them to the sauce, omitted the pepper cause we don't like it. I used marinara sauce that was low in sugar in place of the tomato sauce. This is very tasty! My hubby suggested next time to use Italian sausage instead of ground beef but I thought it was perfect. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#My husband said this is a keeper. I added some red pepper flakes to the zucchini mixture, Used Prego pizza sauce & added garlic & Italian seasoning to the meat. He is on a low carb diet.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This is just delicious! I followed the directions exactly. We all loved it!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#2#0#We love this casserole ! We are on a low-carb diet, my husband and I, and have a craving for Italian food, especially pizza. This has solved our problem without busting the diet. After the first time I made it, I have changed it a bit, not in the recipe, but in the preparation. Since there are only 2 of us, I make the bottom crust in 2 8X8 inch pans, lined with parchment paper, partly up the side, and sprayed with cooking spray. I make half of the recipe in each, and cook it as directed. After cooling, I lift it out by the parchment, put both in a freezer container, and freeze until we are ready to use it. When we need a pizza, we take one crust , thaw it in the 8X8 pan, and put the toppings on, cook it in the oven as the recipe calls for. It is almost as quick as a frozen pizza! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Loved it! Did add some more Italian seasoning to it.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I did as someone suggested, made half the recipe & put in 8x8 baking dish. I used Prego, and squeezed the zucchini with paper towels to remove more moisture. FABULOUS! Even my zucchini-hating hubby loves this! Will be making this again!!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Have made this several times and everyone loves it!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Turned out amazing. Kids loved it. I cooked the red pepper with the ground beef and onions.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Very tasty!! To those who thought it was too soggy/goopy, squeeze the zucchini in your fist to remove the extra liquid. We loved this.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Excellent recipe. I wouldn't call it pizza per se, reminded me more of carb-less lasagna. I cut the amount of ground beef in half, doubled the onions and added about as much mushrooms. I used jarred Barilla traditional pasta sauce. Next time I'm thinking of using only half the cheese in the zucchini mix and replacing that amount with more zucchini, and double the salt. I'll also add garlic as many commenters have suggested. It holds up well as leftovers. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#So delicious! I did use fresh grated Parmesan cheese and topped with fresh sliced mozzarella. Didn't add any shredded mozzarella to the zucchini mixture only used Cheddar and Parmesan and still came out great! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Made it with Italian sausage instead of ground beef and added 2 tsp minced garlic. Yummy! Everyone loved it! I like the zucchini crust especially since it cuts down on carbs. Will definitely be making this again!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Excellent! I liked it better fresh out of the oven so I will stick to a 1/2 recipe (8 square pyrex) to limit leftovers. Delicious!! (PS - I used ground chicken instead of beef to lower cholesterol - couldn't tell one bit of difference.) 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was fantastic! We don't eat a lot of pizza because of the carbs, so this is an incredible substitute for pizza! We will definitely be making it again! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#0#Very tasty, versatile crust. Great way to use up the zucchini overload. Even those who don't care for zucchini will enjoy it. Have made it with a layer of ricotta, fresh tomatoes and basil instead of the the meat sauce for a vegetarian alternative. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I also added some extra Italian seasoning and garlic powder. My husband, who usually does not care for vegetables, went back for more!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This is also good as a Mexican casserole. Switch your cheeses to Mexican mix cheeses and pepper jack. Same with sauce, try rotel or even an enchilada sauce with chunky salsa.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Been making this for years, I call it zucchini parmesian. I saute some fresh garlic, coat the zuchiini with some flaoved breat crummbs then fry just a little,put in casserole dish, then just ad my marinara sauce, mozzarella and parmesian and bake. Very flavorful with just the two cheeses.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Just made this and will be making it again but found it a bit bland, so the next time I make it I'll be adding a little heat and different (more pungent) cheese combination. I didn't saute the red peppers and loved it that way. Hubby just went for seconds - a good sign. Update: Just realized I used tomato sauce instead of a spiced Italian sauce. My bad. Trying it again - this time I'll read the directions more carefully. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#We have made this many times and love it. I use pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce which is more flavorful. To lighten it up a little, we use 2 percent cheese and turkey italian sausage or turkey pepperoni. Very easy to freeze and take in my lunch later too.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#WE LOVED THIS!!!!!!! Will definitely make again.My husband said it's better than spaghetti. Used canned pizza sauce and Parmesan on top. Could use a little more zucchini. I think I need to start growing zucchini. LOL 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was amazing!! HUGE hit!!!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Absolutely delicious and so easy!!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This recipe is really good, and a great summer dish for when zucchinis are in abundance. I loved the zucchini crust. It was such a nice change of pace to a heavy bread crust. The only changes I made were based on using ingredients on hand - used an Italian cheese blend for the mozzarella and a colby-jack blend for the cheddar because I had both of those. I love a dish that is versatile in that way so just use whatever cheese combo you like best on this dish and you should have a winner. Also, I took the advice of others and cooked the bell pepper with the beef and onions because my family prefers that combo. My skeptical pizza loving daughter ate this and said it was good. I will definitely be making this dish again.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Loved this recipe. The only thing I did differently was I cooked the peppers with beef and onions. Tastes even better as leftovers the next day!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This recipe is really really good. I've also used the zucchini, cheese, and egg mix as the base for Eggplant Parmesan instead of pasta. Everyone loves it. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Love this ......great way to use up a jar of pizza sauce too... come summer everyone has Zucchinis ....everything is in this meal too...a filling side dish or a complete meal.... Made it in ramekins...a good way to serve it too...spray the ramekins tho...sausage substitute work's as well...biggest deal is getting ALL the water out of the Zucchini .... 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Has become a favorite at my house, added two cloves of garlic to the sauce and half onion and its delicious !
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I made this years ago for my veggie hating kids. Making it now for my veggie hating grandkids. Hubby and I love it and the grandkids don't know what they're eating! Works for me!! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I have made this many times now and every time it's still fantastic! Only changes I've made is that I use frozen chopped peppers and onions and cook them with the hamburger, I also use plain tomato sauce and just add italian seasoning and garlic. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This is excellent. I loved that it tastes like pizza and the zucchini was essentially hidden in the dish. I did make a few changes - ground turkey instead of ground beef and I ran out of mozzarella cheese so I ended up using cheddar to replace it. I would absolutely make this again, maybe adding a few pizza toppings to it as well.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#0#This deserves all the fantastic reviews! If you are looking for recipes that will work well with a spiralizer, I used my thin-cut zucchini noodles instead of shredding them and it was great. I loved seeing my kids inhale all the zucchini!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#1#I made this casserole on 11/1/16 and it's delicious! I did use 3 small red peppers, ground turkey in place of the beef, 2 cups shredded Pizza cheese blend and 1 cup Pepper-Jack/Cheddar cheese blend since I had those prepared cheeses on hand. I'd also added 1 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper to the ground turkey/chopped onion and I used a 15-oz. can pizza sauce. I used a 3-qt. casserole. delowenstein 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I made this today, and it was easy and delicious. I will definitely make it again.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#With over 200 5-star reviews, I felt this dish was a no brainer. (I like to try new TOH recipes that don't have as many reviews yet, but I wanted a sure fire meal for tonight.) It was YUMMY.....loved the baked shredded zucchini-cheese base and can't go wrong with a tomato beef mixture with more cheese. Two thumbs way up and a perfect casserole to make anytime. Husband liked as much as I did. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This is definitely a do it again. I will try adding some other pizza toppings next time. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#My husband really enjoyed the meal. Didn't have enough of some of the cheeses, used what I had. Next time I'm going to top it with saute or canned mushroom, you could top it with any of your favorite topping. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was very good. Will be making again very soon. Thank you for such a great recipe.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Outstanding recipe! Anyone who's tasted this ALWAYS requests the recipe. Yes, it's that darn good! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Made this tonight for supper. There was just the 2 of us. We liked it so much we ate over half of it. Leftovers tomorrow. I followed recipe pretty much to a tee, loved it!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Excellent! I used half summer squash and half zucchini-a perfect use for some of the squash our garden is giving us. I substituted mild provolone cheese for the cheddar and added some slices of turkey pepperoni for a little more pizza flavor. I also gave the top of the casserole a sprinkling of Penzey's Frozen Pizza seasoning-that really sealed the deal. We loved this casserole-I'll definitely be making it again. Thank you, Lynn! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This recipe was so easy to make. A little different way to use zucchini. My guests loved it.Served six, not eight. I will definitely make it again.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I've made this twice in the last two weeks, as it's become one of my husband's top faves of my recipes. It's just the two of us, so I always halve the recipe and bake it in an 8X8 pan (it takes a little less time, and I cover it for the last ten minutes of baking to prevent over browning), and we get three dinners out of it. This time, I made it in the morning, as (1) it doesn't heat the house up quite as much earlier in the day, and (2) we both think it tastes better after it sits awhile. I generally avoid cheesy-meaty dishes during the hotter months, but this one doesn't come off as heavy because of the zucchini crust . I've made it without the peppers on top or with roasted red peppers, and it's super either way. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I'm going to try making this tonight with pepperoni instead of ground meat 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Made this for the second time yesterday. It was very good. Will definitely make it often during zucchini season.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Excellent recipe!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#My family devoured this delicious dish. After reading the reviews I made sure to dry the zucchini well, and I jazzed up my sauce with some fresh herbs (basil, parsley and oregano) and garlic, and instead of ground beef I used hot and spicy breakfast sausage I had on hand. Can't wait to make it again with a layer of sauteed mushrooms! Thanks for this great recipe. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#1#This was one of the worst recipe I have ever tried from your site. It was a total mush bunch of green goop and I had to throw it out. What a waste of my time it preparing it.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was excellent! Recommend: cooking red pepper with beef and adding garlic, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes to amp up the flavors! We really enjoyed this!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I made this yesterday with zucchini fresh from the garden. I actually cut the recipe in half, and it turned out just fine. I also did not use hamburger but instead, we used 1 cup of pepperoni .
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Very good and easy! I used tofu for the hamburger!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I made this tonight and I must say it is delicious. I did take a couple of suggestions from others: 1) I drained the zucchini for about 30 minutes then I pressed out as much moisture as I could in the strainer - then transferred to paper towel and blotted some more - my casserole was not runny; 2) I added 1/2 tsp basil and 1/2 tsp oregano and 2 minced garlic cloves to tomato sauce mixture and sauteed the green peppers with the meat and onion. The sauce was anything but bland. I will be making this recipe for a long time to come. Thank you.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I've made this recipe several times as written. It's a great way to use zucchini and it's always a hit. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Excellent! Great low carb dish to satisfy cravings for pizza. Will be making this and changing up the meat/veggies to make different varities(this time I used ground beef,mushrooms and black olives. I also added seasoning to tomato sauce (red pepper flakes, garlic powder and Italian seasoning.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Awesome! We practically cleaned out the bowl. No left-overs, so sad.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This recipe is great; it's delicious and different. We tried it with sausage instead of beef first, and that was way too salty; that is not the fault of the recipe though. I add Italian seasoning to the sauce and cook the green pepper with the onion. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#My picky family liked this recipe. I made it as written, except that I added minced garlic when browning the ground beef and also used pizza sauce instead of Italian tomato sauce. I may try some other options next time, like adding mushrooms.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Very good recipe!! I, too, added a bit more seasoning to the meat (oregano and garlic) but otherwise made as written. I tend to like my food a bit more spicy so thought maybe I'd add some dried pepper flakes to the meat the next time. Very good warmed up the next day, too!! I can't wait for zucchini season to make this again and again!!! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I don't eat carbs (pasta, etc) and can't wait to make this. Will probably add some ricotta on top of the zucchini. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Everyone loved this.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I passed this recipe along to a friend who made it for a church potluck and everyone wanted the recipe. She made some and brought it to work and got the same rave reviews!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Love, love, love this recipe! And it reheats wonderfully. Great way to sneak in veggies too.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This is delicious but needs to be seasoned. I added oregano, basil, salt and pepper. I added a couple of cloves of garlic to the onion/hamburger blend while browning. My anti-zucchini family really enjoyed it.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#great tasting will make it again my guests loved it and asked for the recipe it was yummy everyone had two helpings. it was easy to make .
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was delicious and a great way to use up zucchini. I love the fact it had vegetables in it and my son had no idea!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I made this for my family using fresh Zucchini from our garden. I will definitely make it again, especially for my husband.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Good way to use garden zucchini.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This dish was very tasty, my husband loved the dish. I added slices of pepperjack cheese to the topping. Will definitely make again.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#1#0#Family loves this recipe!! I skipped the green pepper, but added garlic and mushrooms. I used one can of tomato sauce and 1 can of diced tomatoes drained and pureed to give it some texture and also added Italian seasoning, basil and garlic powder. I have shared this with many friends. Thank you!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#My husband and I loved this dish - very flavorful and easily made. I followed the recipe as written except for the substitution of pizza sauce for the tomato sauce. I like that this casserole may also be frozen and the next time I make it (and there will definitely be a next time!) I think I will put it into two 8 dishes and pop one in the freezer for later. Great recipe! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I made this recipe the other night and it is Fantastic. I didn't use tomato sauce... I used a can of stewed tomatoes and added 1 tblspn of basil and thyme to make it more Italian. I cooked it down until the liquid dissipated. It was Super Delicious!!!! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Awesome!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I have enjoyed this recipe, as written and it was delicious. I have now added my own additions and use hot sausage in place of the beef. I have also used pizza sauce to make it more like pizza and added traditional pizza toppings. Great taste anyway you decide to make it and it is a great recipe for those that are doing keto or low carb diets.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Made for dinner tonight for my adult son and I!Omgosh, it's so delicious, thank you ,I didn't have mozzarella so I grated string cheeseI used two can tomato sauce and sprinkled with Italian seasoning and garlic powder! YumOh an a dash of sugar, yes sugar about a teaspoon! I omitted the green peppers didn't have any, but sprinkle chopped green onions (scallions) yumI wanted to get seconds, think I'll wait till tomorrow CALORIES LOLGOOD LUCKMUCH ALOHACINDY WILSON 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Easy to fix and great taste. I used pepperoni instead of ground beef to make more pizzalike. Family would have liked it more if had a firmer crust.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was very good and I liked adding nutrition by using zucchini instead of a bread crust.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#great recipe. Good way to use up all the zucchini from our garden.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I cut in squares and took to a Potluck, it was a hit! My changes were I used 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 pork sausage. Had eggplant in garden so grated in with zucchini. Will make again.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#My husband is NOT a picky eater - but my children and I are. We all loved this so much we made it twice and brought it to a family party where it was devoured! Great texture, flavor and taste. I made sure to not only drain the zucchini but blotted it with paper towels - It was PERFECT!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was wonderful tasting! In place of the ground beef I used sausage and in place of the Italian tomato sauce I used homemade marinara. The zucchini will be soggy if you don't drain it properly, but it still tastes good. You can pour off the extra liquid for nice and firm leftovers. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Awesome will make again and again
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Very good! I used sausage instead of ground beef.. Also added pizza sauce to tomato sauce because I didn't have Italian tom sauce. I will definitely make again.. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Very good, but extremely high in fat and cholesterol. So not really a healthy dish but very tasty. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Made this tonight and we both loved it. Since I just had regular tomato sauce, I added Italian seasoning and some garlic powder. Definitely a keeper.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I made this for my husband's coworkers. It was a big hit. Very easy to make and a great way to get people to eat their veggies. I added one tsp of parsley to the sauce bc I could only find plain sauce. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I made this dish for a book club I just recently joined. It was a big hit . BANG!!everybody wants the recipe, Great way to utilize the abundance of veggie this time of year,
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Family loved it. Next time I'll double it. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I made this tonight for supper with few adjustments -- package of ground turkey was a little more than a pound so added more onion plus used Prego Chunky Garden Tomato, Onion & Garlic spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. Didn't measure the cheese -- anyone who loves cheese doesn't care if there is more. Most of the ingredients as to the amounts can be adjusted to your preference. It was wonderful. My husband thought it was really good & kept taking a little more & a little more. I will definitely be making it again. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was really good. I thought it tasted more like lasagna than pizza. Maybe it was because I used a jar of spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato sauce. I did follow the ret of the recipe. I will make this again!!!!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#My husband HATES zucchini! When I served this dish, he raved and raved about it. He thought the zucchini crust was actually rice, but when I told him what it really was, he just smiled and went back for seconds!!! I will definitely make this again. Next time, we may add olives to it for some extra zing, but the recipe is great as-is!!!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This got my husbands 2 thumbs up...had it today for lunch. I did add 1tsp each, basil, oregano and garlic powder to sauce along with fresh mushrooms on top. Definitely a keeper!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#i saw that this was one of the best rated casseroles so it inspired me to try it. It wasn't anything to really rave about and I wouldn't make it again unless I added something like sausage. Maybe that would be better. It tasted kind of bland to me. Needed some spices to taste like pizza 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I fixed this last night for my husband & me~delicious! I used venison for the meat & a little variation on the cheeses~added my own spices to tomato sauce~only because this is all I had on hand but you couldn't ask for it to be any better than this! Thank you~definitely a keeper:) 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#1#I've been a subscriber to Taste of Home since the very early 90's and have to say this is my first review of any recipe. Believe me, my family has many favorite TOH recipes, but I have to say this is excellent. I added a teaspoon each of dried basil, oregano, and garlic powder to the zucchini mixture. Instead of ground beef I used 1/2 lb each of ground sirloin and turkey sausage. I also used mushrooms. I know I hate when someone rates a recipe after they changed it, but it would be just as delicious made as printed. Thanks Lynn for a great way to use up an abundance of zucchini! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Excellent!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Whole family loved it! Added some oregano , basil and garlic powder. Next time will replace 1/2 pound of burger with Italian sausage
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I look forward to making this dish. I love zucchini and pizza so this is a great combo. And it's a good way to get my family to eat more veggies. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I forgot to tell you that I added 1 C quick oatmeal and 1 C chopped walnuts to the reserved crust for the topping.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#very good
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I loved this recipe. Different. Great way to use zucchini. Flavors even better day 2 and beyond. Enjoying to the last bite!!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Had last night for dinner and it was excellent. We are trying to go low carb and this looked great. I made sure the zucchini was well drained and I baked it 25 minutes and the crust was fine. I did leave out the cheddar cheese and added more Parmesan. I also used turkey Italian sausage for more flavor and we don't eat much beef. Topped with it with regular jar spaghetti sauce since that is all I had and yellow peppers, onion, some garlic. So yummy! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was a great recipe to use up zucchini. I would make this again.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Both my husband and I liked it and my kids loved it! I did add some seasonings to the crust: garlic, Italian seasoning, basil, and oregano.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This wasn't bad, but I thought the green pepper overpowered everything and I like green pepper. I used spaghetti sauce and added some garlic powder and fresh basal to the sauce. I think I will try again, but will put mushrooms and black olives on top and skip the green peppers. Definitely worth making again with some tweaking. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#My husband and I loved it. Since we live in New Mexico I added chopped green chile. It is a keeper. Next time I will also add fresh mushrooms.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was good, but I think I like LKimK77 recipe so I'm going to try it except for home made sauce, I'll use pizza sauce and no bell pepper (we can't eat them) I'll use a banana or sweet pepper 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was awesome. My entire family loves it. I usually use sausage, pizza sauce and add green peppers, and fresh mushrooms. This is a keeper.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I love this recipe! It's one of the reasons we grow zucchini! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Excellent Recipe! A definite do over . 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This is a awesome pizza for a gluten free diet. I used my home made red sauce omitted the cheddar cheese and topped it with sauteed mushrooms, onions, orange pepper, & black olives, and topped with green onion before serving.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Delicious!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Followed SKS2's review and made with spaghetti sauce. Husband and 1 year old loved it! Will definitely make again. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#How I made the recipe shown: I did green onion instead of white onion, no ground beef, turkey bacon without nitrates, red and green bell peppers diced, and my bottom layer (crust) also contained squash with the zucchini. I used a food processor attachment to shred the zuke and squash. Added an extra egg white as I had I had more veggies at the bottom layer. Added crushed red pepper to my pizza sauce layer. IT WAS AWESOME!!!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was very good. I used spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato sauce.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Loved this and enjoyed the leftovers a few days later. Delicious! I added a small can of petite diced tomatoes (well drained). Have prepared it several times already.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#1#Great way to use up my vast supply of zuchinni
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#My husband loved this dish and was happy that there were leftovers for his lunch the next day. After reading other reviews I was very careful to make sure I really got the moisture out of the zucchini and was glad I had. This came out great. I will definitely be making again and may follow some of the suggestions for other toppings like pepperoni or maybe even using the sausage in place of the ground beef.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#My family didn't like it the zucchini was too soggy. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was a big hit with my family. It's definitely worth giving it a try!!! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Love this casserole - great way to use up summer zucchini - I have made several - so we have some in the freezer for later!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Actually tastes even better the next day as a leftover
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#MY HUSBAND LOVED IT, AND BROUGHT SOME FOR LUNCH TO WORK. HE TOLD AND SHOWED IT OFF . ANOTHER GUY WANTED RECEIPE.I DID ADD PEPPERONI ONTOP WITH WITH ITALIAN STYLE-SIX CHEESE BLEND -AS FINISHING TOUCH.EVEN LOOKED BETTER...
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#When I first mentioned this to DH, his response was somewhat short of enthusiastic. But his motto is I'll try anything once. He absolutely raved about this dish. After reading many of the reviews, I made sure that my zucchini was as dry as possible. I didn't use salt, but squeezed the shredded zucchini through some linen towels and then lit it sit for about a half hour. Then squeezed it through paper towels. I really wanted a firm crust so baked it for 25 minutes rather than 20. That timing was absolutely perfect; the edges were just starting to brown. I added garlic, red pepper flakes and some dried oregano to the sauce, and sprinkled some fresh julienned basil on top of the casserole right before baking. The ground beef was more prevalent a flavor than I had expected, and the zucchinie was less. This is a great casserole in which to hide vegetables. We'd love to try it with Italian sausage instead of the ground beef, but unfortunately that would raise the fat content through the roof. All and all, a yummy recipe. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#We didn't care for this at all. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Delicious. Added a little crushed pepper flakes
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I made this casserole just as wrtten and it was good. The next time I made it I used italian sausage instead of the ground beef and it was fantastic.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was a major hit in our home. My daughter is a veggiei-hater and she even loved it. This is a definite future meal in our home again.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Made this for dinner last night. It wasn't bad, but I wasn't blown away by it. I didn't really taste the zucchini, so it would be a good way to sneak some in on a veggie hater. Left off the green peppers & topped mine with mushrooms & black olives. I will probably make it again, but not often as there is a lot of cheese! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#We loved this. I have to admit though, that I added basil and oregano from the garden and more salt and pepper.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Made just as written (except for subbing pasta sauce for tomato sauce). A keeper for sure. Love the low carb!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Everyone likes this casserole who've tried it! I use pizza sauce and add pizza toppings that we like: mushrooms, turkey pepperoni, pineapple, etc. I make it very often year round. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#It was great. The hardest part was drying our the zucchini. I added mushrooms and olives.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#My son didn't really like this, but I did. Of course, he doesn't like lasagna (I can't explain it), so that may be part of it. But I liked the zucchini...I might have to experiment with it a bit more... 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Awesome recipe! I deviated a bit substituting ground turkey for ground beef and using a Monterey Jack Jalapeño cheese blend instead of the cheddar. This recipe is great for low carb diets. I look forward to making it again with other popular pizza toppings like mushrooms!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#So, good
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I love zucchini. This casserole is very good and leftovers are good too!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I wasn't sure that my family would go for this one, but my two worst critics, the husband and the picky son loved it. I would agree with everyone else that the zucchini needs about 20 min to drain and I took handfuls and squeezed it out and had no problems. Will be making again soon!! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Excellent!! It has already become a family favorite, & I've made it several times. I added some pizza seasoning to the sauce to make it take even more pizza-y. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#very good!!!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#After I wrote my review I was reading all the others and quite a few was talking about it being watery. First, let it stand about 20-30 minutes then squeeze it out by handfuls, that really helps, but I found if I baked the crust about 30-35 minutes or longer before adding the sauce makes for a firmer crust. Love it!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I seen this recipe on here last year and have made it several times now. My husband loves it so much I even had to buy zucchini from the store during the winter months and into summer till the zucchini was ready again. Once when I had been canning some homemade pasta sauce, I had a bit left over in the refrigerator and decided to use that in place of the tomato sauce, it was excellent. Also, have used leftover taco meat. That was good too. Thanks!!!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Very good!!!!! I wish I had this recipe at the beginning of zucchini season. Will definitely make again. Three people ate all most the whole dish!!!! I let the zucchini set with the salt a good 20 minutes. I used some of my homemade salsa and homemade spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. I also topped with some of my pickled Hungarian waxed peppers. Excellent flavor.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was delicious. I substituted pizza sauce for the tomato sauce, and used pepperoni instead of ground beef. Yummy! Leftovers were great!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Excellent. I didn't think my husband would like this, be he did!! He thought it would make a good dip. It truly is a unique way to use zucchini, and it was delicious. Good leftover, too. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This is a fabulous way to use up extra zucchini!! I double the meat/tomato mixture as my husband and boys needed a meatier dish. I didn't have italian tomato sauce and have found that one big can of Hunt's Spaghetti sauce is perfect for the doubled mixture. I agree, it is even better the next day. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Excellent recipe. Will definitely make again.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Four out of four adults in this family did not care for this at all. It was too rich and greasy with all the cheese.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#So good and so easy! Wonderful way to use zucchini.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Very Very good - followed the advice from other comments... I let the zucchini sit for 30 minutes and squeezed out by the handful, added 1/2 lb of mild Italian sausage and pepperoni's on top.. Even better the next day. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was amazing! Draining the water out of the zucchini was more time consuming.. plan for atleast 15 minutes. I added fresh basil on top. All 3 kids and my husband LOVED it!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was so good, will make it again. The only thing i did different was used pizza sauce instead of the tomatoe sauce.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I let my shredded & salted zucchini sit for about 20 minutes, then squeezed as much of the liquid out as I could by handfuls since I felt I would be able to get more out that way. After I pressed it into the dish I used several paper towels to soak up excess liquid. After baking the zucchini was still a little liquidy , but not bad. I'm wondering how it would be with 1 egg instead. With the 2 eggs it didn't seem to bind the zucchini, in fact it seems the cheese would do a good enough job.I used spaghetti sauce and added a little more garlic and a very small sprinkling of oregano and basil. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Terrific recipe. I did sub my homemade pizza sauce for the tomato sauce because that's what I had. I left out the cheddar and increased the two other cheeses to make it up. I also added pepperoni. Will make this again and again, thanks! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This is one of my favorite recipes only I add one can of diced tomatoes and use one small can of sauce instead of the 15 oz can of sauce.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was so good. Probably one of the best zucchini recipes I have made. I didn't have any green peppers, but used pepperonis on top instead. I premade the casserole the day before, but waited to put the remaining cheese and pepperonis on top until the last 10 minutes of reheating. Before I put the pepperonis on top I microwaved them a bit and blotted off the grease. Then I cut them up and sprinkled them on top. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I made this late night and everyone loved it. I replaced the ground beef with ground turkey, and added oregano, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the meat sauce.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Made this casserole exactly as the recipe is written - next time tweaked it and used 1/2 hamburger and 1/2 italian sausage only because we like a little more spice. This is a wonderful recipe - our entire family loved it even my picky father-in-law and our 4 1/2 year old granddaughter. This is a keeper!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This recipe is delicious ! I baked the crust for 30 min, replaced the green pepper with green and black olives. Will definitely make again.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I loved this recipe, but used chopped pepperoni slices to make it really taste like pizza.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This is my new favorite recipe. I have made this dish about 6 times in the last 4 months. I use a pound of sausage and a pound of ground beef, cook them both; combine with the spaghetti sauce and than divide. I use one mixture right away, and freeze the other for a later use.You can also make the zucchini crust a day early and assemble the whole recipe; put it in the fridge, and bake the next day for dinner.This is my new lasagna--and so much cheaper too!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Very good!! The process of drainig the zucchini was long. I drained it for 30 minutes, squeezed it and drained again for 30 minutes. I then rolled it in a towel to make sure all the liquid was gone. I used mild turkey sausage and added garlic and italian seasoning to the meat. I will make this again but next time I will cook the zucchini longer until it is golden brown and starts to get crusty.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#My husband and I love this dish! I substitute the hamburger for Italian style ground turkey which gives it more flavor than regular hamburger.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Used Italian sausage for meat. Very good use for zucchini.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Trying to watch my carbs, this is delish! I used pizza sauce and topped it with mushrooms and italian sausage crumbled-yum! Put in containers for lunch this week.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Our family loved this! My husband (not a huge zucchini fan) and my one-year-old son both ate two pieces. Since my family is smaller, I made it in two pie plates so we could give one away. Worked perfectly! I agree with other reviews that the zucchini needs to drain longer - at least 20-30 minutes - to get properly dry. Otherwise it's a bit soggy. Will definitely make again! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Delicious! Added a shredded potato to the zucchini mixture because I didn't have quite enough zucchini. Also added mushroom. Definately a keeper! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I really liked this recipe quite a bit. The flavors were excellent together and I loved the juiciness of the dish. It was delicious. I added a little crushed red peppers and some mushrooms to the sauce. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#All 8 of us loved the flavor! Not hugely filling as is and quite watery from the zucchini. Next time I made it decided to add 2-3 C. of cooked spaghetti to zucchini/cheese mixture. Delicious and completely filling. Have made it several times now and works out great. Has become a big favorite.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I'm not a huge fan of zucchini, but am trying to eat more veggies. This was wonderful! I didn't even taste the zucchini. I made this as is, but it definitely lends itself to experimenting. Yum!!! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Tasted great but was too mushy.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it even my 6yr old. Good meal for my diabetic husband, he said it was very filling.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I absolutely loved this recipe and so did my husband. It was especially tasty for leftovers the next day. I will definitely make this again!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#What a great recipe!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#One of my 12 year olds favorite things! We add a bit more cheese than it calls for. Great for warming up at work the next day!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This recipe is quick, easy and delicious. It's definitely a favorite for our family. I've shared it with friends and the reviews are the same. I do have a couple additions that I feel complete the dish[although not necessary] -fresh garlic and fresh basil. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Of course, I always have to tweak a recipe, but I did add a bit of basil and marjoram to the meat/tomato sauce mixture. I also added minced garlic. I probably strained the zucchini for about 20 minutes. I probably squeezed 2 cups of liquid out of it. It still seemed wet, but when I mixed it with the cheese, it was almost a little too dry to combine until I mixed the eggs in. I also sliced roma tomatoes, sprinkled with basil, pepper, and salt, on top before adding the top layer of cheese. I'll definitely make this again. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I did not soak my zucchini and I use tomato sauce with Italian Herbs. Everyone loved it!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Love this recipe, cheesy and delicious! I am always looking for new ways to use zucchini from my garden.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#My whole family really liked this recipe. The only thing I did different was I added some dried oregano and basil to the beef mixture, and crumbled 5 strips of cooked bacon on top along with the green pepper. I'll be making this again. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I made twice this to take to two different gatherings and everyone that tried it loved it. I have passed out several copies of the recipe and am still getting requests for it. I did add a little minced garlic to the sauce, then spinkled on fresh chopped basil and oregano on top before baking. Easy and tasty!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Absolutely delicious! My husband said, It's a do over. He also took the leftovers to work and shared a bite with his supervisor and his co-worker. They also loved it and requested their own serving next time. LOL! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#My son said that it tasted like my homemade pizza before he knew that there was zucchini in the crust. My family liked it. I will make it again.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Extremely disappointed. While it was tasty -- I added oregano and garlic to the sauce -- it came out a wet mess. Since I drained the meat mixture well and used sauce right from the can without adding water all I can think is 10 minutes isn't nearly long enough to salt-drain the zucchini, which I pressed to drain in the strainer and then squeezed in a towel. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Some one gave me three zucchinis and this was one of the recipes I tried, it was delicious. Looking forward to making it again.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was super!! My four kids came home from sports practice and loved it -- even the one who doesn't like zucchini. I doubled the ground beef and used a can of spaghetti sauce. I cooked onion and peppers with the meat. I added a layer of pepperoni on top the meat layer. I did not have cheddar cheese so omitted that. It was fantastic. I think I will try low fat cheese next time. It is an excellent way to use up zucchini!! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Absolutely wonderful!!! I substituted pizza sauce for the tomato sauce since this is a pizza recipe. I also added the onion along with the green pepper as pizza is normally made. I gave the recipe to 6 people the first day I made it for work.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I have made this twice so far and my family and neighbors love it.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#With no offense meant to the creator of this recipe, I felt cheated! With a name like Zucchini Pizza Casserole, I expected some pizza flavors. I didn't get any of that at all!!! It was tasty as made according to the recipe, but disappointing. I kind of thought the zucchini layer on the bottom would be more like a crust, but it wasn't. I will try this again, but I have some other ideas to ramp it up! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Deliciousness surpassed our expectations. Made it last night and can't wait till we have it leftover tomorrow night. Used Italian sausage in place of burger, and added a few banana pepper rings to the top. My husband said to be sure and write keeper before filing it away. I would serve this to company. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#My family loved it! Let the zucchini dry longer and omitted the salt. Next time my family asked me to add mushrooms. It was delicious!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#LOVE this recipe! Low carb (I'm diabetic) and so easy to sub lowfat ingredients.I made mine with low fat cheeses and ground turkey breast. Everyone loved it! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Too salty, I even omitted the pre salting, lacked substance...waste of my good zucchini!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Made this for my family and everyone loved it awesome recipe
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Awesome way to use up all that zucchini!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I didn't use the salt, just let it set for about 30 minutes like another review said to do. I added a little bit of oregano and basil to the tomato sauce since I didn't have Italian tomato sauce. I might cut back just a little on the cheese. Taste was excellent. Will be freeze zucchini so I can have this during the winter months. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Followed advice to be sure zucchini is very dry and used italian sausage instead of hamburger. This was awesome! A definite keeper for my family.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Very good - my family loved it. I used half spagetti sauce and half It talian tomato sauce and then added italian seasoning to give it a little extra kick. I will definately make this again.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Loved this! I would like to try adding fresh spinach to this next time. I used Italian seasoned gr. turkey. I also sauteed the chopped onion with the gr. pepper I also added some fresh basil to the turkey, onion and gr pepper mix. I used a nice marinar sauce from Trade Joes and did put black olives in under the top layer of cheese.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#My family LOVED this recipe! We will definitely will make this again....sooner than later.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I cooked the green pepper with the beef and onion, plus some garlic. Next time I'm not using any salt, and I may try ground turkey. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#1#For those worried about the sodium content, you don't need to sprinkle the zucchini with salt. Let it stand for 1/2 hour & then wring it out really well. It will be just as good as sprinkling with salt. Any recipe that has this much cheese will have a high sodium content, as cheese is loaded with salt. No need adding more if you can help it! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I use pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce and I added chopped onions ... it's so delicious and burst of flavors 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Have not made this recipe yet, but sounds really delish! My neighbor has an abundance of zucchini, while I only planted two plants this year. I will definitely print her out a copy of this recipe! Has anyone tried throwing in some sliced or chunked pepperoni too? Once I make the recipe as directed, I always tweek it, so I may add some pepperoni the second time. I know my family will love this recipe. Can't wait to make it and will report back : ) I may also make one for my son who went back to college, and is living in an apt. near campus. He and his room mates would love this : ) 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I made this for my family several months ago. Delicious !!!!! I have made it 4 more times since then. My husband raves about it and my teenage son eats the zucchini with no complaints. 5 stars from us
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was wonderful. My husband raved about it at work and had people request the recipe.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#One of the best recipes I've ever made. My family wants to know when I'll be making it again!!! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I made this for my family and they loved it. I will definetely make it again.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#My husband & I loved this recipe. I used Putanesca Spaghetti sauce and it was fabulous. I will be making it for our family picnic.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I used spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce and it worked great! Also, I omited the cheddar cheese and it was still delicious.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Wonderful, delicious, versatile, can't wait to make it again. The zucchini crust is fantastic. The key is to squeeze all the liquid out and then squeeze it again. You can make this any way you like your pizza. It also reheats very well for left-overs. Thanks for this great recipe. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Easy and delicious! I added some leftover mushrooms to the beef and onions and some black pepper.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#whole family loves this casserole, many come back for seconds
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Very simple and tasty. I think I might experiment with more toppings next time.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Very good. My husband and toddler went back for seconds. Will try adding mushrooms to sauce next time.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Delicious!! I don't care for zucchini or hamburger, but this was great! You can mostly taste cheese (yum). Also, depending on how you fix up the tomato sauce, it adds nice flavor (I added some red pepper as suggested). I also liked the green peppers on top- the crispness was a nice contrast.I would liken the bottom layer to an egg bake consistency and taste. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Was delicious. Mine came out a little soggy but perhaps I didn't get all the moisture out of the zucchini. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I made this and the next day it was all gone. Love it!!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#We really enjoyed this. I was concerned about putting a whole green pepper on top of the cheese, so I put most of it in with the beef and onion to cook. I also added some italian seasoning and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was amazing! I have been looking for recipes that taste delicious, but don't have the typical carbs (like pizza crust or lasagna noodles) and this was perfect. I will be adding this to my list of favorites for sure! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Love it, and I don't like zucchini! Actually used some Thai squash I had no idea what to do with. Tried some of the suggestions, the sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms and really like the result! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was an awesome recipe. I used mushrooms instead of the green pepper and am going to try some pepperoni next time. A keeper!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Went together well, tasted great! I would be very sure to really squeeze out the shredded zucchini. Mine was a little too moist, but still was great!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This is one of my favorite ways to use fresh zucchini and the abundance of banana peppers from the garden!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Delicious! My family's response, you better double this next time. Great way to get those veggies in for people who may not like zucchini. We did make one change, used pork sausage instead of ground beef. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This is a fantastic recipe. Great way to use zucchini. Wasn't much left for leftovers! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#yummy! I used frozen shredded zucchini and just drained the liquid. I used ground turkey and red pepper, and even my picky son liked it!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Yummy
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Has anyone tried freezing one?
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Everyone love it. We served it with olives and sour cream on the side. Yum!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Delicious and super easy to make
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This is a great way to use all that zucchini from the garden! Yum!!!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I have made this several times over the years. It's delicious as is; I usually halve it for our smaller family. Also, it's delicious to bake the zucchini base, and sprinkle on top diced chicken, green and red peppers, onion, olives, and salsa to taste (I use about 1 cup for half the recipe) to make a mexican pizza. Yum! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I treated just like a pizza and added to the top mushrooms, onions, the green pepper and turkey pepperoni. It was great!! I took it to a dog show and came home with an empty dish. To make it healthy I used Turkey pepperoni and turkey sausage and pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This is delicious and I love that it uses an entire big zucchini. My whole family loved it and I will make it again. I thought the bottom was a little soft and next time I make it, I will try adding a couple tablespoons of cornmeal to the zucchini mixture with the hopes of it becoming like polenta.MaryLynHope
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Wow! This recipe is very delicious! I made a couple of changes by using Italian sausage instead of hamburger and I added hot peppers to the top. I like spicey food so it turned out perfectly. Will definately make this again. Thanks.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Great! I think you could use italian sausage or ground turkey, and I would add more onions and more green peppers next time. I will also use some reduced fat cheese to cut calories somewhat. I also threw in somme fresh basil into the sauce, and will add even more next time.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#I tried this out for a potluck dish. Everyone enjoyed & was wanting the recipe! Will make again.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was very good. I think next time I will use some spicy chicken sausage instead of the ground beef. It was a nice alternative to our regular zucchini dishes
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Hi i lived in Belgium all my live and we ate leekes every day in soeps as a vegetebel, in cheese pei, we simmer the leek in butter and add some salt and pepper its just plein goed, we also ate tem because there goed for your kidneys.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was very tasty! I didn't have Italian tomato sauce, so I cooked the ground beef & onion with 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 tsp basil & oregano, some salt, crushed red pepper & paprika. I only used 1 can of tomato sauce and added a can of extremely well drained (I actually squeezed handfuls out) diced tomatoes. Delish! 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Made this tonight. DH says'it's a keeper'!My Changes: I used frozen shredded zucchini, so didn't need the salt to draw the water.Sauteed the green pepper with beef and onion.Sprinkled sliced ripe olives on top of the meat sauce, before putting on the cheeses.When cheeses melted as it cooked, the olives peeked thru. Will be making this again. Hope somebody gives us zucchini as i thought we had so much frozen from last year that we didn't plant any this year. Jan. 
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#Absolutely delicious! Fantastic as leftovers also!!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This was really a great way to use up the zucchini in the garden. It was delicious. Because my family really likes cheddar cheese I used a cup of cheddar on the top with the mozzarella. Everyone enjoyed it. I also made just the base without the top and served it with a chicken dinner. Went over well.
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#WE HAVE MADE THIS ZUCCHINI PIZZA CASSEROLE 3 TIMES ALREADY THIS SUMMER. WE LOVED IT. COULD PROBABLY FREEZE SOME GRATED ZUCCHINI AND MAKE IT THIS WINTER TOO. THANKS FROM NEBRASKA
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#1#I found this recipe as I had some fresh zucchini to use up. It turned out wonderful!!!It is definitely a keeper. My husband and toddler both loved it. The only thing I did different was sauteed my onion and green pepper and then cooked my meat and used my favorite spaghetti sauce. It was absolutely delicious!
Zucchini Pizza Casserole#0#0#This dish is to die for . We did not plant garden this year, but our neighbor provided us with an ample supply of zucchini.**Sincerely** 
Traditional Lasagna#4#0#This is quite literally, the BEST recipe I have ever found.  I am looking it up for the 30th time as it has been requested for a birthday dinner tomorrow.  By now, I should have it memorized! It does NOT disappoint.  
Traditional Lasagna#12#2#This recipe is very close to the one I've used all my nearly 58 years of marriage. It is in my Better Homes & Gardens cookbook I received as a shower gift. Mine calls for tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and either ricotta or cottage cheese, not both. I have a lasagna pan which is a bit deeper than the traditional 9x13 and it fills the dish. Everyone loves it when I serve it. 
Traditional Lasagna#20#2#I followed exactly. I found the sauce to acidic from the tomato paste so I added more sugar and adjusted seasonings. There was plenty of meat sauce and so my 9x13 pan was filled to the top as described. I did use no boil noodles with excellent results. The recipe turned out delicious. Why others didn't like it is just personal opinion. The recipe is a keeper. 
Traditional Lasagna#10#3#I've been making this lasagna for years, ever since I saw it in one of the contest winner books. I especially love the meat sauce, which I use for other recipes now. I have since been required to go gluten free (Celiac), but I've adapted it to the gluten free noodles. This is just delicious. 
Traditional Lasagna#30#14#This is the very best lasagna I have ever eaten. It is my go-to lasagna recipe and the only one I have made since discovering this recipe in TOH magazine years ago. My six boys love this, too. I suggest that you buy the best quality ingredients you can afford and don't buy the pre-shredded cheeses shred the cheese yourself. It makes a big difference. Love this!
Traditional Lasagna#46#6#Absolutely delicious! Everyone loved it. Was wondering if anyone has made ahead and froze, if so any advice?
Traditional Lasagna#2#4#It doesn't seem to have much sauce. What would you add to get more? 
Traditional Lasagna#16#1#I've been making this lasagna for many years, since I first discovered it in a Taste of Home cookbook. It's delicious and worth the effort! I've tried other lasagnas, but they don't compare to this one! 
Traditional Lasagna#13#1#Tastes delicious, Traditional or not. 
Traditional Lasagna#48#109#Don't call it traditional and include cottage cheese. What a disaster. 
Traditional Lasagna#24#1#I've made this 3 times now - I love this recipe it's delicious!
Traditional Lasagna#76#10#As with any recipe one tends to adjust to their own taste. That being said TOH altered my original submission of this recipe! I don't do all those layers and use only 2 layers of noodles (6 total). I continue to adjust my recipe twenty years later! Isn't that what all cooks do as we learn? One thing I will say is you must use fresh ingredients to get the best results - like shred the mozzarella (preshredded cheese contains chemicals that keep the cheese from caking and DOES affect the results). Also, don't use cheap ingredients (garbage in garbage out). If you use pre-processed ingredients don't blame the recipe!! I recently found a true Italian grocery and used their home made goat cheese ricotta and was amazed at the difference that made! In regards to the sauce-I have learned that weather (like humidity) actually makes a difference. I purposely make a thick sauce so the layers stay in place as I dislike runny lasagne. Again, personal preference! Thank you all for your comments and enjoy!!! 
Traditional Lasagna#11#34#Would be better without the cotton cheese and the provolone in my opinion. And more spices
Traditional Lasagna#3#26#Very good recipe but not enough spice. Very bland....too many noodles left over and not enough ricotta sauce to fill last layer.... I don't make lasagna so I followed the recipe exactly as it said....
Traditional Lasagna#21#0#Amazing recipe!! My husband's family loves their Italian food, and I was so nervous to make dinner for them. I found this recipe and have never looked back! The only thing I do different is I have equal parts of ricotta and cottage cheese (about 2 cups each), as we prefer a thicker consistency to really hold it together. Thank you so much!
Traditional Lasagna#8#2#I've made this lasagna several times, and it is fantastic. This is now my go-to lasagna recipe for special occasions. I've made it for Christmas Eve a few times, and am planning to make it again this year for Christmas Day. I love this recipe. 
Traditional Lasagna#10#3#This is just what lasagna should taste like, rich and delicious and like a warm food hug ! The sauce is incredible, even more so after adding a 1/4 cup of red wine! Added lots more tomato sauce after reading other reviews and it definitely was needed. Worth the effort to put such a tasty dish out for the family :)
Traditional Lasagna#11#2#This recipe is amazing and worth 5 stars. It is very close to a secret family recipe I have used for more than 50 years. Yes, you can use no boil noodles...if you must, but don't give this recipe a low rating if you do and find it didn't quite meet your expectations. Make the recipe using the ingredients as written. You won't be sorry.
Traditional Lasagna#16#5#This is the 3rd time I have made this recipe and my family loves and I use the sauce as any marinara sauce I need. A question to the author and readers. I just caught today the recipe calls for 3 8 oz cans of sauce. I had never noticed they were 8 oz cans and have been using the standard 15 1/2 . I could not imagine this with less. Was the 8 oz cans a typo or is that how everyone has been preparing? Regardless of the answer I will stick to the 3 larger cans but I am curious.
Traditional Lasagna#23#2#Can this be made with no boil lasagne noodles?
Traditional Lasagna#3#0#Edit to my last review : Change cans of sauce to Ro's SENSITIVE Jar sauce 
Traditional Lasagna#7#0#Best lasagna ever! My family loves it 
Traditional Lasagna#10#10#So a couple of things. 1. My family LOVES the meat sauce you make here so much, we use it like a marinara ALL THE TIME. 2. I have made this a couple times the only change is I use less cottage cheese. Example...total of ricotta and cottage cheese is about 4 cups so I do 2 of each...a better balance for us.
Traditional Lasagna#32#5#I spent two years in the Toscana region of Italy. The Italian snobs in here have no CLUE that this is actually BETTER than any lasagna to be found in Firenze (Florence), Bologna, or Milano (Milan). Cottage cheese? My first thought was ARE YOU KIDDING ME? But after trying it, I will concur that it is BETTER than ricotta alone. SALUD!
Traditional Lasagna#4#0#I finally got to make this recipe to the t and it is amazing! My little girl who doesn't eat any kind of combined foods loves it and asked me to make some again tonight. Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!
Traditional Lasagna#2#0#Best ever !
Traditional Lasagna#11#5#I've made this recipe for years and it has always been a big hit. This recipe screams traditional, american lasagna in the very best way. It's very difficult to mess this one up as I have not always had every ingredient it calls for on hand (provolone, sausage, ricotta, etc). I love seeing how everyone has put their own spin on it and it still comes out beautifully. 
Traditional Lasagna#12#1#I don't care if this is traditional Italian lasagna or not. What is important to me is that it tastes good. This looks like my long lost recipe for lasagna that I made in the 70's. I got it off a box of pasta. I am so glad to have found it again. I can't wait to make it. 
Traditional Lasagna#2#0#Love
Traditional Lasagna#7#2#I ran across this recipe and it reminded me of my older cousins lasagne. Once I made it the first time it became my go to guide on layering and the cottage cheese ands ricotta sauce.. .I use my own recipe for the sauce and I think the next time I'll make it how I did as a young adult with burgundy in it. Oh so good 
Traditional Lasagna#3#0#Love the use of provolone cheese. I added a little more sauce.
Traditional Lasagna#2#0#Delicious recipe - I've used it more than once. I always make just a little more sauce - we're sauce lovers. And one additional comment to Martin. 
Traditional Lasagna#2#0#I was wary using pork sausage, but what a great flavor it added to this dish! This was a big hit with the family.
Traditional Lasagna#8#1#Love it! I typically use more ricotta and less cottage cheese because it's hard to find an 8 oz. container of ricotta. I prefer Italian sausage to plain pork sausage. Glad there is no onion because my daughter can't tolerate them. Yum! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I am making this right now,but...I need someone to explain the reason for provolone cheese Isn't to dry? 
Traditional Lasagna#0#3#I changed 3 things, no sugar, used ricotta cheese
Traditional Lasagna#4#0#This recipe is absolutely amazing. I found this recipe 4 years ago when I had moved out on my own into my new house. This is my fourth time making it and it seems to get better every time!!!!! Good job taste of home!
Traditional Lasagna#6#1#Absolutely delicious! This was the best lasagna I have ever made! The tomato sauce was amazing. I made it exactly as written. I thought the seasoning would be a tad bland as it didn't seem like enough for the amount of sauce. I was wrong. It was perfect just the way it was. I haven't used sausage in my lasagna before and it will now be my norm!!!!!! This will be my go-to recipe from now on! Thanks Taste of Home! 
Traditional Lasagna#1#2#I just have 1 question, can this particular recipe be made with no boil lasagna noodles??
Traditional Lasagna#2#0#I was so surprised by how delicious this lasagna turned out to be. I've now made it 3 times and now it's my favorite! I made it exactly as written. 
Traditional Lasagna#10#5#Lasagna is not a dish that originated in Italy. So this is American Lasagna and it's delicious - it uses cottage cheese which is not as gritty as ricotta can be. Lasagna comes from the Greeks - I actually make a Greek lasagna better known as Pastitsio it is layered pasta with ground beef but when I want American Lasagna I make this recipe. Did you know the Brits actually found a recipe for Lasagna from the 1390's? Each country has perfected their own claim to Lasagna fame. When the Italians make it in Northern Italy they do not use ricotta cheese, they use a creamy cheese sauce known as besciamella. Ricotta is used in the Southern region only, this is why many Italians in America use ricotta - most are descendants from Southern Italians. So even Mario or Giada is making it wrong if you are from Tuscany. 
Traditional Lasagna#7#7#Real Chefs will tell you to try their recipe and feel free to take the recipe and put your own spin on it, using ingredients you like. Martin you are out of line with your criticism. I have eaten a similar lasagna at the home of Italian friends. How many times have you heard real chefs say traditional recipes will be different depending on the region of Italy it came from. So why don't you learn to keep your opinions to yourself and comment on the recipe only if you made it. Seeing your displeasure with the ingredients, I doubt that's going to happen. So keep it to yourself. Love your comment bldrblue! 
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#Delicious!!!
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#If you look at the ingredient list, the noodles are cooked and drained before assembling the dish.
Traditional Lasagna#11#4#Don't you just love the smell of pomposity in the morning? :) This recipe specifically states that it is American Lasagna. That differentiates it from Italian lasagna, but I have always found that rather than disparage a recipe because of your purist tastes, or dismissing it out of hand, try it. Different people like different things. I quite like both this version and the ones made in Italian kitchens. You will find differences in recipes from your own Mario and Giada, and I'm not sure I would rank either of them among the world class of chefs that you seem to suggest they are, Martin. I would also note that some of the best cooking came from the kitchens of housewives . Unbelievable. 
Traditional Lasagna#5#0#I have made this recipe since it appeared 18 years ago, it is absolutely the best. No matter what the negative reviews say, just try it and make it EXACTLY as it is written. I was skeptical but after making it ..the family loved it hands down and i'm a particular cook. Make it and try it...you're family will love it! 
Traditional Lasagna#4#0#Absolutely the best lasagne I have ever eaten. Hands down, will never make another recipe....truly fantastic!
Traditional Lasagna#2#1#Awesome base recipe. I didn't have provolone so just used extra mozzarella, will try provolone next time. I also added mushrooms and an onion. This was so yummy. 
Traditional Lasagna#3#0#I have always par boiled my Lasagna Noodles and your recipe doesn't require that step. Will the 50 min cooking then 20 min additional uncovered accomplish that. I live in a very small town in NE Arkansas and our 1 grocery store doesn't carry ricotta, so may I add more cottage cheese, and would I still use egg then. I was plan on making for dinner tonight. Thank you for sharing your recipe looks delicious. 
Traditional Lasagna#2#0#This is the best lasagna ever. I don't use pork sausage, I just add a few fennel seeds to my sauce to give a little sausage flavor. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Best ever!
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#Best I have ever, ever had !!! Soooooo good.
Traditional Lasagna#3#3#Took a HUGE chance and made this for the first time for our Christmas dinner and it was wonderful!!! It looked intimidating with such a long list of ingredients but it went seamlessly. I was also afraid it had too much cheese in it but I couldn't (and wouldn't) change a thing. A keeper for sure!! 
Traditional Lasagna#4#0#I was using a different lasagna recipe on this site, but having tried this one, there's no going back. I made it exactly as stated, but I used mild Italian sausages (out of their casings) and a full package of SMOKED provolone. This was one decadent, cheesy, saucy, meaty lasagna, and I have had nothing but rave reviews from friends and family, and requests to please make this again. Best ever. 
Traditional Lasagna#6#1#Wow, Susan, that is so rude to rate a recipe that you didn't even bother to try because you are some kind of lasagna snob. If the recipe is beneath your standards, just pass on by and find recipes more to your liking. Some of us are more interested in the food than in the tradition you use to make YOUR lasagna.
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#I so love the substitution of cottage cheese. I much prefer it to ricotta as I think ricotta tastes kind of dry. Great recipe
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#We love this recipe. Amazing!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I followed the recipe to the T but when I took the lasagna out it doesn't look right. I'm going to let it stay in the oven uncovered for so more time and come back over I taste it
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#Omg! This recipe is amazing!! I followed all the directions and it was delicious!! Thank you!
Traditional Lasagna#1#1#This is hands down the best lasagna recipe I have ever tried. My husband and sons both loved it! The recipe was very simple and I was worried that it would not be very flavorful, but this was perfect. The sauce was amazing and the cheese mixture was fantastic. Many lasagna recipes turn out very runny, but the cheese mixture in this was just right. I used the lasagna noodles that don't require cooking and made sure to allow the lasagna to sit on the counter for 15 minutes before cutting. This will now be our lasagna recipe from now on! Thank you for sharing Lorri! 
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#I don't usually write reviews but I just had to! I did add a cup of Cabernet red wine to the sauce but other than that kept to the recipe! My husband isn't much on pasta but he RAVED about this lasagna on the 3 bite and went back for seconds! It was truly delicious! I think I will make it for our family Christmas this year. 
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#Look no further, by far the best lasagna recipe. Easy and delicious.
Traditional Lasagna#2#0#This is, truly, a 5-star recipe! The best lasagna that I have ever eaten! The only tweak that I made was substituting seasoning salt for regular salt. Besides that, I followed it to a T . The whole family raved about it. Thanks for another winner :) 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This is wonderful. The addition of provolone cheese make it.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Yes, must agree. One of the best I have ever tried! Did leave out the cottage cheese , though. Added extra ricotta instead. Delicious!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Love, love, love this recipe!! It is so delicious, everyone raves over it. Will never make another lasagna recipe....ever!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#One of the best lasagna's I've had. I changed the beef and pork to only italian sausage. It was delicious! 
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#This will be my go to lasagna from now on. Perfect! Served it Christmas Eve to rave reviews from family and friends.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This has to be the best lasagna i have ever had. Only thing i changed is i used 1lb hot Italian sausage and 1/2lb gr beef. Amazing flavors. I love the provolone in this. This is my first time not popping a jar for the sauce and i will never go back. Thank you for sharing this recipe
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Pat Milo try it with real mozzarella and ricotta. cottage cheese cannot compare. you can leave out the meat. we like it without meat.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Made this last week, it was the best lasagna I have ever made! So said hubby. Only changes I made was to use Italian sausage instead of the pork, and no boil noodles. I did add about a cup of water to the sauce to provide enough moisture for the noodles. The recipe is a keeper! Yes, it takes longer to cook, but so worth the effort!
Traditional Lasagna#3#0#Emily and graysmommy it might not be a bad idea to stick with take out if you can't make this delicious lasagna 
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#Made this yesterday. I used 24 oz. pasta sauce with basil instead of plain tomato sauce. I also added 1t oregano. Used non-boil lasagna. Assembled everything a day ahead and cooked it 50 minutes and refrigerated it (covered tightly). The next day, I warmed it 20 minutes at 250 and 10 minutes at 350 until the edges bubbled a bit. It was a huge hit. Next time I will use real mozzarella cheese and shred it myself, but this time I didn't have the energy for that. I think it will make it a 6 star if it has real cheese instead of the prepacked shredded cheese, which has fillers. This photo is a bit deceptive. My pan was filled to the top. 
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#Made this today for all of my family..Everyone loved it! Thanks for sharing the recipe?
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#I have been making this recipe for years, year-round. It can't be beat. When I don't have ricotta it's still wonderful. 
Traditional Lasagna#3#0#Finally I have an amazing lasagna recipe. Made this just recently and everyone raved. I had leftovers the next day and it even tasted better. And Emily I'm sorry but you had to do something wrong to give it negative reviews. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#7#This is a disaster too long cooking waste of time and money.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I can't wait for Christmas! I will surely prepare this lasagna for dinner with the use of bentilia to substitute the noddles used for healthier Christmas eve dinner, and of course to enjoy the dinner without hearing the kids complain. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Can this dish be made the night before??
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#Really great traditional recipe! Exactly what you need when you want a true down home Lasagna recipe!
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#This is my go-to lasagna. I really like the sauce. I use mild Italian sausage instead of bulk pork sausage and usually make a double recipe. I save the extra to use on spaghetti. It's a great recipe for entertaining. I make all the components ahead and just assemble and bake. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I make mine the same way you do only I don't use any ricotta cheese, it makes it to dry for my taste. 
Traditional Lasagna#1#2#This is a very good recipe but I've now made it several times with and without the sausage and we think it's better without the sausage since it's less greasy. I just add a little of the traditional, sausage spices to the grind beef and increase the ground beef (lean) proportionately. We make it about nice a month these day, sometimes more often in winter. 
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#My first time making lasagna. I followed the recipe except I used store bought spaghetti sauce. My family really enjoyed this dish.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#How do you freeze this, cooked or uncooked.????
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#Always a hit with this recipe. It also freezes well.
Traditional Lasagna#2#1#I've made this lasagna several times now. Love it! Last night I served it to my dinner guests, and even the person who said he HATED lasagna ate a great big helping. This really does make a lot, so I suggest that you use a nice deep lasagna pan. I made some simple additions to suit our tastes: a half cup of diced onions sauteed with the meat, a 10 ounce jar of sliced mushrooms (drained), and I increased the sausage to one pound. I also increased the tomato sauce to 30 ounces. Extra mozzarella on every layer. Perfecto! Helpful hints: Add the top layer of cheese after you uncover the lasagna so it doesn't stick to the foil. And in response to several questions about the sausage, recommendations are to use ground Italian sausage, NOT pork breakfast sausage or sausage links. I made the mistake of using pork breakfast sausage the first time I made this and the taste totally overwhelmed it. Yikes 
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#I absolutely Love it!!!! Ive made this the first time with beef and mild italian sausage, this time i used ground turkey and mild italian sausage i actuallu think i liked it better this time(and i normally Hate ground turkey) I did tweek it though. Instead of mozzarella and provolone I use a 5 or 6 cheese Italian blend. I also use sharp, Jack and Colby. I use 15 ounces of ricotta and two eggs instead of three. Today I added a little chicken broth to loosen it up a bit. It wasn't soupy!!!! The seasonings I changed up a bit too, in addition to Italian I used a complete sazon seasoning, and adobo. CLassico traditional sause and diced tomatoes with oregano and Basil. I Sauteed garlic and shallots. I love love love the cottage cheese, it gives the ricotta a little kick. I must now use that cheese mixture in some homemade ravioli!!!!!! Yummmm 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Okay so I substituted garlic for the powder. And also the beef for ground turkey and instead of spicy sausage I used mild and it was great well the meat sauce. I have my lasagna in the ovenext right now but I'm sure it'll be great. :) 
Traditional Lasagna#0#2#Very good Lasagna, I used ground turkey instead of hamburger and could not tell the difference. I missed the ricotta cheese but the recipe was quite good without it. My 9x13 pan was full without the ricotta. I also had 2 cups of extra sauce left over.
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#This lasagna is really yummy, I substituted spicy Italian sausage and a bottle of garlic meat tomato sauce instead of plain tomato sauce. As well as Italian flavored tomato paste since I dont have Italian seasoning. One thing that I blundered on was the garlic. Ive never cooked with garlic before so I accidently put 2 whole garlic bulbs instead of 2 cloves so it was very garlicy. Still yummy though and would be 10x better with the recipe amount. Im on my mobile and the star selection is acting up so in case it doesnt say this- 5 stars for this lasagna!
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#Made this for my son's soccer team, and again for a dinner party with my husband's work colleagues, and both times I received rave reviews for this dish. Even my picky 9-year old loved this lasagna. This will be my go-to recipe for lasagna! 
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#This is the best lasagna I have ever eaten. It took a little time to put together but it was worth every minute to assemble
Traditional Lasagna#0#1#This recipe is very good added a few ingredients to this recipe, I added 1/4 cup of fried fennel, 1/2 cup of caramelized onion, a pound if fried muhrooms and some extra virgin Olive oil and 2 14 oz cans of fire roasted dice tomatoes, I only used one small can of tomato pasteTurned out excellent with a very zesty taste to the sauce -----YUM
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#I made this for my husband's birthday, and the family loved it. My sons-in-law wanted seconds and some to take home. I made two recipes worth so that I could do that. I'm thankful that the note said that the pan would be full ; I was concerned, but it fit and there was no boil over. I especially enjoyed the layer of provolone cheese; that was something I had not seen in any other recipe. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This recipe is very similar to one called My Famous Cheesy, Heavy-duty Lasagna . The one difference is the meat. I used 1 1/2 lbs. ground chuck and 1/4 lb. bulk Italian pork sausage with 1/2 diced onion added to the meats then drained off the grease. I also used 3-16oz cans Hunts tomato sauce and 1 6oz. can tomato paste. I used 2 tsp. of Italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp. salt. For the cheese I used a 16 oz. block of mozzarella-shredded by hand instead of the 12 oz. in the recipe. I also added a pkg. of Kraft Italian 5-cheese finely grated to the top when it is uncovered. I baked at 350 degrees for 60 minutes, then uncovered and baked 15 minutes more with the added cheese. This is a very good lasagna recipe, but be sure to bake in a lasagna pan as it does not fit into a 13 X 9 pan! 
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#My husband made this Lasagna last night and it was SO delicious and by far the best lasagna we have ever eaten - other recipes don't even come close! We have 3 young children who all raved over it and our daughter even brought some to school in her thermos for lunch. It made plenty for a family of 5 - still have a few pieces left over but they won't make it till the end of the day! My husband ate 3 pieces for dinner on his own! Grab some Italian bread and make this recipe - you'll be so happy you did! 10 YUMMY STARS!!!! :) 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I am a terrible cook and I found this to be easy and delicious! I would definitely recommend it!
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#Best I ever made or ate.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Made it for Canada Day - my guests loved it!
Traditional Lasagna#3#0#I had doubts that this was going to turn out because the sauce ended up very thick. It was almost like a paste, and I wasn't even able to simmer it for the whole hour because I was afraid it was going to burn. However, the lasagna still tasted excellent even with the very thick sauce. I think the next time, I will maybe use a can of diced tomatoes in place of one of the cans of sauce. Also, I would wait to add the last layer of mozzarella cheese until after you uncover it, because most of the top layer of cheese ended up on the foil when I removed it. I also used the no-cook noodles for this, and they came out great! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This is the best lasagna I have ever had! I use the no cook noodles and it's great ! 
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#I hadn't made lasagna in a very long time so I decided to look up a recipe. I tried this one and it came out excellent. Based on the other reviews, I did add 2 lbs of meat (I used ground turkey instead of beef) instead of 1lb. and therefore used twice the amount of tomato sauce to compensate for the extra meat. I also used a deeper pan and made 3 layers instead of two. Everyone thought it was delicious and I will definitely make it again. Thanks! 
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#I've been making this recipe for years & i always get request for the recipe. I found a cheese maker that makes extra sharp provolone cheese.If you can find it it's well worth using in this recipe. It gives it sharper bite & tang you don't get with regular provolone 
Traditional Lasagna#2#0#Best ever! Pauline, Nova Scotia
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#Made this for my date this weekend and it was amazing. He doesn't eat red meat so I replaced the ground beef with Morning Star Crumbles and replaced the pork sausage with Morningstar Farms Original Sausage. Bought all Horizon cheeses and made it completely'humane' (animals used in recipe were organically fed, free range, and humanely slaughtered). It was delicious!!! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#EX !!!!!.
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#YUM! Perfect recipe! Thank you! This was my first lasanga attempt! Your recipe was flawless!
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#Best lasagna ever!
Traditional Lasagna#2#0#This is hands down, the best lasagna I've ever tried. My family is crazy about it. Wonderful recipe!! 
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#Made this for the first time tonight and loved it with a few changes. Made the meat my own way; adding onions, peppers and garlic to the meat and sausage mix and instead of tomato sauce and paste, I used a large jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce, which cut down the prep time. The rest I followed exactly. I let it rest for about 1 hour, before cutting into it and just reheated pieces in the microwave. This was a real hit at my home and I had plenty left over for the next day. Definitely will be making this again and may try adding hard boiled eggs to the meat this time.
Traditional Lasagna#3#1#This lasagna was awesome if you are a cheese lover this is the recipe for you. I added chopped onion and mushrooms in and let them saute with the meat because I like more than just meat in my sauce and the flavor was to die for! Hands down best lasagna I have ever made:)
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I've made at least 50 different versions of lasagna, this is hands down, the best by far. I followed the recipe. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Yummy!!! My family requests this at least once a month if not twice. Love it!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This is by far the best lasagna I have ever made, and quite possibly the best I've ever eaten (restaurants included!) One thing I really like about the recipe is the step-by-step layering directions. They make it very easy to put this delicious dish together! 
Traditional Lasagna#2#8#Horrible recipe. I am actually quite surprised it turned out so horribly. I spent $30 on all the ingredients and almost knew it would turn out amazing due to all the great reviews and five star rating. There was not nearly enough sauce to call it lasagna. The flavors were way too strong and the pork sausage was the wrong choice. There was also not enough lasagna noodles in this recipe. So many things I didn't like about this dish. What a waste of food and time. Don't waste your time. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This is absolutely delicious. Only change I did was use half cottage cheese and half ricotta of the total 32 ounces of both.
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#wonderful lasagna, I too used oven ready lasagna perfect!
Traditional Lasagna#0#1#DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO COOK THE LASAGNA NOODLES ! THEY TURN OUT JUST FINE....
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This was easy to make and SO good.....it's a keeper ! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I must say, I was surprised how well this turned out. Every lasagna recipe I've ever tried always came out on the flavorless side, but this recipe did not. Everyone was surprised that there was cottage cheese in the lasagna, which I feel helps the taste. Granted, I had to adjust the ingredients a little since a person in my family has sensitivities to what is in Italian seasoning, but a pepper and onion sausage and a little extra salt and sugar did the trick with the sauce.Definitely a keeper. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Oh my gosh, is this good! Love the layer of provolone! And this is the first time I made lasagna with both cottage and ricotta cheese. I added a little more ricotta than the recipe calls for, and it turned out sooooooo good! This is my new lasagna recipe!
Traditional Lasagna#0#1#There were 8 of us for dinner and we finished the entire pan! DH asked if we could make it again in January. We used sweet italian sausage, a 29 oz can of tomato sauce, and an additional 15 oz can of diced tomatoes. We did have some sauce that wouldn't fit in the pan, however, so the extra sauce and tomatoes were probably not necessary. We'll probably do it as written next time. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#My picky husband rated this an 8 out of 10, and this says a lot! Based on the reviews, I added a can of diced tomatoes with its juice; it was perfect!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This was fantastic! I didnt add any salt, but other than that, I didn't change a thing. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Super salty. Next time I will not add the salt the recipe calls for and I'll also use no salt added tomato sauce and paste. I think minus the over salty taste this would be really good. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#It's still in the oven, but am I the only one who thought there wasn't enough meat mixture in one cup to cover the bottom of the 9x13 baking dish? 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I liked this recipe and would have given it a 5-star rating, but the meat sauce was too dry. I added a cup of beef broth during the last half hour and it was fine.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#THE best lasagna I've ever made or eaten! A perfect 10 from the whole family :) 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I've been making lasagna for over 40 years for my family, but decided to update the taste and ran across this recipe in Taste of Home a couple years ago. I use this recipe exclusively now. It's very meaty with the beef and pork and that is the best combination. The seasoning and combination of cheeses is perfect. I had my doubts about the use of cottage cheese, but it cooks down so there are no curds and keeps the lasagna from drying out. I made this a number of times and it comes out perfect every time. I call that foolproof!! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#My husband and I really loved this lasagna. The only change I will make is to cut down on the cheese.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I usually go with jar sauce to save time, but wanted to make an extra special dinner for family staying with me. This recipe was awesome, so good, they could not stop bragging. Thank you Taste of Home!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Made this for dinner last night; I must say one of the Best lasagna I have ever had or made. Followed the recipe, with few changes; added 2/3 cup red wine to the sauce to make it a little more saucier and used no cook lasagna noodles. The second time I made it, had my in laws visiting so made it the day before and took it out of the fridge 4 hours before baking, still as AWESOME as the first time & using the no cook lasagna noodles. This is a keeper in my recipe book.Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe with all of us.Ferryal
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Made this for dinner tonight.... It was awesome!!!!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I have a question do you remove the skins from the sausages or cook them whole or cut up
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Loved it! My boyfriend said it was the best lasagna he's ever had and that's saying something! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I've made this delicious recipe before and am going to try making five trays of it this weekend for a big gathering. This time I'm going to try oven-ready lasagna noodles to save time. Keeping my fingers crossed that it will work. Has anyone else tried these noodles? 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#My family loved this lasagna! So so so good!!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Best lasagna in the world!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I just followed the recipe as given and it was a big hit. I might try a little more of the meat sauce next time.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Perfect.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I used 2 lbs of hamburger, 1 lb of Italian sausage and added an additional 15 oz. of tomato sauce. My family loved it, in fact my husband said this is the best dish ever! Will definitely make it again.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I am coming back online again to get this recipe. I have tried other recipes over the years but always come back to this one when I am having company and want my lasagna to taste just right!
Traditional Lasagna#0#1#Just began creating this dish, I've never made lasagna by myself before so I'm hoping my dad and younger sisters enjoy this for dinner tonight! (Did not have cottage cheese so I doubled up on ricotta... Also did not have provolone :( hopefully it's still good!) 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I too have tried for years to get the perfect lasagna. I found this one last winter and have been making it exactly as it says since. I printed it off and laminated it. I have been asked many times to share it. I always have some in the freezer now. It is so easy to freeze. I wait until the next day and cut it to portion sizes and wrap them individual in saran and then place them in a ziplock bag in freezer. I often share these portions with seniors and shut-ins.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#The ricotta cheese is what makes this dish so fantastic. I love to add additional shredded cheese, however, on the top! Delicious. This also freezes well.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I first tried this recipe from my Taste of Home cookbook a few years back. It has become a family favorite!! It really is easy to make and has such great flavor. I make it a few times during the year. especially during the cold winter months. I've also tried it with jar sauce but It's just not the same I've also used my own homemade sauce from cooking down tomatoes which is to die for!!! I loaned my cookbook to my SIL and have not gotten it back yet so I'm so glad it's included in the online recipes. My husband has been craving the best lasagna ever as he calls it. he's so right. definitely a 5 star recipe 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#After 44 years of trying to make my husband happy with lasagna, I finally nailed it. I didnt make the sauce sunce Prego is our favorite ( I have made many home made sauces in my cooking career) and we always go back to Prego. It saves time in the kitchen. I used Asiago-Parmesan instead of just Pamesan. EXCELLENT
Traditional Lasagna#0#1#I added some V-8 juice as needed to thin the sauce while it simmered for the hour. I added onion, green pepper, fresh mushrooms, bay leaf, extra garlic, and Italian seasoning. And towards the end of the hour, some fresh basil.To the layers I added one of fresh spinach. I am SO glad I found this recipe! I have made it twice, once with beef and sausage, and once with beef and plain ground pork. Both were awesome! Thank you for this recipe!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I made this for New Year's Day dinner and it was a hit! This will be my go to recipe for lasagna. I had Italian sausage so used that instead of the pork sausage and it turned out great. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Easy to fix. The sauce had good flavor.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#AWESOME. Quick and easy and very filling. The taste is what made my family a lasagna lover.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I first made this recipe for a New Year's Day gathering of family & friends in 2010, & it was a hit with everyone! I substituted 4 cups of Ragu Traditional Spaghetti Sauce for the tomato sauce mixture in order to save time. I also occasionally substitute sliced or bulk pepperoni for the bulk pork sausage. We enjoy the variety of cheeses; I'd never seen that before. It's a favorite! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I made this yesterday because my in-laws were coming, and everyone liked it a lot! I didn't change anything, except I used dried parsley instead of fresh (didn't have fresh). A definite keeper! Even my extremely picky 12-year-old cleaned her plate! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This was a truly delicious lasagna. I used hot Italian sausage because my family likes a bit of kick in their meals, but there is really nothing I would change about this recipe. It is definitely a keeper.
Traditional Lasagna#0#1#I am still in the process of making this so my star rating is not really fair. However, I am confused. I went out yesterday and carefully selected all of the ingredients. If you look at the ingredients list there is no mention of provolone; then when you get to step 3 you are supposed to layer with provolone. Provolone is similar to mozzarella, but the instructions call for provolone AND mozzarella. Note the recipe also calls for 1/2 c of Parmesan cheese. No where in the instructions is that ingredient mentioned. Finally, the sauce is to be simmered for one hour. Unless you want it burned, don't plan on that. It is very thick and I had to stop with nine minutes to go. Obviously this recipe was not kitchen-tested. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#the best
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Best Lasagna Recipe that I have found.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#By FAR the best lasagna I've ever eaten. The whole family loved it. Takes some time to make, but so worth it! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Yep - as good as everyone says.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Wow--delicious! Made it for a party everyone loved it!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Awesome recipe. It is the only one I use now.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This was a great recipe!! It was easy to make and came out soooo good! Everyone loved it. Next time, I'll use hot sausage instead of sweet. The sauce was tasty and it was the perfect amount of ricotta. Definitely let the sauce cook for an hour or more; it makes a huge difference. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#The very best! I used 1 1/2 #ground beef and 1/2 #sausage. Also added 1/2 c water and used 1/2 t garlic powder instead of cloves (not a garlic fan). No changes necessary...just my taste. My dinner guests agreed it's the best ever!!! Once cut, it stays in layers nicely, too. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Excellent! I cut out the sausage and used all ground beef. This turned out perfect!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Excellent recipe and easy to make. Shared it with 3 friends and they were amazed and said This is what I call a real lasagna recipe . Of course I will continue making it. Thumbs up! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Great Lasagna! I used home made noodles for this dish. Super flavor and not difficult to prepare. Will definitely have again.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I have not made this recipe but it sounds like a great way to make the cottage cheese mix in the lasagna. 5 stars for creativity. I can not wait to make it for my family.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#It is everything I want in a lasagna. Everyone in my family loves it.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Sooo yummy... The sausage made for a wonderful flavor and I love how the sauce is simmered for an hour to get it nice and thick. A lot of lasagna turns out wet and runny. This one is perfect! Even my insanely picky husband liked it!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I really enjoyed this recipe. I felt that that the combination of ingrediants were great, however, I was not happy with the sauce itself. I felt it was a little overwhelming and I am interested in other people's comments and suggestions about the sauce. I just felt it was a little too thick and too overpowering. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I made this for Christmas dinner & got so many compliments! The only change I made was I used 1 pound of Italian sausage & 1/2 pound of ground beef. So yummy! The leftovers didn't last long! You can't fail with this recipe. I made it the day before & let the flavors mingle overnight. Then baked it the next day. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This was absolutely delicious! I added a touch of fine grated cheddar cheese with the mozzarella and used italian sausage. Served this dish for Christmas as everyone was tired of ham and turkey. My kids said this will be the new Christmas tradition at our house!!!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This is my go-to recipe. I've been making it for years, and it's even my in-law family's favorite (and they are Sicilian Italian!). I usually do the beef/sausage combo, but I prefer just beef. I always try to use all fresh ingredients, including fresh mozzerella! Sometimes I will make it with just ricotta, but it's great both ways! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I made this tonight for my family. My kids just loved it! I had to make it Gluten Free with the no boil Gluten Free noodles. I think next time I will only use ground beef though. Other than that, this is a great recipe!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#My go to lasagna dish. So good. No one has disliked it. Had to use all beef for some who can not eat pork and added saute onions.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I have been making this recipe since it first came out in Taste of Home over a decade ago. The only changes I've made over the years is to use a mix of hot & sweet Italian sausage, plus I add about 1/4 jar prepared sauce to thin sauce just a bit. On occasion when I have extra fresh basil, I'll add with parsley to cheese/egg mixture. I always receive rave compliments with this dish. PS I make a double batch and freeze one for the future. No better recipe!!! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Best lasagna recipe I have found. I will definitely make this again.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This recipe is delicious! My whole family loved it!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Hello Lorri, thank you so much for such a wonderful, flavorful, and tasty lasagna. This is the best recipe. It's so good that I decided to make it for 150 people for my husbands customer appreciation night . WOW, what was I thinking, Ha! The lasagna was a big hit but, I learned my lesson- if I don't have a double oven (which I don't) and have a couple of friends to help me I'll never attempt it again. I ended up making 8 pans, whew! But it was all good, thanks again! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Excellent! I used itaillan sausage and 50/50 ratio of cottage & ricotta. Everybody Loves!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This recipe is by far the best lasagna I've eatten, and I'm not much of a lasagna person. I made the recipe as-is the first time, and the second time, I tweaked it for a healthier version (no meat, so no simmering of the sauce ahead of time, reduced-fat ricotta cheese, reduced fat provolone, and a mix of 2% mozzarella and regular shredded mozzarella). It still tasted fantastic! Definitely making this again! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I add a few more seasonings, but this is excellent!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I'm making it right now :D 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#The BEST lasagna I have ever had! I did use italian sausage instead of plain, but that was the only change I made. So good!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This is my second rating of this recipe. This time, I left out the sausage and only used hamburger meat. I loved it this way and got many great comments too. I would have increased my star rating from 3 to 5 but website won't let me change my rating 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#My husband loved this recipe. I have never used provolone in lasagna before. It was great. We have tried adding torn spinach as one of the layers, comes out great.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I used all ground beef instead of part pork sausage...and we loved it. Seems I've been a short order cook around here with picky requests from kids, but my seven and four year old oohed and ahhed over something this amazing. Made a batch for my in-laws who believed this was the best lasagna they've tasted. Completely worth the effort and extra time to put together. Will be making this again soon. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I loved this recipe, I think it may be my go to lasagna recipe from now on. I used 1 pound of pork sausage, dried parsley, and only simmered the pasta sauce for 30 minutes. I recommend using a lasagna pan for this recipe, as the 9x13 is too small. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Everyone in my family loved this recipe!This is a keeper!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This is VERY good! The only tweak I made, was to add minced onions and a bay leaf to the meat sauce. Perfection!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#We LOVED this recipe. It turned out beautiful. The only thing I did different was I didn't simmer the sauce for 60min instead I simmered it for 30min. Also during the browning process I only did it for 15min instead of 20. I'm planning on making this for my parents this weekend. Thanks so much for the recipe. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Simply delicious! Everyone loved it!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I had not made lasagna in a while and saw this recipe. I am so glad I did! It's easy and heartily delicious! I will definitely make this again. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Everyone in my family loves this recipe; my mom even asked me for a copy because she likes it better than her's! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I followed recipe exactly and it was very good, but I definitely will cut back on the garlic next time.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This is my family's tradition now. I make this every Christmas eve, and everybody enjoys it. I do not think it is difficult to make or time consuming. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#It requires a bit of work, but totally worth it!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Made this for the family. Everyone raved about it. I followed the recipe exactly. Very good
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Just tried this the other night. Unbelievably good. Everyone loved it.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This has been my go to lasagna recipe since I discovered it in Taste of Home years ago. I also use the sauce recipe for pasta.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This was fun to make and delicious.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I have been making this recipe since it was first published eleven years ago. People always enjoy it. Even my Italian mother-in-law likes it! Very easy recipe too. Highly recommend!
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#Awesome lasagna that makes even better leftovers! Well worth the time & effort!
Traditional Lasagna#1#0#Three people in my family found this recipe at around the same time. The entire family agrees that this is the best lasagna recipe available. I don't know that it would be considered a traditional lasagna by Italian standards but we do not care it is our favorite. Easy to prepare and has the best of all lasagna recipes included in the ingredients! I tend to add my own touches to recipes as I make them, but not with this one;no improvements needed. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I love this lasagna!!! Just LOVE it! So does everyone else in my family.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I have made this lasagna for years. No other lasagna compares to this one. I follow the recipe to the letter every time and it turns out perfectly every time.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I have made this lasagna several times and always get great reviews. I use venison meat instead of beef! Simply because it is what we have on hand.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#SO DELICIOUS!!! No other lasagna even comes close to this one.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I have made this several times and always get tons of compliments. Sauce is delicious.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#The very best
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#One word.... Delicious
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Absolutely wonderful!!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Good like it is. I'm leaving this one alone! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Deliciously cheesy.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Best lasagna I've ever made. My fiance always tells me all my other lasagna recipes have been bland, but he loved this one. Gonna make it again this week! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#We LOVE this lasagna. We do all beef since we're not big sausage fans. It's so delicious and has ruined us to other lasagna's. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I have made this lasagne many times.It is wonderful but not everyone likes sausage.I replaced the sausage with ground pork and it was excellent.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Made this for my neighbors and they swore it was the best lasagna that they have ever had.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Before trying this recipe, I have always made the same family recipe I had watched my parents make for years. I never have liked many other recipes....well, I saw how popular this recipe is here, so I tried it. AMAZINGLY GOOD!! I am afraid to tell my parents for fear of hurting their feelings! The only thing I did differently (because of lack of exact ingredients) was to substitute pizza sauce for the tomato sauce and replaced the italian seasoning with a mixture of basil and oregano. It was the best lasagna I have ever eaten. I will probably cut back on the sauce a bit next time. This lasagna is everything everyone says it is. Perfecto!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This is my second rating of this recipe. This time, I left out the sausage and only used hamburger meat. I loved it this way and got many great comments too. I would have increased my star rating from 3 to 5 but website won't let me change my rating 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#The meat sauce ended up very thick but still delicious! I left out the provolone and used dried parsley instead of fresh. Also, I used an aluminum lasagna pan so overflow wasn't a problem. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#The prep time on this dish was a little more than I expected (I will admit that I didn't read the recipe closely at first), but the lasagna was worth the wait! It's a mild flavored dish, sure not to offend anyone. We enjoyed it, but I'll probably add spinach and mushrooms next time to add a little more interest. All in all, it's definitely something I'd serve to the in-laws. :) 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#WOW! This will be my Lasagna recipe that I will always use! So GOOD!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This was a HUGE hit. This is the best lasagna recipe.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I absolutely LOVE this recipe!!! It's soooo filling and delicious that it is also a hit when I make this for parties or dinner! Definitely worth the time to put this all together for my friends and family! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Best lasagna I have ever made.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Love it, love it, and love it. I took this Lasagna to a pot luck and it was the hit of the night. I didn't change a thing. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#i love lasagne!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#The is the best lasagne recipe ever. I had my Family over and wanted to try a new recipe that would feed a large group. Lots of compliments and asking where I got the recipe. Really easy but kind of long process to make. Followed the recipe exactly as written. Will definately make this one again,soon.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This was the lasagna recipe that I have been looking for!! Great flavor and cheesy! This recipe is a winner (yes it is a blue ribbon contest winner!!) I use 1/2 hot Italian and 1/2 mild Italian sausage for the port sausage. SO GOOD!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#this is a family favorite! I don't like chunks of tomatoes so this is a winner! Sometimes I add pepperoni as well. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This is a fantastic lasagna. I used a foil pan so it wouldn't spill on the way to my in-laws. It did not dry out at all. I would make this again. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This was the best Lasagna I have ever made. It was wonderful. I had family over for dinner and they loved it.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#My boyfriend always orders lasagna from the Olive Garden. This recipe was a big hit with him -- he thought it was better than the Olive Garden. Very delicious!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Delicious! This recipe is great and easy. The only thing I had to change was the cooking time. Since I made it earlier in the day, it had been in the refrigerator so I took longer than the 50 minutes to cook. So just make sure you adjust your cooking time, if needed. But a really delicious recipe.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#GREAT LASAGNA!! One of the best..If not the best..
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This is an excellent recipe. This is also the first SUCCESSFUL lasagna recipe that I have made. My guy absolutely LOVED it. The only thing I did was double the sauce and the amount of mozarella. There was plenty of sauce left over to make a small lasagna, or to use for spaghetti sauce.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I made this for my husband tonight. He was speechless and let me say THAT doesn't happen very often. Tasted great. Will definitely make again. Will love the leftovers it gave us. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Very good. It will be the only lasagna I will ever make from now on.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I made it two times already and everyone loves it. This sat. i'm making it again for a bridal shower i'm hosting. Thank you 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This recipe is a keeper! I was looking for some new ideas to enhance my usual way of making Lasagna. I really likes all the reviews of this recipe and I liked the ingredients. WOW! This is really good. I made the tomato sauce a day ahead of time and it tasted sooooo good ( I could hardly leave it alone!) Only changes I made were adding 2 extra garlic cloves and using Jenno's hot italian sausage in place of the sausage. This is now my new recipe. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#The best home made lasagna ever!!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I have made this a number of times. This is the best lasagna recipe I have come across so far. I have been making this recipe for years.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This is the best lasagna recipe I have come across....I have modified it a bit when I make it. I only use one can of tomato paste I feel that when you use two it has too much of a metallic taste (especially when eating leftovers) and it also makes the sauce too thick and reheated leftovers are too dry. I also use slightly more tomato sauce and use two 15 oz cans of sauce. I am not a huge sausage fan so I usually omit the sausage and just use the 1 lb of beef.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#good recipe-but to saucy for me, next time will cut sauce back
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I made this recipe for a family get-together. Everyone said it was fantastic, and I even got phone calls the next day about it. I followed the recipe exactly, as I wanted to see what I'd change. Not a thing! I'll never make another recipe after this. It takes extra time, but it's well worth it. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I make this lasagna on special occasions two or three times a year and every time I make it, I get rave reviews. It takes patience but it's well worth it. Also, the recipe freezes well. I put mine in an 11x17 pan because its too much for a 9x13. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Great recipe!!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I made this lasagna for a small family get-together. It was really good but it is not a throw-together-at-the-last-minute recipe. But I would definitely make it again!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I've made this many times. It's fantastic. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This was the first Lasagna recipe I've ever made. I 2lbs of ground chuck instead of ground beef and pork sausage and it turned out great! Wonderful Recipe! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#It was amazing, my whole family loved it and my 4 yr old ask if we could have it every day!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Delicious. I added chopped zucchini, green peppers and mushrooms to the sauce.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I tried this recipe yesterday for dinner. My husband and family said it was delicious maybe, the best lasagna he has eaten.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This is the best lasagna recipe I have ever had. I will not make anything else. Make sure you put a piece of foil or a cookie sheet under the baking dish because this is filled to the brim and tends to overflow.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This is the best lasagna I have ever made. I didn't have any pork sausage meat so I used ground pork. This is the recipe I will always make. 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This is the best lasagna recipe I have found. It's AMAZING!! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Every time I have dinner guests, this is my go-to recipe. If I have any left, it also freezes well for later. I also make mine in a larger pan to avoid overflow in my oven.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This recipe is by far the best that I have ever used! I don't think I will ever use another lasagna recipe again! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#My friends and I agree that by far this is the best lasagna we have ever had. I double the recipe and make them two at a time. They freeze well uncooked.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I have made this recipe for several holiday meals and also on Sunday meals. I get many compliments and it is the best lasagna recipe I have ever made. My husband always orders lasagna when we eat out and he said this recipe tops them all.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#MY FAMILY LOVED THIS RECIPE!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#My absolute favorite! I usually make a double batch to freeze one pan for later!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Awesome!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This recipe really is as fabulous as everyone says! Wanted to make vegetarian lasagna for my neighbor so substituted the meat for boca crumbles and boca sausage crumbled. I love meat and I never would have known that it was vegetarian. The flavor and textures were amazing. Truly the perfect lasagna!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#very tasty! not hard to make. I used the kind of noodles you dont need to boil before baking. good for one less step :)
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Amazingly good! My family prefers this recipe over my Italian-born mother-in-law's! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This is the best lasagna recipe I have found. The meat sauce and cheeses compliment each other very well.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#My entire family uses this recipe anytime that lasagna is craved! We all discovered this recipe several years ago and stopped looking for any other lasagna recipe. The only thing we look for now is to see which one of us is going to prepare the dish next. Love it!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#never made lasagna b4, this one reminded me of ones i grew up on! (I leave the sausage out, and use pre-made spaghetti sauce). Tastes amazing, everyone loves it! it's a crowd pleaser!! 
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Love this recipe, it has become a constant go to and the family loves it!
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#I made this for the second time yesterday for my boyfriend and his roommates. Everyone loved it! It is by far my favorite lasagna recipie.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#Dear Lorri,Thank you for this recipe. I have made it every Christmas Eve for our family get-together ever since it was first published in Taste of Home magazine. Everyone loves it. And I love getting kudos for making it!Debbie B.
Traditional Lasagna#0#0#This has been our favorite lasagna recipe for years!!!
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#I made this for dinner tonight and it was excellen
Cauliflower Soup#4#0#This is a keeper. I couldn't decide whether to use vegetable vs chicken bouillon so did 1tsp of each. The tsp of hot sauce is NOT optional in my opinion, it's a must. And no, it doesn't make it spicy at all. I also added maybe an 1/8-1/4 tsp dry mustard (to give it that background kick like in beer cheese soup), 1/4 cup diced onion and 2 cloves crushed garlic into the veggies. I used sharp cheddar for the most flavor & it came out perfect. Normally I'm always adding extra salt or bouillon to most soups but didn't need to with this one. It was plenty thick without blending any of the veggies.
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#Always looking for a healthy soup that will be suitable for my gluten-free friend and my diabetic friend. This was a winner. Easy to make (hardest part was breaking up the cauliflower) and delicious. 
Cauliflower Soup#11#6#My granny god bless her use to serve this up to me decades ago and said its a poor man's soup. I made it myself today and was surprised how it tasted exactly the same as my granny made. I also added whatever I had and put some sharp tasting parmesan cheese with the other shredded cheese I had and the taste was spectacular. 
Cauliflower Soup#12#4#This is a nice tasting cauliflower soup. I really liked it and will make again.
Cauliflower Soup#50#13#I've been making this soup for several years now. I have added a chopped onion and a whole rotisserie chicken cut into bite sized pieces. With the added ingredients I increase the water to at least 4 cups. I do like the idea of adding red pepper flakes for added flavor. My family loves this recipe.
Cauliflower Soup#22#4#This is one of those comforting, cozy kind of soups. My family and I were very sick with Covid a few months ago. I was staying with my 19 month old grandson because my daughter and her husband were in the hospital having my granddaughter and due to some complications on top of them also having Covid, I was with him for almost a week. Many people dropped off meals and groceries for us. I was so nauseated with the sickness and couldn't eat much of anything. My son-in-law's mom made this for me using almond milk and it very much hit the spot. It is literally all I could eat for days. I have made it exactly as written and it was delicious with both milks.
Cauliflower Soup#10#4#Simple & excellent recipe! I see a lot of comments saying it was bland, I definitely disagree. I know it says hot pepper sauce optional, I would add it for sure. I used Frank's Red Hot.
Cauliflower Soup#15#4#Don't let the name fool you, this is terrific! Even though it is cauliflower instead of potato this soup is very tasty and easy to prepare. I made it for Christmas dinner and was told by multiple guests that they loved it too. 
Cauliflower Soup#7#1#I added bacon bits, chili flakes and 2 tsp Franks hot sauce. Turned out delicious with so much flavour!I also mashed the caulflower before adding the cheese sauce. Definitely recommend this recipe! Yummmm
Cauliflower Soup#1#15#This was pretty bland. I had added 2 diced chicken breasts and extra black pepper & even some Korean chili powder but that was not enough. What really helped was sprinkling some green onions over the top of the soup after serving.
Cauliflower Soup#11#0#Excellent recipe!!! I added bacon bits and now it tastes like loaded baked potato in soup form!
Cauliflower Soup#7#4#I make this soup every winter. It is one of my husband & mine favorite. I try to use also low fat cheddar or sharp cheese to cut more fat. I also use sodium reduce better than bouillon. If I have broccoli leftover from a prior dinner or have fresh will add it too.
Cauliflower Soup#8#0#Very very good. I added half cream and half milk instead of just the milk a bit more pepper and used medium white cheddar and half a medium onion very very small chopped. This is now one of my favorites. Thank-you. JP
Cauliflower Soup#12#10#I made this recipe exactly as recipe said. I tasted it and it was really really good. I husband wanted cauliflower soup and this was the best. Don't leave out the celery because that really adds a lot of flavor. I am on a kick of using almond milk because it's healthier than cream or half and half and it can stay in my fridge for 2 months whereas milk products need to be used. The almond milk tastes no different. The only thing I noticed was that it made so little soup. So my review already said the recipe as stated is very good....BUT I added 2 potatoes, cooked, drained and mashed with a little butter and added to the soup with 2 cups of water and 1 T. soup base and 1 more cup of cheese.......When I go to the work of making a soup, I want more than just a couple meals for the 2 of us. 
Cauliflower Soup#23#3#Very tasty. Sautéed veggies in EVOO and added onion and garlic. Added a little paprika and dry mustard. Pressure cooked everything non dairy for 5 minutes and a 10 min natural release. Made the roux according to directions and folded it in. Total hit. Next time I think I may add a splash of white wine or sherry and a potato.
Cauliflower Soup#6#2#Absolutely delicious!
Cauliflower Soup#73#6#I really liked this recipe and so did most of my family. I did make a few minor changes however. First, I sauteed onion in olive oil, added the shredded carrot and cauliflower florets and sauteed for a few minutes with the onion. Then I added chicken stock instead of water. After I added the cheese sauce to the cauliflower, I used my immersion blender to make a more creamy thick soup. I have bookmarked this soup and will definitely make it again.
Cauliflower Soup#28#5#I made this tonight! I also chopped up an onion with the other veggies.. it just feels wrong to cook without onions. I sautéed the veggies A little bit with olive oil and Epicure rosemary garlic seasoning. Then added in chicken broth instead of the water. To finish I added in some buffalo hot sauce.... so good! I will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.
Cauliflower Soup#15#4#I just made this soup and it is absolutely delicious. Made one change, used vegetable broth instead of water to cook the vegetables. It was so good I subscribed to the magazine.
Cauliflower Soup#9#0#Just made this tasty soup with the addition of dijon mustard and a small potato - very satisfying with warm crusty bread.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Everyone who has had this, enjoys it.
Cauliflower Soup#7#37#This recipe is a place to start. Hard to imagine how boring it would be as written. We roasted the vegetables. Added sauteed onion and a list of seasonings; onion powder, basil, marjoram, white pepper, paprika and made it a little thicker and it was very good.
Cauliflower Soup#2#0#This is absolutely my favorite. Kids think it's bland but I love it!! I did add the hot sauce and put more in than required. So good. 
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#Liz, I made it last night and used almond milk. My husband loved it.
Cauliflower Soup#7#1#I am eating leftover soup and just realized what`s missing. It needs a pinch of dry mustard!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Has anyone tried this with a milk substitute like almond milk. I love creamy soups but family can have milk
Cauliflower Soup#4#0#I'm glad I read the review of course I used what everyone before me did I sautéed onion, garlic, Serrano pepper, carrots and cauliflower then I added the liquids. Tasted fantastic.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Whole family enjoyed this soup!
Cauliflower Soup#2#0#This may be one of the best soups I've ever tasted. Easy to make, filling, , delicious and lots of veges 
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#I thought this was good. I added about a half of a vidallia onion finely chopped to the dutch oven with a couple of Tbls. of butter and let that cook for a few minutes before adding the rest of the veggies. I let the veggies cook for a few more minutes tossing them together and adding salt and pepper before adding chicken broth (21/2 cups instead of water and omitting the boullion). I then made the cheese sauce adding fresh nutmeg and then added the cheese sauce to the vegetables. I did not add the hot sauce .
Cauliflower Soup#1#4#I was disappointed. Easy to make but very bland even with hot sauce. I added bacon and still no flavor. .
Cauliflower Soup#3#0#This was such an easy recipe and simply delicious! I adjusted all measurements by half and it was just right for serving 2 of us. I also used vegetable broth instead of water. Will be using this recipe again and again!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Easy recipe made a great hearty flavorful soup! I will definitely make again!
Cauliflower Soup#2#1#added garlic, serrano pepper, broccoli and an extra cup of cheese. also find that cooking the veggies 12-15 makes them too mushy. cut the time in half. I have made this a dozen times at least and just keep tweaking to my tastes. of course everyone is different but it's a quick and inexpensive recipe so you can really just keep experimenting! thank you for the recipe!
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#I made this today - having my daughter & grands over for lunch. It's SO tasty! I did add sautéed onions & garlic & 1/2 of a hot pepper from the garden and then thinly sliced crimini mushrooms. I'll come back after lunch with a family update! OH, and this was my very first time making a rue and it was successful!! YAY! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Made it today room-mates raved - have to try it again w/onions. Love your recipes
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Made this tonight for the first time. My husband and I loved it, and my 7 and 4 year old too! I did add 1/4 cup diced onion as others suggested. I would imagine you could use this same base for broccoli or potato soup too.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This is the best soup! Took to work and everyone wanted the recipe!
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#I too added green onion and garlic. Turned out great! Kelly
Cauliflower Soup#0#1#Making this soup tomorrow. Just wanted to reply to ninny54, the cheese IS mentioned in the recipe toward the end. Maybe reread the recipe so you'll know when to add it. ??
Cauliflower Soup#2#0#I made this over the weekend because it was chilly out and really wanted a nice soup. Made as stated in the recipe but I think next time I will add some sautéed onions to it. I did use my potato masher to break up the cauliflower into smaller pieces. Will definitely make again.
Cauliflower Soup#0#1#Hubby pronounced this, Very Good even though he is not a soup lover. I did add a chopped onion and because the head of cauliflower was quite large, I added some extra celery and 1 extra carrot. I used skim milk and added Bergeron Cheese instead of cheddar. because that's what was in the'fridge. This one goes into my Good enough to serve to Company recipe file. 
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#Make this 4-5 times a year. I do add chopped onion. 1/4 cup of chopped celery? What do I do with the rest of the celery stalk. lol I think adding one celery stalk to the soup will be just fine, maybe even more.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Absolutely deeeelicious! And super easy!
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#I use broth instead of water and double recioe so I can freeze for later, so good!
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#This is so good! It is always requested in our house. The only changes-- I use broth instead of water, add 1/4 cup chopped onion to the carrot mixture, and cayenne instead of hot sauce. Yum!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#My husband, who doesn't like cauliflower, loved this recipe. It is delicious! 
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#It was very good only thing is it got real thick what did i do wrong
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#9/14/2020...I'm just reading the email for this recipe. Sounds great but can someone please tell about the cheese? Mentioned in the instructions but not ingredients. Thanks! 
Cauliflower Soup#2#0#Good recipe. You need to add onion to your ingredient list and sauté the vegetables in butter first and then follow the rest of your recipe as written. Also just a pinch of nutmeg will really enhance the flavour.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Made it and he lovedit.This is a very good soup.
Cauliflower Soup#2#0#This is a really good base recipe - good as is, but you can customize to come up with something that is perfect for your taste. I threw in a handful of smoked salmon just before serving and also ran half of it through the blender just to thicken a bit more - salmon really kicked it up a notch. I always follow a recipe the first time and go from there. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This soup is so good! I did use an emulsion blender to make chunks smaller. My husband loved it!
Cauliflower Soup#1#1#Such an easy recipe and very healthy. I added garlic and onions, used 2 1/2 C chicken broth instead of water, and excluded the chicken/vegetable bouillon.
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#You can use oat flour - I am allergic to wheat - and use oat flour - it works great!! Never miss the flour at all!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#They make the soup about once a month. It's my Favorite soup.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Good taste, nice and easy to follow instruction even for non chefs
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I LOVE this soup! The only things I add to it are: both green and red pepper (whole of each), an onion, a t. of garlic, and ? t Cayenne Pepper.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I love this recipe
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Great basic recipe. I added 2 teaspoons Tuscan seasoning, onion, more celery, more carrot, minced garlic, and more chopped celery. Yum!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This soup was delicious and so quick and easy to make!! I didn't have any soup stock on hand so I just used water and added a bunch of extra seasonings (poultry seasoning, garlic, cayenne, paprika, etc. right at the beginning) it worked out really well and my whole family was happy with it! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Great recipe quick to make and delicious
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This has been a family favourite for many years. So quick and easy to make!
Cauliflower Soup#0#1#Best cauliflower soup ever! I'm going to add shrimp the next time!
Cauliflower Soup#7#0#Really wish you'd people would rate the actual recipe rather than rate it with you tweaks and changes.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This turned out very good, I have made it twice. I did use broth instead of bullion. Very easy to make.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Our favorite soup!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This is now one of my favorite soups. I always add a small can of green chilies in place of the hot sauce.
Cauliflower Soup#2#1#I liked this recipe as is but I agree with a couple of the comments, especially the one about the soup being bland as written. So I made some slight modifications second time around which prospective cooks may want to consider. I added a lot more carrots and celery, around 1 cup of each plus two large finely diced garlic cloves. I found the carrots and cauliflower cooked much faster than the celery the first time I made it so next time I added the celery to the soup base 3 minutes before adding the carrots and cauliflower. I also added some cumin to the bechamel sauce. i do like some kick to my soups so I added hot pepper sauce as directed the first time. I used red pepper flakes second time as I thought the Tabasco Sauce turned the soup a bit too orange. I like the suggestion to add some chopped onions as well. I will try that next time just to keep tweaking the basic recipe,as apparently that is what I do!
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#I love this recipe! I just tweak it a little bit by adding some chopped onion and some fresh minced garlic!! Thanks Taste of Home!!
Cauliflower Soup#0#1#As I was making the soup, I was wondering why there was no garlic or onion? Looking at the spices, I only see salt and pepper. I just knew this soup was going to be bland, and I don't want to make something, and it not be great! I melted the butter and added garlic and onion. I also added crumbled bacon and cubed ham. I used red pepper flakes instead of the hot sauce. I also thicken the soup more, to get a more like a chowder consistensy. I chopped in some fresh parsley just before serving. After my changes, I loved it 
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#This is such a great recipe! 1. Because it's mostly ingredients I keep in-stock, 2. It's easy, 3. It's delicious! This one is worth saving and sharing. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#1#I love this soup but how are you getting 2 quarts out of 4 1/2 cups of liquid?
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#Mom and kid approved! Recipe was so easy and ingredients won't break the bank. The only tweeks I made were to omit the hot sauce and add 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes. At the end I used an immersion blender to make it more soup-y. Daughter told me I should make it every night! And at only 159 calories per serving, this recipe is a winner! 
Cauliflower Soup#1#1#Susan, Don't add the 3/4 tsp. of salt and use low-sodium chicken broth. If you are used to no salt, this shouldn't be a problem for you. Sometimes lemon or a splash of vinegar will help. Use sharp cheddar instead of mild cheese for a bit more tang. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#How could I make this less sodium content, seems quit high. I would use mrs dash and no salt bouillon any other suggestions, I still want to keep the flavour. I also wouldn't use hot sauce
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#I want this soup everyday!
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#We had a snowstorm in Michigan today. This comfort food really hit the spot and has great flavor. My husband and son didn't know they were eating cauliflower! I will definitely be making this again. Thank you. 
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#I made this and it's a hit. Add a loaf of semolina bread and it's an awesome meal!!
Cauliflower Soup#2#0#I make this all the time. It is delicious! You can substitute/add broccoli, Brussel sprouts, asparagus, cabbage. I always add a bit of finely minced red bell pepper with the veggies and I brown garlic and onions with the butter/oil. It takes it to another level. I also fry bacon or add chunks of ham to the soup. SO GOOD!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Wow, this soup was wonderful! So easy to put together and good flavour. The only things I did differently were to put a ¼ tsp of crushed red pepper flakes in, instead of the hot sauce and I chopped the vegetables fine with my hand blender after they were cooked and then added the milk mixture. This recipe went into my keep file!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Made it as stated, it was amazing ! My husband said please make that again!
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#Loved this soup! I roasted the cauliflower in olive oil with a shallot and a sweet green pepper for about 15 minute. Also used a very small amount of slab bacon sauteed with the cut up stems and leaves of the cauliflower. After roasting, I put the veggies in the pot with the broth
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Absolutely delicious and so easy to make. This is a home run!!!
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#The easy recipe combined satisfying vegetable flavors in a light cheesy base. I measured my ingredients using 5 3/4 cups cauliflower (including some sliced stem pieces), 3/4 cup carrot, 1/2 cup celery (1 stalk), and 2 chicken cubes. Watch the cooking time for veggies to avoid mushy texture. I cooked mine 10-minutes and thought cauliflower was a bit too soft. Have cheese sauce ingredients measured and ready once the pot of vegges are truned on, this goes together quickly. I l enjoyed this soup because the recipe only used one cup of cheese, the calories were lower, and it avoided a thick, glue-like soup. Serves 4 as a main dish; they will want more!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Great recipe - easy and quick and result is homely and delicious
Cauliflower Soup#0#2#Yummy and a success with the family... used 1% milk and added some lentils to thicken. Increased pepper as had no chilli oil . added crushed coriander seeds cos I like them. Left out flour and would leave out butter next time . Gave each bowl a tiny bit of vintage cheddar so reduced fat. Used vegetarian oxo. (used this recipe to use up left over cooked cauliflower from Sunday lunch) Really Lovely will make again x
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I made this exactly as written (except I subbed herb
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Very good soup. I added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg because that's what I do...to cauliflower soup. I also used store brand EXTRA sharp Cheddar Cheese. Told once to always use extra sharp Cheddar ...to get more taste for the buck! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Made this soup and ate almost all of it myself because it taste fantastic.
Cauliflower Soup#0#1#I followed directions. It tastes very bland. Very disappointed.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Loved this soup. Easy to make. Will keep as a favorite soup recipe
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Outstanding... a new family favorite. I did several things differently... by accident. I added 2 Tablespoons of chicken seasoning (Better than Bullion) instead of 2 teaspoons. Knowing that would be salty I didn't add any extra salt. I added 4 Tablespoons butter and flour... instead of 3. And still only used the 2 cups of mile. Added a bit extra cheese and cooked it for about 10 minutes. LOVED it. Not bland at all... 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Love this soup. I just added a bit of shredded onion and coarsely mashed the cauliflower. Thank you.
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#I added more celery and cheese. Also added onions. Coarsely mashed. Excellent.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#The recipe was blend so I ate dried herbs, more salt, onion and garlic powder. After doing that it was amazing
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#OMG! Just made this soup for the first time tonight and it is delicious!! Super easy and fast too and given low fat milk, a little butter and cheese, pretty healthy. This will be a new staple!!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I like this recipe. I followed the recipe as stated except I added 2 1/2 cups of vegetable broth instead of bouillon and 2 1/2 cups of water. The broth was pretty thin so I added 4 additional tablespoons of flower mixed it with the broth and added back into the soup. That thickened it up. The taste was a little bland but still good. Next time I may add green chillies! Will make again.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I love this recipe. However, to make it gluten free, I do not add the milk, butter or flour. Instead, I just leave a couple of large pieces of cauliflower, then when it is done, I remove the large pieces and put them in the blender then add it back to the soup. Voila, cream soup without the gluten. I do add some salt and garlic, as well. I think it is delicious.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This is delicious soup. My husband n I prefer cauliflower over broccoli. I tweeked the rue slightly based on other comments of the soup being watery, n it turned out perfect. Next time I make it my husband wants bacon added.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Relatively easy to make and very good. It's not a heavy, cream soup. Flavor gets better a day or two after it's made. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#So delicious on a winter day. I added broccoli and corn. Thank you, Debbie, for sharing this recipe.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I have made this recipe twice. My broth was not thin at all. I took a couple of couple of cups and pureed , then made sure the roux was thick when I added it to the broth. My soup is really, really creamy, and I followed the recipe exactly--the first time. The second batch I added a can of chopped green chilies, just because I like them. Oh, and I didn't add the carrots, because I don't like carrots. This recipe is one I will fix frequently. I even tricked my husband into thinking it was baked potato soup. He loved it! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Followed recipe to a tee. Broth was very very thin!!! I used the chicken broth to boil veggies!! ??? Might add some corn now..?? When I added broth
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#YumO! I added 1/3 cup frozen corn, 4.5 oz copped green chillies and 8oz chopped cherrywood ham. Very versatile recipe!
Cauliflower Soup#0#1#Made this last night. Very easy. Made it substituting 2 1/2 cups of low sodium chicken broth for the water and bouillon. And served it with hot pepper sauce on side. A great basic recipe, but definitely needed the hot pepper sauce as it was bland. Will make again but definitely with adjustments to up seasoning. Thanks Debbie
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Great soup. I did exactly as the recipe stated. It was delicious. The next time I make it i will add some chopped roasted green chilies in it. Ima green chilei nut
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#OMG made this yesterday and only different I did was add some leftover ham in the begining and it was the very best cauliflower soup I ever had. Soooooo easy to make, little time and the taste is unbelievable. Going to make it again next week!!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#So easy and good! I substituted broccoli for cauliflower and it was wonderful!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This soup was amazing!! I added a garlic clove and a potato also increased all ingredients to feed all. I think original amounts were not enough. I will definitely make this again!! Everyone loved it.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Yum! Made it (not changing anything)
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This soup was easy and delicious. Have to double or triple since my husband couldn't get enough! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I made a half recipe for taste testing and thought it was very good. I will make it again, but the half recipe only yielded 2 1/2 cups of soup. I did not see where anyone else questioned the quantity. I track all the nutritional data in recipes and this makes it difficult to accept the portions and calorie count shown for the recipe. I double-checked the amount of the ingredients and found I was accurate with that. Anyone else find it does not make the quantity stated?
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Omg... I made this, I did add mushrooms instead of carrots. And i did add smoked paprika but amazing. I'm a vegetarian so this was perfect. I used vegetable broth not water also. I am in love with this and will pass it along. Yummy! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#1#Very underwhelmed! With all the fabulous reviews I was hoping for so much more. Followed recipe exactly but didn't have hot sauce..might've helped a little but I doubt enough to make me want to make again.
Cauliflower Soup#1#0#Pretty good! I doubled it and added chopped onion, because a soup without onion seemed weird, and extra cheese. I also added some freshly grated parmesan and romano cheeses, Lawry's garlic salt and Tony Chachere's creole seasoning instead of the hot sauce. I omitted the salt and pepper from the roux and added to taste after I combined the cheese sauce to the vegetables. I would've gave it 2.5 to a 3 without my tweaks. I will use this recipe again for broccoli cheese soup. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#1#I found this soup so bland and runny. I even used Pepper Jack instead of cheddar. I don't understand what all the raves were about. Not yummy, just boring. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I make this often, I sometimes use broccoli, it's yummy too. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I made this with almond milk
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#senstrings: Read Test Kitchen Tips below directions. It gives you gluten free suggestions.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I am just questioning how this soup can be considered gluten free when it uses all-pupose flour (it comes up in the results when I search for GF) ?
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This soup is easy and delicious!!! 5 stars
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Great soup very easy made a couple changes for personal preference. Used coconut milk and skipped the cheese. Used half veggie broth plus the bullion. It was fabulous
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I stumbled upon this recipe and made it because I needed to cook a cauliflower. This soup is absolutely Delicious!!!!!! So easy to make and all of the ingredients are staples in my pantry. I will be making this again and again!!!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I made this and really enjoyed it. I had to sub out a few things though. If you are unlucky like me and did not have any type of broth on hand, you can use a couple cups of water with a couple tbsp of melted butter added to mimic the fats in broth. Then, i added a few seasonings to the mixture to taste : cardamom, turmeric, nutmeg, white pepper and a dash of salt. I also begun with some chopped onion and 2 cloves of garlic (just preference) . I also did not have carrots, but used frozen butternut squash in its place. Next time if i have more time, I will roast my vegetables.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I was a bit disappointed because of the outstanding reviews. The ingredients weren't anything special and that is what I got. My changes were that I precooked the cauliflower by roasting it before adding it to the broth after the other vegetables were cooked. I also used the Smokey hot sauce for more flavor. I will be doctoring the leftovers as I serve it.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Very quick and simple to make. Delicious!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I made this soup the other night for supper & it was a big hit! Quick & easy to make & full of flavor! Will make it very often. Didn't change a thing. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Easy and super delicious, even without a carrot;)Saving it!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Absolutely delicious and very simple to make. I used almond milk and chickpea flour. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Couldn't wait to try this recipe just by seeing the picture.I made it and it was a home run !And I fell in love !Have made this soup half a dozen times since, and plan on making it tonight for family visiting from Colorado !Thanks for sharing it with us 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#A friend of mine made this for new years it was excellent. Kept thinking about it so today's the day I'm making it! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I loved this soup and so easy to make, will be making this again SOON!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Easy, tasty and low calorie. I tried it with almond milk instead of milk and there wasn't much difference in taste. IT was still very good. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Best. Soup. I. Have ever made!!!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I wouldn't bother with this recipe again. Very little flavor except cauliflower, instructions are iffy at best ( 2-1/2 cups of water to cover the veggies, really?) My boyfriend & I ate it, but I threw the rest of it out as well as the recipe itself. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I love cauliflower soup as the weather gets cooler. It's so comforting and filling :-) I adjusted this recipe to make it a lot lighter in calories and fat, and it tastes incredible. Before boiling the vegetables in stock to make the soup, I roasted the cauliflower, onions and garlic first. It adds a lovely depth of flavor.

Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Very good. It's a traditional cauliflower soup. I did use the hot sauce and I think without it, it would be bland. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Great soup recipe.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Delicious Soup! I made it just as the recipe instructs. I had no hot sauce, I did have some Pepper jack cheese , so I added two slices of it. I like the fact that this soup is good for me, tasty and not high in calories.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Fabulous Soup, so easy to make, I substituted the chicken bouillon cube for a 32 oz carton of Vegetable Broth. Perfect choice. I also cut up more carrots and celery as we love veggies. This is the third time making this soup and it is a keeper. Very tasty.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Great soup made this as a low carb soup .. used unsweetened almond milk ,,, took out a cup of veggies and creamed the rest then added the cup of veggies back in. very good got 10 serving with only 5 carbs per serving
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This cauliflower soup is easy to make. It is delicious, light, filling, and for this family, a keeper recipe. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Everyone loved this soup!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#My family loves cauliflower and this soup is a real treat on cold winter days. They can't seem to get enough of it. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I love cauliflower soup and this will definitely be in my rotation. The second time I made it the only cheese I had on hand was a decent pepper jack so that's what I used, and it was even better! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Subbed chicken broth for bullion because that's all I had on hand. Soup was delicious - even my very picky 5 year old ate it! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Very good soup. Takes longer than 30 minutes - unless you already have the vegetables prepared. I used one 14 oz. can of reduced-sodium chicken broth vs. bouillon and ended up including 1 3/4 cups water with the broth (with only the broth plus 3/4 cup water, there wasn't enough liquid for the vegetables to cook in). I added 1 tsp. dried parsley, 1/4 tsp. onion powder and 1/8 tsp. garlic powder, but did not include the hot sauce. The head of cauliflower was about 1 1/2 lb. and about 6 cups of florets. The finished soup was just a little over 8 cups. Served with corn muffins, yummy! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I'm giving this 5-stars for taste! In my own recipe book, it's a 4-star recipe because I reserve 5 stars for recipes that I would serve to company and it's not quite fancy enough for that. But when it's a cold and rainy night, and you're home alone with your husband staying in, and you have a loaf of french bread that needs to be eaten, this is the perfect meal. I just used a spicy salt and pepper blend instead of hot sauce. We loved it. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#So easy to make and everyone loved it!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Excellent and easy to make.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This was wonderful and easy to make. I added an onion and used sharp cheddar. Will make a little thicker next time as well.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I changed it up a little. Added a jalapeno, substituted a half teaspoon xanthium gum for the flour and unflavored almond milk for the milk. Sooo good.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Very easy to make and filling! Used sharp cheese and turned out delicious!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Amazing soup! All 4 kids loved it also. Followed recipe exact. Used sharp cheese and thickened it a little at the end! Will make again!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Loved this soup. I am not a soup lover, but on a hunch tried this recipe and discovered a new fav. Simple to make and very tasty and filling. Simply delicious.
Cauliflower Soup#0#1#LOVED IT! I don't normally like cheese in my soup, but the cheese compliments this soup perfectly, and I loved the addition of the celery. I added two small onions. Next time I will saute the vegetables in the butter first, then make the roux. I used 4 T butter and flour and only 2 cups bouillon (low-sodium). 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Made this soup and it is delicious.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I made this and it is delicious. I didn't have cheddar but I had marble which is close enough. I also added onion to celery and carrots while cooking. Will make this recipe again. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I made this soup and thought it was delicious! Added broccoli for a bit more color. Will save this recipe to enjoy again!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Just made this with pepper jack cheese and it was awesome. Will be making this again.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Just made this soup for dinner & absolutely loved it. Forgot to pick up some shredded cheddar cheese, so used velveeta & it was delicious. Will be making it again...soon!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This was excellent I used broccoli instead of cauliflower and used evaporated milk added onion, parsley and basil, I did mash the broccoli so it wasn't big chunks, not mashing it to bits but just to break up some. Will be making this again wonderful. For those that said it was too thin I didn't think so at all 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I did think the soup was a little on the bland side, so I added some onion powder that that seemed to help. I also added a bit more flour because I like a thicker soup and I thought this was on the thin side. I do have to say, it was very easy to make.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#My Favorite soup. I exchange chicken broth for water, add an onion and an extra cup of cheese to give a little more pizazz that my family loves.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Without a doubt one of the best soups I've made! I followed the directions and added a little extra cheese. Came out very good and didn't last long either! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I first made this a week ago without bouillon, which I didn't have. I chose this recipe after reading several others because of the nutritional values. Then I read a review about substituting chicken broth for the bouillon and water. I have type 2 diabetes sooo...low sodium chicken broth, low fat cheddar and milk, and it's a solid 5 star from ingredients that are usually in my kitchen. Thanks for posting, Debbie!Added after trying this a few times: Great base with almost endless possibilities! I've also done this as potato soup and chicken soup and still experimenting. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Really tasty! Used celery salt instead of fresh celery (reduced reg salt some to accommodate). Added some onion powder, garlic powder, and 4 oz Velveeta.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I made this soup per the recipe and did add some minced garlic and half an onion, next time I would add two more carrots. The soup is great it is a keeper.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Very easy recipe and quite delicious! I did dice 1/2 of a small onion and omitted the cheese and the soup was still delicious. Thank you.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Really good
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Very skeptical of veggie soups but WOW! Very delicious and full of flavor. I just diced the carrots and added a 1/4 cup diced onions too. Will be making again!!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Excellent soup, I highly recommend trying it.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Easy recipe, with most ingredients already in the kitchen. Very good. Kids loved it, my toddler included! Suggest pairing it with salad and home made bread sticks for a meal OR a sandwich! Yum! Also, one more suggestion.... the recipe says to put it in a bowl, but I'd put it in a pan and bring it to a boil ;) 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I used ham pieces in broth that I simmered from leftover baked ham bone, instead of a chicken base because I had it on hand. We like cauliflower and ham so I thought it would be good. It was.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Since there are only 2 of us, I made a 1/2 batch - using about 3.5 cups of cauliflower. It made about 3 large dinner size bowls of soup. Excellent! My husband really liked it. Instead of hot sauce, I sprinkled on a Turmeric spice mixture. Yum, just the right amount of spice!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#this soup is excellent! I did however , use no-sodium chicken bouillon , since we are watching sodium intake. It was great! Next time, I may use broccoli .
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Very good basic recipe! I added some broccoli and a handful of green peas for color. Add or subtract - it's all good. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Does anyone proofread these recipes? Direction 1 says to put ing. in a bowl then bring to a boil...
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Good stuff, even people who are afraid to eat cauliflower will like this, if they have guts.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Quick easy and good
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Easy and yummy. My son and I really liked it, but it didn't win over my husband who doesn't care for cauliflower most of the time. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Quick an easy. Omitted chile peppers(dont like the hot/heat it would bring) ,left out the celery. Used half an half mixed w/half cup water instead of whole milk. Used Monterey cheese instead of cheddar. Creamy an yummy! ! Not a drop left after serving!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Outstanding!!! Look no further... this is the only cauliflower soup recipe you will ever need.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#OMGosh!!! Just made this recipe for the first time and it is to die for! I did as some other reviewers stated by adding in some onion, garlic, and red pepper. I didn't have any celery, so instead, used some dry celery flakes. I subbed 2 cups of Almond milk for the 2% (for those of us who are lactose intolerant) and added in some hot pepper flakes. This is a keeper for sure and will be trying it with broccoli next time. I think some bacon bits would be good in it as well. Thanks for a WONDERFUL recipe!!! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Not a fan. Too salty and the gravy overpowered the taste of the veggies. I wish I had found another cauliflower recipe. :(
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This will be my staple. Absolutely delicious. I live cauliflower soup. This is my favorite.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Loved this so did my family. I didn't have any carrots so I grated parsnips. Also I added fresh grated and chopped ginger. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I don't have vegetable bullion. How much vegetable broth should I use? 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#this is likely one of the easiest, tastiest soup...definitely on my to make list again. I was surprised that it tasted as good as it did at first taste and didn't need to sit to gel the flavours. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This was probably the best soup that I've ever made. I followed the recipe and added the hot sauce. I used an emulsion blender on the cooked vegetables before adding the cheese sauce. I also added a few croutons and fresh cracked pepper to each bowl......absolutely delicious. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I have made this soup twice now. Love the flavours! I do find that it is a bit thin for a creamy soup. I tried pureeing some of the cauliflower and adding it back in, but I think next time I make it I will try reducing the amount of water used to cook the vegetables. Overall a yummy soup recipe!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I made this soup last week for the first time because I had leftover cauliflower that I needed to use up. It was so quick & easy to make so I wasn't expecting the taste to be so great. It was really good though. This will now be my go-to Cauliflower Soup. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Delicious soup! I added 1 medium onion diced. I also saut?ed the onion, celery, carrots and cauliflower in 1 Tbsp butter for a few minutes before adding water and bouillon.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Fantastic soup - didn't use hot pepper but did add minced garlic and onion. Instead of bouillon cube just added chicken broth. Will definitely make again and again. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I am a huge soup lover and this was really tasty!! I didn't use celery or hot pepper sauce but I added in garlic powder and chopped onions. Definitely will be making this again! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This is a great soup. A family favorite
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I tried this recipe tonight and it is delicious! I didn't have celery, didn't use the hot pepper sauce, but added some cayenne pepper because I like that better, and used 4 cheese Mexican style cheese because that's what I had on hand. I used canned carrots (collective gasp)This will definitely be making repeat appearances in my house. My nephew even commented on how good it was. Thanks for sharing this one. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I tried this recipe for the first time today. Have to say that there seemed to be toolittle seasoning involved so I used my go to combo of onion powder, white pepper and sea salt. I literally use these seasonings in every savory dish. Also added parsley and basil flakes. I didn't have shredded cheddar so I used six cheese Italian shredded cheese that I did have. This soup will move into my personal line up. The hubby is the soup king here but this one is mine. We both loved it. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This soup was awesome!!! I left out the celery (had none in the house) and added chicken to get more protein. Very easy and quick for lunch also. This will be made again. :)
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#My Nephew thought he did not like Cauliflower....And then he had this soup. Its a winner in his book.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This soup was amazing! I did use low sodium chicken broth in place of the water and bullion. This was so good served w/ some great sea salt and garlic pita crackers!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Loved it - quick, easy to make on a hectic holiday night! My husband, who is not a fan of cauliflower, even had seconds! Made it per recipe - no substitutions. Did not have hot sauce on hand, but will try splash in it next time! May try it with some smoked sausage next time, too, for a heartier meal.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Very hearty, chunky soup. I made it as stated but used a cup of veggie stock and added a half onion. It came out very thick, had to add a little extra milk. It's a great and easy recipe but as others have said, bland. I added extra salt but still kind of lacked something and I didn't want to be pouring the salt in. Still great and I can't wait to make again with some herbs and with broccoli too. Thanks. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Delicious, easy, and very filling!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Loved the taste. Leftovers went into freezer. I'm anxious to thaw and try again. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Excellent soup My family loves it also......my sister tried it and also loves it and now makes it for her family too.Thanks Taste Of Home
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Delicious! Added some onion and garlic powder (because I really like onion and garlic). Would have been great without.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I made this and it was amazing I added alittle left over chicken I did double batch glad I did. YUM!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I made a half batch of this last night and it was great! I love a quick recipe that is still from-scratch!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I made this soup yesterday and it is wonderful. I had my daughter and her family try it as well. Everyone loved it. I didn't have any bouillon cubes so I used equal amount of vegetable broth and no water. I also took someone's advice and pureed just a little of the cauliflower mixture to thicken the soup. This is a well-balanced, tasty soup. Thanks for the great recipe. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I'm not sure how thick the soup is supposed to be, but it does seem to be thin. I added red onion, kale and a pinch of cayenne pepper.I'm taking it to work for a lunch. Hope everyone that tries it, likes it. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Good but a little bland, as is. I added sauteed onions and garlic, with a splash of Sherry and a pinch of nutmeg. Now excellent.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I thought the flavor of this soup was very good. I will make again but next time I will cut the water by 1/2 cup, I thought soup was too thin.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I had a nice sized cauli which I prepared, some skim milk, some heavy cream, but no other veggies, so instead of celery and carrots I added a can of mixed veggies, used 1 cup milk, and one of cream, plus 3/4 cup Kraft shredded Pepper Jack. It was a most delish soup and I will enjoy it often this winter! The pepper jack was a real winner.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Love the texture of this soup. Its rich, thick and chunky . Most comforting. I did make a few changes and exchanges. I added garlic and onions. I also replaced some of the water for white wine and right before serving added a pinch of Nutmeg *JanieTaste of Home Volunteer FE
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Tasty, but a bit bland. I think that I would add some onion to this recipe.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#EX!!!!!..U can also add Broccoli part way thru cooking...
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I love it ,will try it again thanks for the awesome recipy
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I made this for a Christmas Eve family dinner. It was a huge hit.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This is wonderful!!! I did think it needed a little more flavor (I didn't add the pepper sauce), so I used 4 chicken bouillon cubes in the water. Perfect!!! I have made this twice, once with cauliflower and once with broccoli, and will make it again and again!!! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Fantastic. I didn't shred my carrots and I added a few extra. I got rave reviews at home. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This was very good and very easy. I added frozen pea's I had on hand after tasting it and that made it even better. I also thought it needed more salt and would like to try it with garlic like others have said next time I make it. But over all very good my husband even liked it but he said could we add some bacon he's a meat person. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Love it so rich and tasty and only 159 calories for 1 cup serving
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Very good. I would like it a little thicker so I may mash the cauliflower some next time.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Good!!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#So simple and soooo good!!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Delicious and so easy to make!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Working man husband is diabetic-- hard to fill up on a low carb diet- -but add in 1 or 2 lbs of browned pork sausage to this marvelous soup recipe and he's in heaven! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Fantastic Soup! I left my cauliflower in big chunks when it was simmering. Then once it was soft, before I added the b?chamel sauce, I gently used a potato masher. This ensured all the cauliflower chunks were in bite size pieces.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#It was very easy to make and tasted great. I will make it again, soon. I also made it substituting broccoli.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Awesome soup...I added about half a bag of baby carrots, a jalapeno pepper, one sweet bell pepper, one onion, 3 stalks of celery, one carton of turkey broth, 5 cups of water, garlic clove, salt & pepper. Cooked until tender, ran veggies thru Vitamix and with the broth mixture I added 3T. of flour and 2cups milk to make my rue. Added the 1 cup of cheddar cheese, stirred and added my pureed veggies. WOW Oh WOW...this soup rocks. Very filling and healthy. According to my calorie count, each cup is about 55 calories...Eat More Soup.... :-)
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Hubby and I love this soup. Next time we will add cooked bacon to it to give it also a meaty flavor. And my hubby generally does not like soup!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I highly recommend making this soup. I added minced garlic to it.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Made the original recipe except swapped 1/8 tsp hot pepper flakes for sauce. Not sure how the soup got rated at 8 - 1 cup servings when there's only 4 1/2 cups liquid in the recipe ... Irregardless, the soup was delicious and it's on my keeper list. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This was excellent. I thought it would be bland but it was full of flavor and my guest raved about it. I used frozen cauliflower, almond oil and basil olive oil because that is all I had on hand. I pureed the vegetables and served it as an entree. There was enough for four people, not eight but we were all satisfied. Everyone asked for the recipe.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This is very simple and tasty. You wouldn't know it's a healthy soup by the indulgent taste. I made it with milk and it's still delicious. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#So good. Rich and flavorful. Easy to make.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Fabulous recipe! Great use of cauliflower, tasty and hearty soup. I used a little less butter, more cauliflower and carrots than called for. I also used a can of condensed milk instead of fresh and hit it with the immersion blender. I will definitely make again!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Very flavorful. I doubled the celery, used low sodium chicken base, added extra 1/2 cup water and omitted salt. I've never had cauliflower soup, but this will go in my collection of soup favorites. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I just made this soup and just like Moxier I tripled the celery and carrots and added 1/2 onion and some button mushrooms... it turned out awesome...its a great rue and soup starter for all cheesy milky soups... good recipe!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#During yesterday's snowstorm I made this rich and creamy soup. I use milk and had to use a little extra as the soup was too thick. I also pureed the vegetables before adding the milk and cheese mixture. Serve with salad and fresh bread. My husband lived it. Good thing I doubled the recipe! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Absolutely wonderful and healthy. I used my basket from Co-op we picked up yesterday. I changed by using 3 X more celery and carrots, and half low salt chicken stock I had on hand. To thicken, I used King Arthur Instant Clear Jel rather than flour and dropped the butter in pot. The pepper flakes enhanced the flavors.Thank you Debbie 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I don't normally post reviews, but WOW! I did take what I thought was the best advice from the other reviewers, but must give 5 stars for the original recipe for getting me started. I doubled the carrots and celery, and used 3 cups of low sodium chicken broth. I also gave the cauliflower mixture a few shots with the immersion blender. After doing so, I added about 8 oz. of chopped cooked ham. I used red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce. I also cut down on the salt -- probably a bit less than 1/2 tsp. The final result was incredible. Kudos to the OP! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Amazing! Perfect comfort food and finally a soup without onion and garlic! (I am currently 6 months pregnant and have had an aversion to onions and garlic my entire pregnancy-trying to find canned soup or a homemade soup recipe without these ingredients is like searching for the Holy Grail.) I made a couple of modifications-I used my immersion blender to puree some of the soup to make it thicker and add a silkier texture. I also used crushed red pepper flakes to add some spice because franks hot sauce contains garlic powder. :)
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Fantastic recipe! My family loved it.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This soup is excellent! Everyone loved it, I also added some chopped onion because I had some handy from making another soup
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Very, very good! I added chopped onions. Next time I will make a little thicker, will add more flour. Flavor is awesome!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This was absolutely delicious. The only changes I made were to use 1% milk because that's all I had in the house, and to add a little chopped ham we had leftover from Christmas. Thick, creamy and SO quick, the whole thing took 30 minutes from prep to bowl. This is a keeper. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Making this again, tonight. I have a head of fresh cauliflower ready and waiting, and a few carrots. I swap the celery for a white onion, add a bit of cream to the milk, and hit it with the immersion blender a few times to make it almost-smooth... Add a grilled cheese sandwich and a little salad and I am one happy, happy girl.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#We loved this soup...served it to a friend and he thought it was excellent. Turned out he hated cauliflower and hadn't eaten any since he was a kid. This soup changed his mind! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This is sooo good And it's wonderful for the cold nights when you are tired and you are also vegetarian. I add a corn muffin and voila! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This was really good! I added ground sausage and some onion. Will definitely be making again.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#It tastes really good. You must like the combinations.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Diced a small onion and sweated it along with carrots (diced) and celery in 1 tbsp margerine for about 5 minutes.Followed remainder of recipe and turned out absolutely delicious.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#What happened to the BACON???? LOL!!!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I have made this at least once a week for the last month. I will tell you how I changed it just a bit and it is AMAZING!!!! I always use low sodium chicken broth. I add some broccoli and zucchini. And At the end, I always pur?e at least 2 to 3 cups and it is simply the best soup. I also double the recipe because in my household it disappears quickly!!!!! Oh and I always use reduced fat Mexican mixed cheese, like Sargento. Bon Appetite!!!!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Awesome! I used Velveeta cheese cause that's what I had. Hubby advised Make it again. Enough for 2 & enough left to reheat again. Can increase carrot or celery but use extra bouillon & water if you do. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Excellent! I knew with so many good reviews it had to be good & wow! Made as written without ingredient changes, but pur?ed about 1-1/2 cups mixture & mixed back in to add texture as another reviewer noted. Will definitely make again! Easy & wonderful!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Wonderful recipe. I like a chunkier soup so I doubled the veggies and steamed instead of boiled them and then added them when I combined the cheese sauce to the water. I also blended about 1/2 a head of cauliflower to make a creamier base. Had it with a side of soft boiled eggs for some protein and it was a wonderful dinner.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Wonderful recipe. So delicious. I added garlic, onion and brussel sprouts to add some green to the soup. Next time I will also add chicken. This was an easy recipe and perfect for Fal season.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#THANK YOU I am a newly diagnosed diabetic Finally I found something I like with low carbs. I made it with almond milk b/c my doctor wants me to switch from real milk to this stuff and it was still really good. I am actually eating it right now for breakfast! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#OMG!! What a delicious soup! Only made 2 adjustments. Used sodium-free chicken stock instead of water and bouillon. Also used a combo of american & asiago cheese a little more than a cup. Next time gonna use broccoli.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This was a really good soup. Its hard not to double the recipe. I omitted the red pepper sauce.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#The BEST soup I've ever made! It thicken up after it set awhile, so next time I'll add more milk or water. I added 2 cloves of garlic, chopped, and 1/2 tsp Tumeric (which I put in everything since it's so good for you) and chopped up 1/2 Red Pepper to add a little color. I LOVE THIS SOUP! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Delicious! I prefer to use 2C chicken stock with half a cup of water to eliminate the MSG from the bouillon.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I made this on a Sunday morning for lunch later on. It smelled so good my 12 yr old son had some for breakfast!!!! Its a huge hit and I love how he is getting several servings of vegies and calcium. The only thing I changed was I pureed about a cup of the cauliflower mixture before I added the milk cheese mixture. It was awesome!!!! Plus I love the fact that the recipe came from Chilliwack. My relatives all come from BC and I have spent many beautiful cool fall nights at Cultus Lake. This soup is perfect for fall. Thanks Debbie!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Great soup! It was very thick, and although I didn't mind it, others commented so I added some more milk to thin it out. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#EXCELLENT soup! Everyone in the family loved the soup - even my 3 year old who hates eating her vegetables. I added quite a bit more of each of the vegetables and doubled the rest of the recipe. Definitely worth a try.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Great! Super easy and quick. I added additional chopped celery and carrots. Along with the chicken bouillon, I used some boxed chicken broth in place of some of the water. In equal amounts, I increased all the ingredients to compensate for the added vegetables. YUM!!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Easy & delicious. I've made it with cauliflower as the main ingredient, and also combined cauliflower with broccoli. Very good each time. Goes great with any sort of sandwich. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This was very good soup. I used all boxed chicken broth in place of the water & no chicken bouillon cube. I added 1/2 diced onion, broccoli chopped pieces, 2 diced Yukon gold potatoes, & 2 garlic cloves. I also used half & half in place of the milk. I was trying to copy a restaurant's recipe. This was very close & the soup went quickly. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Very simple and quick to make! I omit the salt, and use 1/2 mild cheddar and 1/2 sharp cheddar cheese. So tasty!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I have made this soup several times. We love it! I have also substituted broccoli for the cauliflower. We belong to a co-op and sometimes we get cauliflower,sometimes broccoli. Both are yummy in this soup.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I love this soup. It is so quick and easy and is always a hit. I serve it whenever I have to whip up something healthy in a hurry. Have added corn on occasion as well. Yum. I usually do biscuits or scones to go with this soup and rarely is there leftovers. I've added this recipe to my huge list of favourite soups. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#loved this!! Easy to make, I left out the hot sauce, maybe next time i will try it with it but i really liked it with out so not sure
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#My goal this winter is to try one new soup recipe each week. This one was very easy, tasty, and healthy. This soup is low enough in carbs to be very good for anyone who is diabetic or counting carbs. This is a quick meal; while the vegetables are cooking I made the white sauce. I used a vegetable base rather than bouillon to cut out the MSG found in most bouillons. I used 1/2 tsp. of hot sauce; if you like a little spicier taste, add the entire teaspoon. Definitely a keeper of a recipe!!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Easy to make, creamy & oh so good!!! The only thing I added was a bit of onion. Great on a cold winter day!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Made this for dinner tonight. It was awesome. I added the hot sauce while cooking and a couple of dashes to my bowl. The recipe worked perfectly, is was quick and easy. This is a keeper.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#So it I decide to use chicken broth instead I don't use any water right? 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Made this tonight and it was a BIG hit the whole family gave it 5 stars! My daughter said this recipe is a keeper!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This soup is really good! Had to thicken it just a bit but it may have been that I added too much water. I chose not to use the hot sauce and it was great on this very cold night. This is a keeper!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#great soup used chicken stock and some vegetable stock instead of water. also used half and half for the milk with flour makes thicker. thanks for recipe
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#What can you substitute for the bouillon cubes? Too much sodium for me. Could I use chicken or vegetable broth? this sounds so good.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This is really good. I usually make a potato soup similar, but my husband has type 2 diabetes, this is a great alternative! Actually I think we like it better. I wouldn't change a thing. I serve it with crispy bacon and cheese on top. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Comfort food without guilt! I made one substitution: no cheddar cheese in the fridge, so I used asiago cheese. Wow! A little more upscale taste nuance, probably a better cheese to use when serving this soup to adult guests than for the children maybe. I can image adding maybe a dash of nutmeg to this recipe....
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Very pleased with this soup. I did doctor it up a bit. Added more cheese, dried onion, and some poultry seasoning. Will be making this again. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#My son's favorite soup. Try with an orange cauliflower from farmers market, it's outstanding. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This was awesome!!! Followed recipe to almost exactly, except added more flour at the end mixed with 1/2 cup milk to thicken a bit more. My husband who has never eaten cauliflower thought it was great as well. Thanks for a great fast recipe.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I was really impressed with this recipe. It is very flavorful. I followed the recipe exactly except used sriracha sauce because I did not have other hot sauce and I used 1% milk instead of 2%. Pleased with how it turned out and would make it again.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#The girls all asked for seconds. Great way to get the veges in. The base of the soup was great. We sauted all the vegetables and added onion, a yellow pepper, doubled the celery, parsley, seasoning salt. The girls recommended blending half and leaving half chucky. Would definetly make again.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This is a favorite of ours. I do add a chopped onion, just because we like it, and if I'm in a rush, I just chop the carrot. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Easy to make, very filling and VERY good.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I used fat free chicken broth, fat free cheddar cheese and fat free milk, it was still fantastic!!!!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This is literally the best soup recipe I've ever made. I keep making it, freezing it, remaking it... I'm a big fan of onions so I choose to caramelize some onions in the main pan to add a little more of a flavor layer, but it's great with or without it. MAKE THIS SOUP! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I've just recently begun to cook, and even the simplest things seem overwhelming for me. This soup, however, was as simple as can be, and turned out to be delicious! I made it for my family, and got some compliments (even the four-year-old ate it)! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#It was wonderful.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#My husband is not a fan of cauliflower but this recipe got a thumbs up from him. For a little added protein, I am going to add chicken. He wants a touch of cayenne. I plan to do both. Loved this soup!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Both my husband and I loved this recipe. I did add Smoked Paprika and a little more chicken broth. Also, I used goats milk and part skim part skim Mozzarella cheese as thats what I had on hand.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Made this recipe for the first time tonight, turned out great, I did use chicken broth instead of bullion and water and blended the veggies up before adding the cheese sauce. My picky 1 and 3 year olds devoured it, will be making it again.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#excellent!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#My husband and I really liked this soup. I added onion and I also thickened it with extra flour/water mixture at the end of cooking. I didn't measure my cheese but I'm sure I went a little heavy on that too. We added the hot sauce to our bowls and we liked it very much. This recipe is a keeper! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#One of the best soups I've ever made! I added some fresh dill..delicious! Even my son (who is not a soup lover) loved this soup!!!!! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I've probably made this recipe a dozen times since I first found it. It gets raves from everyone I've served it to, and I find it velvety and absolutely wonderful. Thanks for posting, Debbie! 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I had a head of cauliflower in my frig that I needed to use up so I decided to look online to see if I could find a good recipe. So glad I did. Actually had all of the ingredients for this soup and it is delicious! The only complaint I had was it could have been a little thicker but that can be easily solved. Loved the flavor so that's the most important thing. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This soup is delicious!! I keep cracked black pepper on the table with this recipe.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Delicious, quick and easy. I would definitely make again.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I sauteed a little bit of onions in the butter and used light cheese and skim milk, omitted the salt and thought it was still great!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I wanted very much to like this soup, but it is just too bland for my taste. Even with adding more cheese and hot sauce, it is bland. I think it definitely needs onion along with the carrots and celery.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I live where you can buy cauliflower from the farmer, huge head for $2. Enough for batch and a half. So this is so inexpensive to make and SO delicious. I didn't have any celery so I chopped up a few cabbage leaves. Will definately make it again. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This was superb. I did saute all the ingredients (plus a clove of garlic) first in a little olive oil before adding the broth/water. Made it even more flavorful....
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This recipe is really yummy. I substituted water chestnuts for the celery and it adds a nice crunch to the soup. I definitely added the hot sauce and I thought it would have tasted bland without it. Also, nice to have a cream soup without cream! Rather healthy.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This soup is so good! It's really quick and easy to make...great for a busy mom. I added closer to a cup and a half of cheese, just to finish out the bag (plus I love cheese) and the flavor was really nice. Great soup to beat the winter blues :) 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#So good....my family really enjoyed it. Served it with bread. Didn't change anything from the original recipe and omitted the hot sauce. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This soup is a winner ..wonderful and filling soup on a cold day;... replaced the water with Swanson's chicken broth and used half n half... really satisfying..this is a quick and delicious soup. 
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This was delicious! I made it just as the recipe said and I did put in a tiny amount of hot pepper sauce. We loved it
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Very good comfort food.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#There were no leftovers. Everyone had seconds, and it was delicious.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This was wonderful. I used fat free milk and fat free cheese for a healthy version and it was great. The taste was great.
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#This has become my absolute favorite soup!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#Delish!
Cauliflower Soup#0#0#I have made this a number of times and love it. Because I have only myself to feed, I cook the vegetables as shown but put half of it in the freezer for another day. I make half of the milk, etc. mixture each batch. Simple and satisfying.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is not a review per se, but a question to those bakers that have made this bread, when I eat it the first day it is made, its very good, however, it gets terribly dry after the first cuts and then it just does not taste as flavorful as that first slice. Within a day or so after being made it is dry and very sad tasting. Does anyone else have this same thing happen? I love the the easiness of this recipe and hope there are some suggestions on how I might get the moist taste you get from some of the store bought white breads.
Basic Homemade Bread#4#3#Me market doesn't have what you call bread flower. What needs to be added to flour to make it bread flower? I want to try this recipe because bread is the tata of the sandwich and I love a good sandwich. 
Basic Homemade Bread#3#2#This is a great recipe! My boyfriend loves home made bread, so I thought I'd try this one, and it turned out great! I'm very happy with the end results! 
Basic Homemade Bread#8#7#Has anyone tried letting it finish the final rise overnight in the fridge before baking in the morning?
Basic Homemade Bread#2#2#Perfect recipe for making Newfoundland Toutons.
Basic Homemade Bread#15#31#I waited three hours and the yeast never did bubble . Finally my wife came home and I was going to surprise her but I wanted to ask her from her experience why the yeast was not bubbling . SHe said of course she never heard of that and she went ahead and took over. Thanks a lot. Yeast bubbling? 
Basic Homemade Bread#2#3#I usually use my bread maker, but this recipe was easy and fun and the end results were fantastic. I will make this again!
Basic Homemade Bread#13#4#I just made these it's an easy recipe and they taste awesome han the house smells amazing 
Basic Homemade Bread#27#4#I've made bread before so nothing was new. But it was fun to have hot bread as part of our meal. The family loved it and it made me realize how really easy it is. Just THINK AND PLAN AHEAD and you can give real treat to the ones you love!!
Basic Homemade Bread#18#4#I made this, delicious but gets dry pretty fast and crumbles. I will try adding an extra Tbls of oil 
Basic Homemade Bread#18#8#Despite my relative novice level this turned out good! What made me select this recipe is the homemade bread tips that Taste of Home provided. I enjoyed the simplicity, which made the recipe more approachable. My first attempt was a fail and was completely my fault because I didn't check the expiration date on my yeast (which I knew after reading the Tips). The second attempt was so much better and gives me hope that I can get even better results. I didn't have bread flour so I just used regular all-purpose flour. My family enjoyed the bread as well! 
Basic Homemade Bread#21#4#It came out much better than I thought. It was a little to wet at first so I added more flour when kneading. It was delicious. I am no baker but this recipe gave me hope
Basic Homemade Bread#9#3#Is there anything better than homemade fresh warm bread smothered with butter? Definitely not. This bread is so delicious and so easy! Sure to impress any guests and yourself!
Basic Homemade Bread#15#1#This is a great recipe. I use high end garlic flavored EVOO instead of Canola oil to give it a garlic flavor and I use Caputo Italian Chef's Flour 00 and the bread is super light and fluffy. 
Basic Homemade Bread#4#1#I have been making the basic homemade bread and enjoying the 2 loaves. If I half the recipe to make one loaf, do I half all ingredients?? Even the yeast?? ... which means I only use 1-1/8 teaspoon?? Please advice. Thanks for all recipes!!
Basic Homemade Bread#12#6#I just started making real bread; parked the ol bread maker. Wanted the Grandmother taste. lol. I made this recipe and it was great. Saw another recipe that sounded glorious , adding honey etc. It was BORING, to say the yeast. Came back to this original bread recipe and will be making this one from now on. Like artisan bread of which I make a lot of , my question is this. I love a thick hard crust, Sooooo if I were to open the oven; say at the 3/4 cook time and spray cool water on the loaves.....would that thicken the crust? Thanks for the great basic delicious bread recipe....regards....Dave 
Basic Homemade Bread#3#32#Too bad and too sweet
Basic Homemade Bread#19#3#This bread is great. I haven't made anything yeasty in a very long time..... Easy and TASTY. Several reviews stated it was salty so I decreased the salt, MISTAKE, use 1 T as the recipe states and I used a lot less flour also. I live in assisted living and the residents liked the bread! Slathered pieces in real butter.....YUM! Make this bread! 
Basic Homemade Bread#31#21#These instructions are not clear for a first time baker.?????????
Basic Homemade Bread#15#0#I use this recipe for my jalepeno cheese bread also I love this recipe
Basic Homemade Bread#27#2#Perfect bread starter. I do add ins black garlic, onion flakes, pepper, powdered onion and garlic. Also used as base for raisin bread. The options are endless.
Basic Homemade Bread#42#1#I like this recipe because it's easy to keep up with and isn't written in a convoluted story format and the website doesn't make you click next page and next page. This website is less clickbait than the other top of google bread recipes. The bread comes out good, if you like a hard crust and soft spongy center. My girlfriend says it's too salty so I'm trying it with half the recipe recommended amount of salt. I thought the salt was fine but I want her to eat the bread too so, less salt. And I tried it with honey instead of sugar, but it didn't look like the yeast reacted to the honey the same way as sugar. The yeast kind of climbed on to the honey but wasn't bubbling, so I put sugar in there with the honey too. I will probably try using more yeast and seeing if that makes the bread more fluffy too next time. This recipe is a good baseline to go off of and you'll probably want to make adjustments to your taste. 
Basic Homemade Bread#27#0#This came out fabulous! Love this recipe, both loaves were fluffy and the crust was perfect. Thank you so much!
Basic Homemade Bread#13#39#The recipe is too salty ??
Basic Homemade Bread#13#5#First bread I ever baked without a machine. It came out great. I'm glad I had years of the bread machine experience so that I knew what the consistency was supposed to be during the 7-minute kneading.
Basic Homemade Bread#17#3#A great recipe! They came out beautifully!! Will use recipe again.
Basic Homemade Bread#17#6#I used 4 cups of bread flour and then added enough whole wheat (Ezekiel) flour to make the dough.
Basic Homemade Bread#4#0#I don't know where this recipe was last year. I scoured the internet looking for a recipe with a 9 x 5 pan. I used 4 cups of white bread flour and added in enough whole wheat flour to make the dough and got two soft, perfect loaves. 
Basic Homemade Bread#5#1#Absolutely love this recipe , thankyou so much this bread is exactly how I wanted my bread to be ??
Basic Homemade Bread#7#0#This is the best bread I've ever made. Found this recipe about 3weeks ago and just made my 7th batch this morning, hubby can't stop eating this.
Basic Homemade Bread#7#0#Can someone please tell me if this can be adapted for a bread maker? I live in hot and humid Florida, and needless to say, the oven is the least used appliance I own. I actually use it to store pots and pans. Would love to be able to make this. Sounds wonderful!
Basic Homemade Bread#7#0#This was my very first attempt to make bread of any kind. It was easy to do and came out perfect. I actually made mine in the air fryer and cooked it at 325 x 18 minutes. The texture was perfect and it wasn't too dense. I followed the recipe exactly except for using the air fryer oven.
Basic Homemade Bread#9#0#I love to bake, so I've tried many different basic bread recipes. All of the ones I've made turn out too gooey on the inside (not thoroughly cooked) or too hard and crunchy. Additionally, there are so many ingredients and it takes forever to make a loaf of bread. This bread is the best bread I've ever had in. my. life. It is such an easy recipe, with only 6 ingredients, and it takes 20 minutes to whip up, aside from rising + baking time. The flavor is wonderful and the smell of baking bread fills the house. 10/10 for this recipe. AMAZING! 
Basic Homemade Bread#2#1#A nice easy recipe, which I always double. Vegan, too, if you don't butter the hot crust when it comes out (which I do!) Our Noble Homestead go-to recipe. Mmmm. Proudly served at the Magic Glamp, with an olive oil substitution. 
Basic Homemade Bread#15#2#Perfect! I am not in any way a professional baker (I am more of a newbie), and this bread is so easy to make! Rather than kneading on a counter, I just kept the dough in the standmixer and used the dough hook.... turns out great! Thank you so much for this recipe! :) The family loves it!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This was the first homemade bread recipe I have ever tried and it was so worth it! This is a very time consuming recipe, but well worth the wait. It's actually a simple recipe that is easy to follow and make; the resting time for the dough just takes a bit. Wonderful recipe! Tastes so good! 
Basic Homemade Bread#5#5#Gerri, the oven may have been to high for the yeast and it died, keep in warm moist area, about 80 degrees. you can put them in the oven on minimal heat but if you do, put them on a large baking dish thats got water on it to keep the humidity up. Dont bake the bread until the bread has risen to the top of the pan, but not over, otherwise the little it will rise in the oven heat will spill too far over the pan. Carrie, sugar is the simplest of the'starches' that yeast needs to form, you can use honey or even corn starch, sugar just allows the yeast to propagate fastest. if you use honey or starch it will take longer. if you use these let the yeast work on the liquid mix before adding to the flour, that gives them the boost needed to really work into the flour. Remember not to put yeast into too hot of liquid mix or it make kill it. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is quick, easy and fool proof. I've made this recipe 4 times now and the loaves are perfect each time. They freeze well too and are easy to slice. Great for sandwiches. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#1#I followed the directions completely and when the bread doubled in size (about an hour or less) in the 2 pans, I took them out (always warm in the oven) and shaped them in the loaf pans and baked at 375 degrees and they did not puff up. I also used all purpose flour.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I actually have a question. Does the sugar in this recipe make the bread taste sweet at all? My family does not like regular loaf type bread that is the least little bit sweet. We do love cinnamon rolls and the such, just not sandwich type bread.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#1#Super easy starter recipe for any nonbakers! turned out perfectly and my family gobbled it up. Currently making more!
Basic Homemade Bread#4#2#Such a great recipe and easy for this beginner to follow. You saved our Christmas! Last year my mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and she's the one that made Christmas with her cooking and baking. Dad has been her caregiver ever since and has been cooking like a champ. My husband and I live 2min. away, and my brother is staying with them and has been a huge help. But none of us were ready for the holidays... Not really Last year I did NOTHING. This year we cooked what we wanted instead of trying to mimic what mom did. Fried catfish and shrimp, anyone?I also was able to make homemade bread and ham for the family. A tradition that's been in place for as long as I can remember and I'm 50. They loved it! Thank you 1000x and happy holidays! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Love this bread, and easy to make. My family loves it too.??
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This bread is super easy to make! Made it for my family and friends and they said it was the best bread they ever had!
Basic Homemade Bread#5#0#I'm new to bread making. I've tried two other breads before this one and this one is my favorite. My family enjoys this bread and it's very easy to make. I did not use a bread pan and my loaves baked nicely. It does not state whether to preheat the oven or not. I preheated it. I will not buy store bought bread again unless I am in a pinch. Great recipe! 
Basic Homemade Bread#1#0#I've tried many white bread recipes and this is the only one I make now. I make this weekly and it's got a lovely texture. Toasts up amazing! Nice and easy and I make croutons out of the end piece. Keeps brilliantly in the fridge and perfect for sandwiches.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Just baked my first loaves of bread. This is a simple and foolproof recipe! Turned out delicious!!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#New to baking. This one was easy and delicious!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Hey tasteofhome fans, I finally found a splinter free quality banneton proofing basket. I used it already twice, it works great and is extremely easy to clean :-) https://amzn.to/333eZke Enjoy your homemade bread!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Wonderful recipe....yummy
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This bread is excellent. Easy to follow recipe.
Basic Homemade Bread#1#0#To Michele: The oven temperature is 375°F.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#easy recipe to follow. I used bread flour and weighted my flour and used rapid yeast. It raised beautifully both times. I also used my proof feature of my oven. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#1#I started baking bread again last June. This was the first recipe I used and it is the base for every bread I've made since. It is so easy to add ingredients or swap one thing for another. Each time the bread has been a success. I've made garlic kalamata olive bread, chocolate granola bread, and several other variations. But at its heart its always this basic recipe. Thanks. 
Basic Homemade Bread#1#0#why is the video different from the instructions written? i guess ill just follow the video..............
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#How many cups of flour is needed in this recipe. It's not indicated in the list of ingredients. 
Basic Homemade Bread#1#0#I have baked Homemade Bread for Many Years. This Recipe yielded me The Very Best Loaves of Bread I have Ever Made. The thing I done Different this time was I used ALL BREAD FLOUR. Historically I used All Purpose Flour. While my Bread always turned out Well, the Crust was very Hard and the Bread was Dense, but I never had any Leftovers. This Recipe and using BREAD FLOUR my Bread Top was Soft and my Bread was Light as it is from The Grocery Store. I was Amazed but I Recommend Trying This Recipe and Use Bread Flour Only. After it comes out of The Oven, Brush the Tops with Melted Butter. I hope You Enjoy Making Your Bread and that it Turns Out Perfectly As Mine Did. Thanks for Providing Home Cooks with A Great Recipe.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#My first time to make bread at home. Simple recipe that turned out PERFECT. Thanks.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Thank you, is this 375F or 375 degrees Celsius?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#1st time I tried it Thank you perfect
Basic Homemade Bread#1#0#Just a question: Do we have to preheat our convention oven for this? If we have to, how much and how long should we set it for?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Great basic bread recipe. Easy even if you are so so at following directions. I left to rise a bit too long but it still turned out like the photo. Not too many bubbles for me on the yeast either, but again, turned out like the photo. I baked 35 minutes. The hollow sound didn't sound hollow to me, it sounded dense to me but then again I don't know what to listen for as an amateur. Either way, it turned out great despite some slight deviations on my part. This really makes you think about wtf they are putting into store bought bread to make it that light texture, talk about diluting the mixture with garbage! The store bread you pay $2 or more per loaf for and is marked up and low quality. It is worth way less than that and I made this quality bread for about 1.66 per batch . 83 cents per loaf at 33 cents for yeast, 2.50 for 5 lb bag flour, divided., at 3 1/3 cups per pound, using 6 1/4 cups. You could get even cheaper if you wanted to buy in bulk but that isn't necessary as you only save a few cents and then you have to make A LOT of bread before the yeast expires. I'd experiment by putting Everything Seasoning on the top of it, Caraway seeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seed pits, the list goes on. The bread is hearty for refined white bread flour and crusty, not soft and easy to puncture than the store crap! Good luck! Youtube: LCatRN 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Great recipe!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I was looking for an easy, foolproof bread recipe that did not require a bread machine. This was perfect. After making it according to the recipe the first time I got brave and added shredded coconut and some coconut extract to a batch. Worked great. Next I tried it chopped toasted almonds and almond extract - super good. Will keep using this as my foundation as I try a few more variations.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#It has become my go to recipe and have used this recipe several times. Love it! Thanks!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#One of my first times making bread and this recipe yielded two fantastic loafs. I was initially worried because the rise was quicker that the recipe said (first one doubled in 50 minutes and the second in 40) and the bread was much bigger than anticipated but overall it tasted really good. Also the recipe doesnt estimate a cook time, for me it was 1 hour and 25 minutes at 190°C
Basic Homemade Bread#1#2#Followed this recipe to the t, it sucked.
Basic Homemade Bread#1#0#I'm now rating this recipe but I've been using this one for the last 3 months- this recipe is amazing. We tweaked by adding raw oats and crushed flaxseed to make it a little more healthy. It came out really well. This recipe for us yielded 2 nice loaves, and when we toasted the slices for breakfast, the flavor of the oats and flaxseed made it even more delicious- it feels like we had it in a café! Thank you for this, we don't buy bread anymore!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#It was my first time to bake bread, the recipe was easy to follow had great results. The bread was perfect my family loved it.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I really enjoy this recipe. It's my go-to. My only question is regarding the nutritional content. It says 1 slice, can you give the weight of one slice? 1 slice can vary in size. Thank you. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#it doesn't say when to add the 2 1/2 cups of water ? 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I made this yesterday and had some today for breakfast. First time making bread and it was awesome. My wife really enjoyed it too and said don't freeze the 2nd loaf because it won't last...
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This was my first ever attempt at baking bread. The recipe was easy to follow and I had fun baking. Great first time exoerience. I mixed my flour with some wheat four and the bread came out perfectly.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Hi. can I omit the sugar in the recipe. we don't like the bread to be sweet. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I am by no means a baker last time I made bread was 5 yrs ago I know this because my mom passed in 2015. This recipe is easy and tastes wonderful. Tip since yeast is the new toilet paper during this virus find a local bake shop and ask them is you can buy some yeast I found fresh and it had expired and worked beautifully just proof it like active dry yeast. Cheer and good luck.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This recipe really surprised me! It was so easy and the results are amazing, far beyond my expectations! It tasted like fresh, delicious store bought (soft warm) Italian bread...this is going to be a new favorite recipe of mine for sure! My husband loved it!!!! Incredibly delicious. The proofing takes some time, but all the steps were very easy to follow. Thank you so much!!! I love it!!!!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I made bread for the first time using this recipe and it was amazing! I used half the sugar but it still was great. This recipe is a keeper.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Thank you for the recipe, this was my first time baking bread and came out really good!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Just finished baking this bread. Easy recipe and great results!!! Have baked other bread (and much more difficult) recipes in the past and haven't had as much success as with this one!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#1#I'd like to convert this recipe for a bread machine and I'm not savvy about how to do that. Can you help me? In doing so, will you test it and advise me of the end result? Thank you. Cynthia
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This recipe is absolutely amazing! The bread comes out super brown and my house literally smells like a bakery! I'm so glad I discovered this recipe before quarantine! To those that are struggling, try again and in my opinion, Do everything in one bowl.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I have never so much as attempted to make something from scratch before. I made this tonight, following the recipe and instructions as closely as I could and it came out fantastic. I am so pleased!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I followed the recipe to the letter, but for some reason my bread came out like a lump of coal, I strongly recommend lowering the temperatures. Trying to get my bread to 200 degrees Celsius internally took a lot of effort.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Yeast seems to be in short supply right now so I found this recipe while searching for a recipe that used only one packet of yeast. I made no changes to the recipe and ended up with two beautiful and tasty loaves of bread. I found the video to be very helpful also. My usual recipe calls for two packets of yeast. This bread takes longer to make, but is just as good. I let it rise in the bowl for raw full two hours and for 1.5 hrs. in the pans.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#question...help anyone pls....i dissolve the yeast and sugar...how long before i see bubbles on the surface first time trying bread 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Just made this and it turned out great considering I didnt have all the correct ingredients. I halved the quantities as I only wanted one loaf and used half self raising flour and half 00 pasta flour as that was all I had and Im pretty sure my yeast was dead as it was out of date and didn't bubble!! But it worked! Only ever made soda bread before so this was a great result for me as a first time bread baker!! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#1#There are much better white bread recipes out there. Recipes that use milk rather than water make a much better bread that is easier to slice and use for sandwiches. Disappointing.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#All the temperatures I think are in Fahrenheit, otherwise I think this recipe doesn't make sense. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#What started as a joke between my mom and my cousins turned into an amazing joke. I made the bread today and it was delicious. Easy to follow and amazing taste. Definitely a keeper!!!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#1#Fantastic recipe! it was really easy. I mixed by hand. I substituted in about 1 cup of semolina flour, since I am running low on strong flour due to the flour shortage . It was fine, texture and flavour were excellentl. My kids LOVED it and one loaf was gone within 30 minutes! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Can't believe for a simple recipe how great this bread tastes. I do use a mixer and dough hook and it turns out fine. The only time I buy bread now is if I'm lazy and looking for a way out? So far I haven't boughten any. One loaf I freeze for the following week, so it's only every two weeks I need to bake. Highly recommend this recipe both for the beginner and seasoned pro.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I absolutely love this recipe. I made this bread last night and family was shocked today because it was so good. They never knew I could bake bread, actually, I never knew I could bake bread. It's awesome! We are making more today so that both my daughters can learn how to do it. ?? 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#i love this video and all this really good bread making advice .I am very ready to make my own bread at home.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is the only bread recipe that ALWAYS works . I followed the instructions exactly using bread flour , combinations of white flour and whole wheat flour, as well as millet or lentil flour along with white flour and it has always risen beautifully. I have been baking bread every 4 days and get 2 perfect loaves EVERY TIME . Thank you for this great recipe .
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This message is for Suzanne: I've made the bread with a standup mixer and by hand. Both times the bread turned out fine. It was just a little easier with my Kitchen Aid. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#First time making it and it turned out great! My family loves it
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Mine was a total disaster, raw in the middle and so dense. I cut the crust thinly off and they were yum. I think the recipe is confusing as i read it 2 1/4 cups of water and 3 cups flour then it asked me to add . Mix till smooth well it was dough at that point couldnt add in any more flour
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This recipe is great! I have never made bread before. Aside from quick breads like banana and zucchini. Its was easy and tastes AMAZING. Suzanne I don't see any reason the old fashioned way wouldn't work. It will just be a bit more effort on your part when it comes to the incorporating. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Delicious but part of one loaf was kind of doughy. Could be my oven it's new and we have yet to figure it out.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Donna, two and one-quarter (2.25) cups of water. Does that answer your question?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#1#We love this basic bread. It turned out perfectly and taste wonderful!! It's a keeper 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#donna I believe it is 2cups 1/4cups water or 9/4 cups
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I have made this bread a couple times and love it.. I only had rapid rise yeast.. So i only had to let it rise once.. I just put all the ingredients in a stand up mixer bowl together and mix and then add my bread attachment and finish adding the flower.. After you mix it and if you use Rapid yeast let it rest for 10 minutes then cut in half put in the pan and let rise and turn the oven on and bake them.. Best bread recipe ever..
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Fantastic bread recipe. It takes our family about three days to go through a loaf of bread so I refrigerated half the dough after kneading it the first time. It continues to rise in the fridge so make sure you put it in a container with room for it to double and a tight fitting lid. Took it out today, punched it down, shaped for the second loaf and continued the recipe from there - it turned out perfectly!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Question it says 2-1/4 does that mean 21/4 cups of water? Or 2 1/4 cups of water which =1/2 cup?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Hi! I love making bread. I used to make it the standard way, I found an old fleishman booklet that had two ways to make it. I like the sponge method. But still my bread (2nd day) is crumbly and heavy. Any suggestions?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Sounds delicious! Can't wait to try. But have a question: Unfortunately I DO NOT have a standing mixer with a dough hook, so is it possible to make this recipe the old fashioned way?. Or should I not attempt it...
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This was my 1st time making homemade bread. Complete success!! It came out perfect.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#loved it and it was easy!
Basic Homemade Bread#1#0#This recipe is AMAZING!!! I am a complete Newbie when it comes to bread. I can make pizza dough like a pro but bread has always intimidated me. Using bread flour in my recipe was my first priority, second was no milk or egg. This recipe was easy to follow and ended up with a bread better than the bakery (my picky eater's words)! I used a dough hook on my mixer and after was pulled together, i hand kneaded it for about 4 minutes longer. The most perfect bread ever!!! Don't be intimidated, just follow written directions fully. ONLY thing I would add is to put the rack toward the bottom so the poof of the bread is in the middle of the oven when it's risen and browning. THANK YOU AGAIN!!! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I never succeeded at making bread until I used this recipe. I highly suggest you follow the link on how to proof your bread. What a difference it made! I never watched the video, I simply followed the written directions.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#So this is a great recipe for ingredients but terrible directions and video. I used the recipe as stated (except I didn't need quite as much flour) but followed mixing, kneading, rising, and shaping instructions from YouTuber bake with Jack. Seriously, do yourself a favor and watch his yeasted bread tutorial then make this following his directions. You won't regret it. I've made bread before but it's never turned out as good as after I used his instructions with this recipe. The combo will reward you with amazing delicious bread every time. Happy baking!
Basic Homemade Bread#1#0#This is really good bread, but I agree, not every home kitchen has a stand mixer. Last year, I bought a Hamilton Beach auto bread maker for around $40 at Walmart. Even has a gluten free setting. Either bake the loaf in the machine, or pull the dough out to shape, proof and bake as you wish. Why, or why didn't I do this sooner? Even a moron baker like me turns out fabulous breads and rolls!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This recipe is easy and l nailed it the first time will never buy bread again
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I made this recipe as directed, turned out almost perfect. I love it!! The next time I mad it I did not have the Active Dry Yeast. I substituted rapid yeast ( aka instant yeas) and the bread turned out even better. I did not change anything except of activating the yeast. Really fluffy and still full bodied. There is a slight change in flavor, it is has a little less yeast smell, but not anything to change my mind. I highly recommend this recipe, especially for the first time baker. this is almost fool proof
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#If this is supposed to be a recipe for beginning break makers (which I'm not) and you make a video to give added instruction...Shouldn't the video do it like the recipe states? In the video she doesn't put the half teaspoon in with the water and yeast, she doesn't show any bubbles on top of the yeast, and she doesn't let it rise a second time. I made this recipe to the best of my abilities, followed the written recipe to the letter, and I'm with the other writers who experienced a fiasco. I don't see how there can be so many rave reviews. What really makes me angry is I WASTED 6 cups flour and a pkg of yeast at a time when those 2 supplies are hard to come by. If I could give this recipe and the author a negative interger of stars I would 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I was super excited to try and make this bread recipe because it was my first time, the process was a bit frustrating but the end result was perfect really liked and so did my friends
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Easy recipe to follow; nice textured bread.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#First time attempting bread. This recipe worked great even with whole wheat flower. Turned out awesome!!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#kyunger - if you are running out of yeast, and still have some flour... look at recipes for Irish Soda bread - it may be easier to get your hands on bicarbonate of soda (bread soda) - so quick, so easy and very delicious! x
Basic Homemade Bread#1#0#This recipe guideline was easy to use with amazing results! The bread is delicious and going on day 2 still fresh and moist. It was my first try, I've never baked bread before and I was thrilled with the results. Try out this recipe it is good! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Just came out of the oven and we have eaten half of the first loaf. It's delicious. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Is Active Dry Yeast and Instant Yeast the same? If not how can I can use instant yeast to this recipe.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#For those not finding yeast...First store it in your freezer. Stops the aging process. 2nd, go to a local food coop or I go to my bakery and by in a pound package. Put in freezer...once opened it goes in glass jar in the back of fridge freezer..coldest spot. Same with if I use gluten to add. I do not buy bread flour. I know how many TB gluten needs to be added to AP flour for my recipes I create.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#My rating has to do with the equipment used. This is supposedly a recipe is for beginners . How many beginners have a dough mixer? Instructions for making the bread truly by hand would be wonderful. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Outstanding and simple bread. The taste is terrific. I have one package of yeast left during the pandemic so we are eating the bread sparingly. Nobody has any yeast! Great bread.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#What is bread flour? Can all purpose flour be used? I've never made bread before so any help would be greatly appreciated! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I had seen this recipe and then lost it so was going from memort. I used 2 pks of yeast instead of 1- it was fantastic!! Chewy, soft, and that yeadty flavor I love. This makes a wonderful base for cinnamon rolls- hint hint!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Is there a high altitude adjustment available? We live at 5800' and would love to make it 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#The house smelled amazing while this was baking. Absolutely thought I had died and gone to heaven with my first slice. It also makes very good toast. You will never need another white bread recipe
Basic Homemade Bread#1#0#Bread tastes amazing! However, time is misleading on the recipe since it needs a few hours to rise. Any other time I read recipes completely before making them but I was in a rush and didnt until half way thru... I only jad about an hour to let it rise and then put in oven. Still turned out great and everyone loved it. I did add just about 1/2 c of whole wheat flour.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Amazingly good
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Paige- whole wheat flour absorbs more water than white white flour. So, either you need to increase the amount of water or decrease the amount of flour. I'd you want to keep a similar texture, you can try substituting 50-70% of the white flour for whole wheat flour. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Whole wheat flour is NOT interchangeable with all purpose or bread flour. If you want to make whole wheat bread, find a recipe written specifically for whole wheat. The rise times will be completely different and the flour to liquid ratio will be different, as whole wheat absorbs liquid much more than white flour. Hope this helps!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Super easy! Tastes great!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I dont know what happened with mine! I followed the recipe and when I baked it, it didnt rise and it's still doughy. I used whole wheat flour. PLEASE HELP 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Tasty, easy to follow recipe! My family definitely approved. Yum delicious ??
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Fantastic recipe! I followed the recipe and it turned out prefect. My first time making bread, I did YouTube on activating yeast and how to tell when you have knead enough. Very good flavor and great for beginners.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I haven't tried this recipe yet. I am wondering if whole-wheat flour can be substituted? 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#A very good recipe for nice sandwich bread. Obviously, the amount of flour and water depends very much on the temperature, humidity, and elevation, so it would have been helpful to be very specific about what the dough should look and feel like at each stage, since this is a beginner's recipe. But it makes great bread! If you want rustic bread, I swear by the recipe on the King Arthur flour website. It's absolutely foolproof. I'm a mediocre baker, but I've never messed up that recipe, ever.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#ok everyone, with bread, more flour = more dense, less flour = more fluffy. I do 1/2 recipes and i rarely use more than 2.5 cups of flour once you learn this, this recipe, along with your breadmaking skill in general, is great.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#The amount of flour is a SUGGESTION. I used to make bread every Friday and just getting back to it so I knew that. Depending upon the humidity sometimes I use 6c or 6.5c or 5.75c. Finish adding the flour during the hand kneading process and you'll never go wrong 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Absolutely one of the best, lightest, tastiest white breads I have ever made (and there's been a few). Thank you to Steve for the suggestion regarding flour, started out with 6 cups and added as needed/kneaded ended up with the whole 6 3/4 cups. The only thing I did different was I used a couple of tips I had from various cinnamon roll recipes that work. The first one being heat liquid for yeast in the microwave, starting with 1 minute then add 10 to 20 more seconds until you reach 110-115 deg f., then add yeast and 1/2 tsp sugar. While mixing ingredients for dough heat oven to 200 deg f. then turn off and allow to cool slightly, then put the dough in there to raise (door closed). I use a metal bowl and cover with a damp towel. Left in there for full 2 hrs and when it came time to put into pans I covered them and put back in the oven until it was time to preheat for baking. I haven't had an issue with dough rising since I started using this method, as long as yeast is before best by date. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#To anyone who has trouble making bread where it comes our hard or too dry. Making bread is not an exact science. The amount of flour you use isn't going to exactly match what is in this recipe. (or any recipe) The amount varies depending on temperature and humidity. If it's cool and/or dry in your house, you will use less flour. You will have to adjust by feel and texture as you knead the dough. Don't add all the flour at once. It also helps to have a small pan with some water on the rack below the bread pan. This adds additional humidity while you bake the bread. (Giving a nicer crust) 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Love this bread! My wife and family also love this delicious sandwich bread. Definitely doesn't require all of the flour. I used around 5 cups. Everything else is spot on though. To quote Holly- I felt like an instant bread expert. I have already made this recipe 2xs. The first time with all purpose flour, came out dry and spongy. The second time I used baking flour, and the bread was perfect. Crisp yet chewy. Thank you. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Sorry but the recipe is wrong for those above Sea level.... Reason is not enough water which will evaporate the ratio should be 1 cup of water to 2 cups of flour per loaf of bread. Oil can be higher ratio. The bread when it rises will create its own heat. SO if you have dry flower that is why... change the ratio of water to flower for number of loafs.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#My dough turned out hard and feels like the 6 cups of flour is too much. The video looks like its super easy and runny. Mine is hard and like a puzzle comes off pieces by pieces. Am I doing it wrong? I followed the recipe..
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is the first bread recipe I have made that did not come out rubbery or extremely dense. I was impressed. After watching the video, I realized my dough was not the proper consistency according to the flour and liquid ratio in the recipe. I only used 5 1/4 cups of flour, as 6 was far too much and did not mix well. I will make this again as it was delicious. I feel like an instant bread expert. Thank you!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#used olive oil instead
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Turned out pretty good for my first time making bread ..I've made bread before but it never worked out ..I basically mad bricks until now ?? .and this recipe turned out pretty good
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I had to add some water and a little bit more oil to the recipe. I was not getting the soft dough consistency with the amount of water in the recipe. I added warm water a little bit at a time until a soft dough formed. It ended coming out great though. My boyfriend loved it. He made a sandwich with it and said it was perfect.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is a great fast bread recipe. And to answer one of the questions below, yes you can use a stand mixer. I used the whisk for the initial mixing and then switched to the kneading hook for the 8-10 minutes suggested in the recipe. Turned out fantastic.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Can you make this with out a mixer and have it still come out fine?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#My bread used to always come out either really dry or way too dense and chewy. This is the first recipe that gives me consistently good results! Now I use it as a base and make little alterations to experiment in the kitchen. I've got a lemon pepper garlic bread rising now! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Am I understanding that I am supposed to let the dough rise twice as the directions say in step 2 and also in step 3? So far this has been a very simple and easy recipe to follow for this first time bread baker.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#good quality recipe and bread :) thank you.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I use this recipe as a template. As an experienced baker, I can make numerous modifications with a recipe this basic. To answer some other concerns, it is helpful to start with the yeast and two cups of flour and add the liquid ingredients before you add salt and let sit about ten minutes. This fully activated the yeast and can improve results. To the person whose bread came out doughy, have you confirmed your oven temperature is accurate? Often, home ranges can vary in actual temperature.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is a five star recipe all the way its a perfect recipe every time and everyone loves it including me!!!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is a wonderful recipe to make. It's easy 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Ok i just used your receipe and the bread is doughy in the middle im going to cook it a little longer then let you know if i like this recipe
Basic Homemade Bread#1#0#Have been using this recipe for years and I love it! Always consistently good bread!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Do you need to let the yeast wake up before you start mixing in the remaining yeast?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#My wife and I made this bread tonight....AMAZING! Unbelievably awesome. First time making it, is and our three kids are hooked! Thank you!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Best recipe I have tried and I have been trying to find a really good bread recipe for a long time. The bread is light and fluffy. Thank you. My search is st an end
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I MADE YOUR RECIPE AND IT IS THE BEST. I LOVE IT. MADE SOME THIS MORNING AND WE ATE AWESOME SANDWICHES FOR LUNCH. YES. THANK YOU AND BLESS YOU.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Just finished making up this bread recipe. I've attempted to make bread in the past with no success. I'm crossing my fingers and toes that it turns out. I'd love to have found an easy bread recipe that I can repeat week after week. This way I can keep my family healthier as well as save some money on our grocery bill each month. We are practicing staying debt free and although we can afford it, we stick to a very strick budget. Gotta lunch them pennies where we can. Bread is on the rise now. I'll post a review on the final outcome. Stay tuned... 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This was such an easy recipe and the result was awesome! Im super impressed. I've tried a bunch of recipes and this is a winner! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I don't buy bread at the store. All the crap you buy there and most of the flour mixes have bromate. SO I finally decided to buy bromate free flour and try to cook..(( wait is it took or make or make??) Make bread. It was easier than I thought it would be to make.. Its rising right now.. Kinda huge.. I realized though that I don't have any bread pans so.. this is going to be an interesting experiment... Going to toss it on a cookie sheet and.. eat what happens. I like that the recipe was so easy. I don't like the ads I have to scroll through in the middle of the page. I'll try this again next week.. I think 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I followed the directions perfectly and had a blob of sticky dough. I added more flour after turning out onto wax paper because of the lack of work area I have, had to use the stovetop. I added even more flour. after failing in the use of yeast 4 times, I sure hope this bread tunrs out good! it is rising as I type.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I followed exactly what the recipe says and this bread turns out perfect every single time!! I had never made any kind of homemade bread before, and this was so easy. It does take some time simply because how long it takes the dough to rise, but the amount of time actually making and working with the dough is not long at all. My family loves this bread, and I have actually had some people purchase loaves off of me as well. I was even told that it is better than bread from Amish Country!!! Thanks so much for this recipe! I will definitely recommend it to anyone that wants to make their own bread!!!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Is it possible to make this recipe with Almond Milk?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I have been making this bread every Sunday for about a year now. It's a fantastic sandwich bread. I make 2 loaves every Sunday for sandwiches for the week. I brush some butter on the tops of them as soon as they're out, let them cool for a couple hours then slice them and stick them in the freezer ready for sandwiches :)
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Is it possible to use this recipe in a large food processor?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I have made it several times now. It's perfect. Thank you.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Love this bread! I'm making it for a second time due to the fact my family can't get enough! I don't mind because it's super simple to make and comes out perfect every time! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Good, basic white bread. I bake a lot of fancy breads and thought I would give this a go and it came out fine. I also made it out of a pan and just did two free standing loaves. It had a nice crust and the bread itself had a nice'sopping up' power with my tomato based sauce. It was a little heavier than store bought, mass produced,'half-baked' store bought garbage, but that is obviously to be expected. We went through both in less than 2 days. I'd make it again. For those having issues, following directions is key. Use bread flour. Be patient. Put away your bread machine. Temp your water. Let the starter work. Don't use too much flour....only what it needs. (You probably won't need all 6 cups) If this isn't taking you a good 3-4 hours to make, you're doing it wrong. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Another amazing bread recipe. They came out perfect!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#My favorite home made bread ever! Easy to make and Lovely warm with butter. I use the 3 tbsp sugar as stated in the ingredients list and not the 1/2 cup it says in the directions though. That bit was confusing at first lol. I just follow the ingredients list and proofed the yeast then added the other ingredients to that in my stand mixer adding the flour a half cup at a time till the last half cup. Then I just kind of throw pinches at it till it looks right Haha!! Beautiful bread! Thank you :)
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I've made this several times. I added, sausage, cheeses, garlic, onion, and herbs. And it is absolutly amazing! Try it, you will love it. Thanks for the recipe 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#stupid easy to make! I forgot to grease the top of the bread, but that didn't seem to affect it much. also, for those curious, you can definitely replace canola oil with olive oil, and regular sugar with brown sugar, or truvia brown sugar blend if that's all you have. if using truvia blend, make sure to follow the sugar to truvia conversion in the back of the bag.! thanks so much for this awesome recipe, will try making these on a weekly basis and see if i can save money on store bought bread! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Thanks for this! Looks so easy and delicious i will try to do this one!??
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Delicious! I am extremely impressed, it turned out great and it was my first time ever baking experiment! Has anyone tried putting seeds in it? Just wondering if that would work. On another note I suggest using olive oil instead of canola, it gives the perfect kick!
Basic Homemade Bread#1#0#Literally the only thing I've baked, looked kinda weird and I forgot the canola oil but it was still yummy. Good recipe for a valiant first attempt. Hopefully I'll remember the oil next time
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#My very first time making bread and it came out great! I honestly don't think I'm ever gonna buy store bought white bread again. It's super easy and cheap to make. Mine was a little on the dense and salty side so maybe I'll use a tad bit less salt but it's still sooo good.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Oh. My. God. This non-baker made this bread today and it is fantastic. I used a little less than 6 cups of flour, followed the directions to the t and shaped them into round loaves, because why would I have 2 loaf pans???! I greased 2 9x9 cake pans with bacon fat shortning and smeared them with a little of it before I popped them on the oven. Thirty minutes later with a ten minute cool down and boy is this bread yummy. Super delicious and not real heavy. Great recipe! Thank You TOH! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Absolutely the worst bread recipe ever. There was way to much flour it was like the Sahara Desert in my mouth.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#New at this homemade bread thing, enjoying it very much but this recipe has been the best by far, texture was awesome, best that I've made, i save this recipe on my phone instead of trying to find it again, and plenty of thumbs up from everyone 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Bread tastes really good, and it was fairly simple to make, but it crumbles a bit and was hard to make into sliced bread. It didn't rise as well as I would have liked. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Excellent bread with the exception of an overkill on the salt. Should it not be 1 tsp not 1 tbsp. If not why?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Just came out very nice.my everyday breakfast is now changed to bread.thank you very very very very very much.wish you the best
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Question, could I substitute self rising flour for the AP? THANKS!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Made this bread for the first time for Easter. Nice workout kneading the bread for sure. I did use a little over two tablespoons of sugar and two teaspoons of salt based on other reviews, and used an egg wash. We had a couple of slices with bolognese for dinner and even the end slice was tasty! This is a great recipe that I will make again. Need to just have the time to let it rise.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This message is for Cathy. I had the same problem with my bread machine. The solution is to take the dough out after the knead cycle and let it rise in your own pans. It seemed like the machine was not allowing it sufficient time to rise. Bake according to the directions. Good luck!!!!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Bread turned out great, could I use honey to sweetin and result
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I have bread machine and would like to know if this recipe will help me make better bread in machine..my bread comes out too hard and heavy
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Omg! I've always sucked at bread UNTIL this recipe! Awesome it came out great. My daughter kept asking for more! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I've gone through many recipe's trying to find one that was simple, good texture and taste great. My search is over this is the one I've been looking for. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Great recipe, best bread I've made so far - turned out exactly as you'd hope and has risen perfectly. Topped mine with shallots and grated cheese before baking for a bit of added flavour. Definitely recommend you try this one!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I am a Baker by trade, but when I'm home I like to use this very simple recipe. I do use an egg wash and I reccomend a very light sprinkling of flakey salt. It is delicious and beautiful. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This recipe is to simplistic and not detailed enough. By not letting the yeast sit I believe it caused the bread not to rise high enough. This resulted in 2 loafs that were shorter than they should've been. I also reccomend a egg wash before cooking. The texture of the bread was sorta like cornbread and a little mushy but not to bad really not great or terrible. it was very crumbly and hard to cut thin slices. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Recipe reads simple; the recipe is easy to understand. Does the recipe go well with a bread machine?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Did anyone else even come close to using 6 cups of flour? I used met before. And it came out perfectly
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I made this bread 2 different times. Once I didn't realize that my yeast was no longer active and ended up with a very dose loaf; but my kids still loved it. Even I did! Then I made the second round with an active yeast and it was much better. My youngest, while having his first couple bites, send to me, Mom... this is the BEST bread.. seriously.. oh my gosh... you should be a chef!!! Hahahaha.. I totally took credit too lol. Thanks for this easy recipe. Definitely a winner around my place!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Have been baking bread for over 50 years, this recipe, by far has the best taste, texture and easiest recipe I have tried! Thank you for sharing Sandra! Today was my second time using this recipe, I know I will be using it very often!
Basic Homemade Bread#1#0#Just wondering if you can substitute the AP flour with whole wheat flour? Thanks!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This recipe is the best! I don't bake ever, and I consider myself a complete novice in the kitchen, and I just made this for the first time and I had to eat half a loaf it was so good. I threw in a couple handfuls of dried cranberries, OMG, make this if you want to impress people. Too bad I only have my dog to impress LOL, she had a slice
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Omg the best! I used this recipe for the first time last night. The bread came out PERFECT! So moist and delicious, my daughter couldn't get enough. I used a glass loaf dish and followed the directions step by step. Will definitely use this recipe again 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Question for the author (or a successful user of this recipe): Are you baking at 375 degrees in a dark or light pan? Other bread recipes I see run around 400 deg. and a light pan. Which do you use at 375?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#First time making bread was a week or so ago. I decided the best thing to do was keep it simple.. and this bread turned out amazing. My GF was pretty impressed to see that I had made bread too. Here I am again a week later, making it again !! &lt;3
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Yummy ;)
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I baked this bread earlier today, and it was so easy. It turned out great and is very delicious! My 2 year old loved it.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I loved the recipe . And it was my first time ever making it my family and friends injoy eating it.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Easy to follow, turned out really good, my family loved it. I did bake both loafs together and baked it for 40 minutes instead of 35, I have convection oven. Otherwise, perfect.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#FULL DISCLOSURE: Not the best bread recipie I've came across in some 40 years of baking bread by hand, but it does get 5 stars because it's so easy and reliable.I use bulk Flour, Sugar, and even Yeast. No need tp buy premium ingredients here.TIPS: Proof the yeast water and Sugar for at least 10 minutes.Make SURE the water isn't over 115 degreesDo NOT over rise or over bake.It works fone for me! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This recipe was given to me by my neighbor. I thought I would make it today and it turned out horrible. OMG, it was terrible. The bread did not rise at all. I'm not sure why this happened ? I'm not sure why everyone has given this bread recipe five stars? If I could I would give it zero. I have made bread before and it always turned out great. I followed the directions to the tee. I am thinking I should have used bread flour instead of all-purpose flour. I am very disappointed I'm planning on throwing this recipe in the garbage. I plan on making bread from the youtube channel (Jenny Can Cook.) Now, JENNY can make delicious bread and it turns out good every time. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is an excellent recipe...Its so easy and so good. I halved both loaves (after the first halves) to make twists, then egg washed and sesame seeds. Beautiful loaves.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Love this bread. I make it at lease twice a month. Comes out perfect every time.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I love this bread. Eady to make and wonderful.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is THE best, and easiest bread recipe. I made a few adjustments but the foundation recipe for ingredients, measures and prep/cooking were straight from this recipe. [(I used bread flour instead of AP flour, olive oil on place of the canola (that's what I had on hand), and threw in some savory spices to give it a kick and it rose up better than any recipe I'd ever used, plus I put a dash of olive oil in the dough because I read that bread flour dough can be dry.] 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is any easy bread recipe to make. I cut my the next day and it sliced pretty easily, not breaking all apart.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#My husband and I love this bread! It doesn't take me all day to make, which is a big plus, and it tastes great! I have it for breakfast, make my husbands lunch with it and serve it at dinner when we want bread. I don't use quite so much sugar or salt and the results are still great. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Real good but i couldnt get it to fit to well in my microwave but once i put it in a bowl it fit just fine, it tasted even better with cinnamon on it, trust me!!!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Simple and absolutely amazing! I have baked bread homemade and from scratch all my life as I am a Jewish woman. This recipe is easy and simple but gives you the finest of bakeries taste, bakeries that I'd rate outstanding at 5 stars. Incredible and an absolute must try!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Thank you!!! Thank you....my bread came out great. I even had extra dough to make cinnamon bread. This is my go to bread. No more store brought bread.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#If you are looking for bread your grandma made you fond it. I believe make great rolls cinnamon rolls . I used my stand mixer to make the dough , I have been making bread for some time this is the best I have found .Be sure to let your bread cool down you my not be able to cut it until next day . I don't how old my yeast is it came from a food bank in a bag we put in a pizza jar and keep it in the relegate . 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is a delicious bread recipe. If you own a KitchenAid stand mixer, use the dough kneading attachment and set the timer for 8-9 minutes instead of doing it by hand, unless you want a workout.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This was my very first time making bread and it turned out perfect! I really love the ease of this recipe! I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to make bread!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Excellent
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Really yummy, and easy to make. I'd recommend halving the salt though. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I keep yeast in the freezer and use as needed. I'm using yeast from my freezer now that is over five years old. Still very active. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I'm new to making homemade bread and have a question. I tried this and followed this recipe exactly, the top and bottom of loaf were brown and baked well, but the middle was still too doughy to eat. What can I do? Thanks!!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Old yeast isn't necessarily dead. I've used rapid rise yeast that's close to 8 months beyond the expiration date and it worked perfectly. However, if the yeast was stored in a warm area either in your home or in a warehouse somewhere along the line, that could kill it long before the expiration date. Dissolving it in water that's too hot will do it in too. Best to have the water 105? to 110?. If you set it out to rise is in a cold room, that will prevent any rising. I warm the oven a bit before I start and turn it off after a minute or so when it's around 100?. That seems to work well for rising. If the dough doesn't rise even after it's set in the oven to bake, then the yeast was dead. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I made this bread tonight.It turned out great!! I did take advice of a previous review and raised my dough in an oven preheated to 200. You turn the oven off before putting your dough in. I Love this simple yummy bread recipe!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#No mention of preheating oven before baking. I know it's a given thing to do but not all of us are bakers! I googled just to make sure that I should preheat my oven. Bread turned out delicious.. This one is a keeper! A little sweet, will use less sugar next time. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Shareel, it could be that you had old yeast. If it is old, your bread won't rise whatever you do. I would suggest trying the recipe again with fresh (new) yeast that hasn't expired. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Ann do you put the bread dough in the warm oven to rise my e-mail is owen.jc@yahoo.com
Basic Homemade Bread#1#0#I used this recipe when I decided to start making bread again ~ perfect! I preheat the oven to 200 degrees then shut it off as I'm kneading and the dough rises perfectly! My husband is always happy when I'm making this and prefers it to store bought bread! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This recipe is awesome! I made it just like the recipe stated. It was perfect. I will be making more today. My whole family loved it. For people who can't get the bread to rise, try putting it in front of a small heater. It helped mine rise a lot. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#First time I made bread. Was very easy and came out perfectly. Thank you!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Fail!?? followed the recipe to par but the bread didnt rise at all. Not sure what eent wrong but the flour didnt rise before or during baking. Any suggestion or idea why?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I am not experienced with yeast breads at all. This is the second one I've made. I followed the recipe exactly and was rewarded with two beautiful and delicious loaves of bread. The crust came out just right crispness and the texture on the inside is delightful, soft, delicious. I am so proud of how they turned out! Easy to follow directions, will definitely use this recipe again.Edit: My family tried it later in the day and all 4 of them lost their mind over the deliciousness, and I received specific compliments on crust and texture. This bread is really a hit! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Scale of 1-10:Ease of prep: 9, super easy, just toss in a bowl and mixCooking time: 8, it's about average for breadsTexture: 8, still a little fluffier than I like but the crust isn't as flakyMoisture: 9, has enough that I didn't feel like a slice NEEDED some kind of spreadFlavor: 6, sweeter than I like, less sugar next time. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I have never baked anything before.. the homemade bread recipe was excellent and easy. Thank you
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Omg! I made this bread for my fist time to make bread and it was ausome. Thank you for letting me use the recipe. I'll use it many more times. Thanks Again D from Texas 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This recipe worked great! I have been looking for a good basic bread recipe to go with some amazing jam we are giving away this Christmas. I looked through the comments and took folks' common advice and it turned out really well! Bloom the yeast in the warm water with the sugar, mix and let proof for 10 minutes before incorporating the other ingredients. Also - hand knead this dough. I am on my second batch having done the hand kneading as opposed to the dough hook this time around and it has turned out even better than the first time. This is an easy, no-fuss recipe that turns out great. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is my go to recipe I am a novice bread baker and was a bit nervous if this recipe would work out. I am glad I did it's a hit every time the only thing I would like to share is the first time the bread lost moisture and so was a bit hard but then a friend told me to put a tray with water on the bottom rack to create a steam oven I am glad I got this tip the bread comes out moist on the inside and crusty on the outside! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#My family loves this recipe. I use it to make rolls! Perfect crusty but soft bread. Love it!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Can I safely halve this recipe (particularly the yeast)? There's just me and my beloved that I'm baking for so I don't want two loaves (yet). 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Thanks
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#is this right on the salt 1 tablespoon salt seems like a lot
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Didn't think I would get it right, but somehow I did. Then I started doing twice the recipe and ended up with substituting some flour with wheat bran and try different shapes. I ended up with baguettes, subs, bread and buns. All in one cooking session. Even tried some maple & cinnamon bread which ended up great! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I usually fail miserably at anything connected with yeast but I made 2 successful loaves with this recipe. I took the advice of previous reviewers and mixed the water, sugar and yeast and let it stand to proof it. I also looked up other tips online like How to tell when bread is risen enough (not just doubled ) How to tell when bread is ready to bake How to tell when bread is thoroughly baked . With those tips I produced 2 nice loaves. The only thing I would have liked is a finer texture. I've only been able to produce that in the past using the sponge method. I will use this recipe again. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Steph, try using warmer water - 120 to125 degrees. Air humidity and temperature are most important. Your DIL.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#OMG first time I ever baked bread, this recipe is the best. first time And easy to follow Instructions will make it more of it. And tasty nice and fluffy
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I love how easy it is to follow. Too bad I didn't follow it:( I forgot to put the oil in. Didn't even clue in until I was reviewing cook times! We shall see. I will re-review once I've tried it. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I've been making this bread for the last 6 years and my family LOVES it! This bread is easy to make and tastes wonderful too. This bread is a staple in our home! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Great easy recipe and a first time bread maker like me can make. Great tasting bread and so easy to make
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#The best bread recipe that I have ever used. Beautiful and very delish. My now go to bread recipe!!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Making this recipe for the second time this week! It's easy and delicious. I mix the yeast, water and sugar in the bowl first, wait ten minutes and then add in the salt, flour and oil. I use a blend of bread flour, whole wheat and ground flax seed. It makes loaves that are light and not too crusty. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I created an account just to rate this excellent recipe, which I followed exactly as written. I know some people have commented that it's important to activate the yeast, but I didn't do that. I just did what the recipe said and it worked out fine. I also used regular old all-purpose flour (some have said it's important to use some kind of special bread flour), and it was perfect: light, fluffy, with a crust that wasn't too hard--exactly what I wanted. I'm not sure what happened with the folks who called this recipe terrible and said they ended up with bread that was inedible. All I can say is their experience is nothing like mine.Highly recommended! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I tried this recipe once and it was terrible. The second time I used 1/4 cup water and 1 tablespoon sugar. Dissolved the sugar and then added the yeast. Cover the yeast and let it set for 10 minutes until frothy. After that I added the rest of the ingredients and kneeded the living carp out of it. Everything turned out perfect this time. Light, fluffy, and yeasty. It was delicious. Just active the yeast in this way and it will turn out fine.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#First time baking bread and this recipe was so easy to follow and bread came out delicious. Crust was just right, perfect height and density. I used 6 1/4 cups of King Arthur's Unbleached Bread Flour and added a touch of honey. I will be making my own bread and rolls from now on using this basic recipe. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Turned out great :-)
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I just made this bread and it turned out marvelous! However, I feel like it has some important steps left out that you need to know if you're not an experienced bread Baker. First of all - to activate your yeast - you need to put the warm water and yeast and sugar alone in your bowl. Stir it well, cover it, and set it aside when it's frothy looking - those foamy looking bubbles mean the yeast is ready to go. THEN add all the other ingredients. Otherwise it's a great basic recipe. Make sure to work the dough long enough - I do half with a dough hook and my KitchenAid and half by hand on a flour dusted counter. It needs to feel really smooth and stretchy. Good luck! It tastes delicious and a perfect texture! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Literally the worst bread I have ever made. I can't believe it got so many positive reviews. I made this twice. The first time I thought it was my oven that had ruined it, or maybe the yeast wasn't good enough. However the second time through I had the right ingredients, fixed the oven and I had the worst results. It is best to try another recipe. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Awesome awesome awesome bread. So good as a sandwich, killer as mop up bread with gravy. Even better with garlic seasoning and butter lightly toasted! I have made this bread six times now and everyone loves it, thanks so much.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I have made this twice and after the first rise don't knead the dough. It makes it VERY dense. On my second bake It was half as dense, but it was still dense. If you don't knead it enough before the first rise the glutton won't build enough to become light and fluffy. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Worked out great
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Surely something was left out of this recipe. Followed recipe exactly and it was terrible!! Don't know how it got any stars. Wasted ingredients 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Love this simple recipe This is my 1st time baking white bread at home. I have baked spelt flour recipes a couple of times and came out good. Love the taste, Instead of adding only all purpose flour I added 3-1/2 cups all purpose and the rest spelt flour, also added a tblspoon of flax seed powder. I have never loved white bread like this before. Next time I will definitely use all ... all purpose flour :). I am a beginner in bread baking, this recipe really made me confident abt my bread baking skills. Thank you.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Was super easy to make and turned out well! The directions were simple and easy to follow.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I've made this bread several times already! The first time was good, and has only gotten better each time! I concur with Ryan below about using bread flour (I used King Arthur), but I use my wife's beloved Kitchenaid stand mixer which more than meets and exceeds the challenge of kneading. I also divide the dough into thirds (and can even go for four small loaves), and it does keep for a few days, IF it lasts that long! :-D The final bread product, when made with bread flour, is a good crumb, nice chew and wonderfully crispy, yet soft, crust.A WONDERFUL beginner's recipe! I'll experiment with adding herbs and other flavors to this dough! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#When you say 1/4 ounce of yeast, does that equal to 7grams of yeast? I have access to dry yeast by the packets. Each packet contains 1 g of dry yeast. Do I use 7?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Making this bread right now not sure if it will turn out because I used olive oil not canola oil used pizza crust yeast Its what I had available at the time .
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I actually signed up on here to leave a review. I NEVER leave reviews for recipes I've tried. But I made this bread and this was the first time I got bread RIGHT! The dough was stiff yet workable, it raised well and I actually got 4 loaves instead of just the 2! It tasted delicious and this is the recipe I'd pass down to my generation of family! It's THAT amazing! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Simply outstanding. I've made this recipe more than once -- several times at high elevation in Denver, another time at/near sea level in Houston. I never leave reviews for recipes, but felt the need to pay it forward on this one. PRO TIP (based on experience and experimentation): use UNBLEACHED bread flour if you want a softer crust. I've used standard, all-purpose bleached flour, but the crust ends up too hard. It's almost too difficult to cut through it in the end. I much prefer the softer crust. As for the rest of the recipe, follow it. It's perfect. I mix it all by hand using a mixing bowl and, literally, a regular fork. Yes, my arm begins to ache by the time I've added the 4th cup of flour. Also, if you are a bread-baking newbie like I was, I used advice found online to determine if my bread had risen enough on both the 1st and 2nd rise. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#AWESOME, easy bread recipe! Loaf just came fresh out of the oven. ...yum! Perfect ingredient portions. Even works with Himalayan Pink Salt for regular salt & Pure Cane Sugar instead of regular. When I divided the dough in half; made that one loaf and divided the other half in two, put them in refrigerator for future use. Thanks for sharing!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Could this recipe be doubled ?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#My family and i are absolutely in love with this recipe. I only halved the recipe and came out best. It's the bomb. This is my go to bread recipe from now on 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This recipe was a total fale in my books not only should you just dissolve the yeast in warm water and then it says to ad your sugar and salt right away with the flour. Did they forget the part where you should let your yeast stand . I prefer to take warm water with suger dissolved in it and then ad the yeast and let it stand. Then after 10 minutes i will mix in the flour salt butter and water and or milk. Mine never even came up an inch. I threw it away
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#guys this recipe worked my family loved it so from now on we prefer making our own bread at home save money and way delicious yes guys thanks to the owner GOD BLESS
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This was perfectly simple and delicious! I made it just as written. I started with 5 cups of flour, but easily made it to 6.5 cups while kneading the dough. I only have one bread pan, so I put half of the dough in a loaf pan and made the rest as a round loaf in a casserole dish. Both turned out great. I'm sure we will be making this again soon! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I had no idea what I was doing making bread on my own for the first time! This recipe is so easy for the beginner, and the only problem I had with the bread was how quickly my family scarfed it down! Thank you so much!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I have never been able to bake bread. It was always a waste! I am loving this recipe. I could tell by the dough that it would be good but it WA really great. After the 3 cups of flour, I did what the recipe advised and added the extra flour 1/2 cup at a time and 51/2 cups did the trick ( plus extra for kneading). I made a nice round loaf, a regular sized loaf and 6 cinnamon rolls that I made by adding a mixture of sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, butter and a bit of flour and vanilla and heaping it on top of the rolls before baking. Everything tasted delicious. I'm hooked! Will be baking this bread alot! Thank you! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Simply delicious. My husband loved it too.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#It was delicious and easy to make. I would recommend putting an egg wash or butter over the loaf before cooking to make it look better though.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I accidentally doubled the amount of sugar, salt and oil (I tried to cut the recipe in half... mistakes were made), but the bread still came out looking and tasting amazing! I imagine my accidental adjustments just made for a more flavorful loaf, which is nothing I'm complaining about. I would definitely make this again. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! I have been searching for an easy picture perfect yeast bread recipe for 50 years. The first recipe I tried I threw away the loaf. This is fool proof. AND YES I DID MODIFY, used only 5 cups flour then extra for dusting, only used 2 tsp of salt. If I could add a picture I would. I drove in a thunderstorm to take slices to neighbor because I needed a witness as how wonderful it was ! A man would marry you in a heartbeat if you served this.LOL
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Very easy. I think there's a bit too much sugar though. It could do with, maybe, one tablespoon less. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#My family and I Love this recipe for bread .. 1st try and success. For starters, start here. I watched a youtube before attempting to get the process down.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#First time bread maker from scratch. OMG - this is as good as .... chocolate! A MUST REPEAT recipe. Simply outstanding! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is essentially the Betty Crocker White Bread recipe from the 1950 cookbook, which I no longer have :( So I was happy to find a similar recipe! The only difference I can see is the Betty Crocker recipe called for shortening or lard rather than canola oil. I compromised and used butter LOL :) Also, if I'm not mistaken, the Betty Crocker recipe says to bake at 425, not 375. I'm going to give this 375 a go this time and stick to the recipe as written. Other than the butter, that is...because it looks like it's a winner as written!I just want to say I'm a touch annoyed by reviewers who leave one star, then go on to explain how they changed this and that and had bad results and won't make the recipe again. How about actually following the recipe, and if you don't, it's a little unfair to one-star the posted recipe when it's your changes that probably really failed. Just a thought ;)And yes, one tablespoon of salt is the correct amount. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I used this recipe to make my first bread in the oven (I've used a bread machine before). Easy to make and tastes great. I used 5-3/4 cups of flour. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I had never made bread before trying this recipe. It is so good! I'm now making loaves for my neighbors for Christmas! I also added cheese and jarred jalape?os and was worried that it would mess up with not changing any of the other measurements -turned out delicious! turned out delicious Thank you for this recipe ! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I just made this amazing bread and it tastes great! I only needed 5.5 cups of flour and it still came out quite dense. I baked in the oven one level up from the bottom with a cookie sheet on the bottom level. This keeps the bottom from getting too burnt.It came out looking exactly like the picture. My kids love it too! This is great cause I hate breadmakers since the belt eventually slips on them and they make more noise. Now I can make bread with no preservatives!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I love this recipe, and so does everyone whose tasted it. I had to start dividing the dough into three portions and put the loaves into smaller pans since my family nearly inhales it every time I make it. I don't even need to adjust the baking time, they turn out beautifully every time. As for the amount of flour, I think the recipe is only showing you what you will need before you start, like say you only need 5 cups of flour for the bread, what happens if you only have that much flour? You can't knead the bread so well cuz you ran out, I tested how much I end up using after my dough is ready to be kneaded, and I use almost another whole cup of flour. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I want my bread to look like the one in the picture. Mine wasn't golden brown but I'll try it again. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#PERFECT!!!I've tried 2 other easy recipes over the last 2 days and BOTH went in the trash! I finally found this recipe, and while reluctant, because of the last 2 failures, I decided to give this one a try. I am sooooo glad I did! Not only are the ingredients simple, but so is putting it together and making it.I did make a few minor modifications based on some of the reviews. I used 5 1/4 cups of flour instead of the 6 1/4 to 6 3/4 cups it calls for. I found that the recommended amount of flour was just entirely too much. I also used vegetable oil instead of canola, because that's all I had.This bread is wonderful! My husband, son and mother ate a whole loaf in two hours! The other loaf is almost gone today.It is so moist and soft. I can't believe it turned out this good! I made everyone french toast this morning and grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch. We will no longer spend $3 for a loaf of store bought bread. I've finally found my tried and trusted recipe right here!Good luck everyone! Enjoy this awesome recipe. Your family will thank you for it! :)P.S. This site should allow us to post pictures, to prove how our recipes turned out. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Love this recipe, the bread was delicious. We doubled the recipe and used extra virgin olive oil instead of canola oil, it came out perfect, I just decreased the salt as olive oil has a stronger taste as canola!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is exactly the same as the recipe I use in my bread machine, just use half the ingredients and add an egg. Heaven. One trick I do that really makes a huge difference is to spray surface with Pam instead of dusting with four. Also spray your hands, butter would work just as well
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Absolutely love this recipe! I have made it several times now. My husband and I have stopped buying bread and only eat what I make :)Linda that posted Nov 15, 2016...The olive oil will make it salty and taste a little weird. I would recommend using either canola or vegetable oil (corn oil may also work, but haven't tried it). As long as you use the right type of oil one tablespoon of salt is perfect. I also like to grease the bowl and pans with Un salted butter. It adds a nice slight butter taste. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I was disappointed in this bread. I wonder if the 1 tablespoon of salt is correct - I don't think I have ever added 1 tablespoon of salt to anything I have made. I thought this bread tasted too salty. I didn't have canola oil so I used olive oil and sprayed the pans with Pam - not sure if those things had anything to do with the salty taste. I will not be making this again. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Great recipe. I like it better with 1.5-2 tsp of salt. I also added some chopped jalapeno and cheddar cheese to one loaf. It was great!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Can this be made in a bread machine?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I have tried my entire life to make bread like this and I felt like Queen for a day when I actually succeeded! Your recipe made learning it fun! Thanks for making a recipe that finally made me a success!!!!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Oh. My. Jesus!!! Such a simple and perfect recipe!!! The bread is awesome. Soft on the inside, a bit of crunch on the outside... mmmh mmmh mmmh!!! I made mine with a little less flour too (About 5 cups), and added raisins. Thank you so much for posting this :)
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is by far the most simplistic bread recipe I've ever come across. I've tried so many bread recipes but I could never memorize them because of so many steps involved and the bread never came out exactly as the recipe's image or as it should. This recipe came out perfect, my kids and husband loved it and I was able to memorize the steps so I can put my spin on it. Today I made it for the second time with 3 cups white flour and 3 cups wheat. Peerfect! It's a keeper!! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Works great. Though I only need 5 1/2 cups of flour or it becomes too dense
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This recipe is awesome! I have never made bread before and was so worried that I'd be terrible at it because my mom never got the hang of it. The only thing I did differently is I used instant yeast instead of the active dry, because when I bought yeast before finding this recipe I didn't know which to buy. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T. The bread came out perfect. I can't believe I made perfect bread on my first try! And it's really yummy. I'll be using this recipe from now on and I'll be making a lot more bread from here on out! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Easy!Mine is rising the first time right now. Thinking about making it into cinnamon rolls.To the person (lucylinecm) questioning the recipe, it takes about 6 1/2 cups of flour.Update....it was horrible. Didn't rise, maybe the yeast. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#this bread is the most consistently fantastic bread i have ever made-and i make a lot of bread, i love the attention i get for this wonderful bread! I don't deserve the fuss really because it is dead easy to make ha ha :) 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Loved it! I've never made bread before and this was so much easier than I thought it would be. Great by itself or for sandwiches. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I made this bread today and followed the recipe pretty close including the rising times, except for a couple ingredients. I changed out 1 1/2 cups of the flour for whole wheat flour and used instant dry yeast 2 1/4 tsp (= 1 pkg yeast) plus I added a little more yeast (about 1/2 tsp) because of the whole wheat flour. I also sifted all the flour after measuring. It raised beautifully and turned out very good. It's going to be my go to recipe for bread. Enjoying every slice! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Tried this recipe today. super easy and my loaves came out really well..lovely super soft texture..Thanks a bunch for the recipe !!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This recipe was so easy and my family loved it. I have a question about making mini loaves. What would be the cook time?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#My go-to recipe for basic white bread. Easy and turns out well every time. For a soft crust, brush with a little butter when you take it out of the oven.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Thanks a lot for the easy to follow recipe and videos. I'm a beginner bread maker and your video's really help me. Thanks again from NZ 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I double this recipe and bake 4 loaves at a time because my family & I love this bread so much! It is a delicious recipe! Garlic cheese toast, open pb & j sandwiches, and good Ole buttered toast are just a few of our favorite ways to eat it! My daughter just eats it plain and untoasted she likes it so much!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Easy & simple recipe to follow. Delicious every time!!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Currently enjoying this toasted with jam and a nice cup of coffee. Great recipe! I found the sugar unnecessary so eliminated that and it tastes just as good. Also decided to just wing it on the flour-- add it until the dough was ready, no more no less, and that worked better than the first batch.I've never baked bread before and this was the perfect beginner's recipe! So excited to try new twists on it as well. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Great bread, easy recipe, and it rose really well with a crusty outside and fluffy inside. I made a loaf and some buns for burgers with the dough and they were perfect. I read a couple reviews about the flour total being wrong, the recipe does ask for 6 -63/4 cups in total and I added that much and it was fine. It asks for three cups first and then additional flour after as much as needed. Followed the recipe as is and it turned out as I would have hoped. I will make this again and pass it on.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Followed the recipe as it is works fine tnx
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Why does the ingredient list say 6 cups of flour, but they only tell you to put 3 into the dough, (plus some extra). I put in a little extra to make the dough not stick, but that was no where near 6 cups total! I hope I'm not making this bread all wrong!! Please fix the directions! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Great recipe. I used half whole wheat and half white flour. I also used olive oil instead of the canola oil called for. This recipe calls for one tablespoon of salt. I thought that was too much, so I used less. I should have added the full tablespoon the recipe called for. The bread was still very good, but when I make this again, and I will add one tablespoon of salt. Thanks for the great bread recipe.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Tried this recipe for the first time and I was very pleased with the results. I can't offer any suggestions for improvements. Very simple recipe. If you follow directions precisely you will get some really great bread. Hope it stays fresh for a couple days. Definitely worth making again! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I've tweaked this a little to make it better (for me atleast ) I use 3 teas yeast ,only rise once ,it makes it a lot less dense ,I also changed the temp around some(lower like 10 degrees) ,and it seems to make it even softer ,but still same time 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Is there a bread machine version of the classic white bread?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I'm rating simply for the other reviews. I'll try this next week. As for answering the questions from cdj516 - whether the dough can be halved _ yes I can't see any issues. As for freezing the dough - can't say for sure. I don't usually freeze bread dough. What I do is bake the whole recipe, cool to room temp and divide each loaf into three. For us that is the perfect size for a day or two. I wrap the sections individually in plastic wrap, then place into a freezer bag. I grab out of the freezer as I need it. Thawing isn't an issue... takes 10 minutes or so. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I am rating this based on looking for so long for a easy basic bread recipe. This is exactly the basic bread recipe I have been looking for!!! I have not made it yet but will very soon, I am however concerned about how much bread it will make, I have a small household so I am reaching out for advice: has anyone tried to make only half of the recipe and also can this dough be frozen if I make the full amount and only bake one loaf of bread. I love the other idea's of what I can make with it. Your suggestions are great. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Excellent recipe! For those asking about flour weight, 142 grams = 1cup and 5oz = 1 cup. I measure my flour on a scale for anything I make from scratch. It makes all the difference.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Great recipe for bread! Definitely nostalgic of when my mother used to bake it for us. This recipe is enough for two loaves :)
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I like to substitute honey for the sugar. Turns out great!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Turned out really good. I should've formed mine better, I just dumped it in there so the top was a bit funky ;D I did halve this recipe. My first attempt at making bread and it makes me want to try other recipes! Really tasty, I'm glad it was a success! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#My whole family loves this bread and begs me to make more. We have significantly cut out store bought bread and instead make this. We have also used it as pizza crust and that was great too. We made two pizzas out of one batch of dough, but found the dough too thick - a half recipe/batch could make two pizzas (or whole recipe for one loaf of bread & two pizza crusts). Plan to try to add in whole wheat flour soon.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#The BEST recipe for homemade white bread I've ever tried. It is moist and delicious with a hint of sweetness. It is perfect! My only regret is the fact that I LOVE it ... Hence I eat it ~ waaaay too much. :) 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I made this recipe today and used 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat. The loaves turned out golden brown on the outside and a lovely light brown on the inside. The bread was delicious. The recipe was easy to follow and I will be using it again. Thanks for posting!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I would like to make this bread but with less sugar, would that be possible?
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Great basic bread and just what I was looking for. I substituted olive oil for canola oil and didn't notice a difference. I also turned one loaf into focaccia bread. I put half the dough in an oiled 13 x 9 lasagna pan and sprinkled the top with minced fresh garlic and sliced olives. I let it rise the second time and baked it alongside the regular loaf. 10 minutes before it was done I sprinkled shredded cheese over the top. Very tasty.Also used two tbsp sugar instead of three with no problem. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Really simple, quick and tasty bread. I used 5 cups of ultragrain white flour and found it to be the perfect texture with great rise - as long as my kitchen was decently warm. I let the loaves rise beside my crock pot while it was cooking some soup on low and that seemed to do the trick. The taste was really lovely, just a hint of sweet and not too yeasty, with a nice crumb and golden crispy crust. Will be making this bread often!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I have made this bread twice with bleached flour and whole wheat flour, both turned out perfect and taste great. Easy recipe for a beginner bread maker. Thanx for the recipe
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Really needs to have weights for salt, sugar and flour. Tasty recipe though.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I followed the suggestion of using half all purpose flour and half bread flour. I also needed 6 full cups of flour. I made one loaf of bread and rolled the other half out into twelve cinnamon rolls. My dough raised beautifully. I have a proofing setting on my oven, and let the loaf rise for 40 minutes, which is about how much it took me to make the cinnamon rolls. Cinnamon rolls took about an hour to rise. Turned out great - very easy dough to work with, and this bread will go into my recipe rotation.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I have a son who doesn't like eggs, butter and milk, so I went looking for a bread recipe that don't have eggs, butter or milk. The bread that i usually make has butter and milk. I tried this recipe and had great success, I have added it as my standard bread recipe. Thanks to Sandra Anderson for submitting the recipe and to taste of home for publishing it. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I have made this bread several times over the past month and this is what I can tell you. (1) the first time I made it, I used all purpose flour, as the recipe called for. The bread came out really good. (2) the second time I made it, I used bread flour. The bread came out really good. In both, the texture was good, but just a bit different from each other. Then came (3) and this time, I used a combination of 1/2 all purpose and 1/2 bread flour. Results? Perfect phenomenal bread. This had a great texture and taste and this will be the way I make it from now on.Ok, now, I like a few others, have found that 5 cups of flour proves to be enough flour.When I made bread tonight, I made 2 small loaves and a pan of cinnamon rolls. My husband and grandson loved them. They said the taste and texture were perfect.
Basic Homemade Bread#1#0#I created an account just leave a review. I am a novice baker (baking for about two weeks now) and my husband has been begging for YEARS for a homemade bread recipe. I finally broke down and Googled homemade bread recipes and this was the first one I found. And, WOW. It came out so golden brown and delicious! It rose beautifully and the recipe was so easy to follow! My husband and I promptly devoured half the loaf once I pulled it out of the oven. Oops. I am totally making pb&js with this bread for tomorrow's outing for me, my husband and our son. Fantastic recipe! Thanks for sharing! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#reserving judgement until the b0oss weighs in ;))
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I found this recipe doing a search for an easy beginners bread recipe. I love this recipe. It raises for me every time. I have recently begun to experiment with it by making rolls and cinnamon rolls. Very simple, very versatile recipe and it will stay in my favorite recipes notebook. I will say to the nay-sayers, get a candy thermometer and check your water temperature. My co-worker told me the easiest way to fail at bread making is to have your water or milk too hot when you add your yeast. Also, check your yeast expiration date.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Use this recipe in my bread machine and it never fails if you follow machine and yeast directions!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Excellent recipe. Many years ago a friend told me to buy a candy thermometer and to measure the temperature of the water to mix with yeast, usually 110-115 degrees. This makes bread making much simpler.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is a very good basic bread recipe. If yours didn't rise, it was because of reasons other than the recipe. I agree with others who commented earlier that either your water was too hot, yeast too old, or you made a mistake somewhere in your making the bread. Try again, following the directions. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Excellent tasty bread even my grandson liked it and very easy to make.Going to make more tomorrow!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Use 2 envelopes of dry yeast.. I did rose great I make challah and it uses 4 to 5 cups bread flour and requires 2 pkts yeast.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is the recipe my mom used for years for bread and cinnamon rolls. It always came out perfectly. I can't make it to save my life because I hate making yeast bread. It really does take 8-10 minutes of kneading, I don't have the patience! The water has to be the correct temperature and the yeast has to be fresh. If your yeast is expired, toss it. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I've baked bread all my life. This is a very good basic recipe for bread and it spin-offs like cinnamon rolls. Some people I notice complain of the bread not rising either you got your yeast too hot with the water and killed it, or did not take into account rising tempuratures or altitude do just make sure your yeast does not get too hot or cold and you should be fine. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Excellent recipe!! Very easy to follow:)) and super delicious!! Definitely using this recipe again:)), mixed 2 different flour types, worked as a charm!!Thank you!!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#6 cups of flour would have been way too much I stopped at just over 5 cups, plenty!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This bread was excellent. I'm so excited to have found this easy recipe. I used honey instead of sugar and half whole wheat half all purpose flour delish. Thank you 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Easy to make and substitute whole wheat for white flour.It was delicious.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#My whole family loved it! I made two loaves and they were gone in two days!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Its not even finished yet n it already smells amazing!! Ive tried a couple different bread recipes on here and i love them all!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Very simple, yet awesome, recipe. Everyone could smell the warm, delicious, bread aroma from outside. We all loved it.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Such an amazing recipe!! Just made it and my mom and dad loved it and so did I! Very simple... a little lengthy process but totally worth it!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I love this site. It has awesome receipts that I can make for my family.... Sooooooo happy
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#super easy an so delicious
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Thank you for such a marvelously easy bread recipe. Made this a couple of times. I use all whole wheat flour and it makes a bread that tastes pretty much exactly like Outback Steakhouse's bread. Helps with my diet because I try to cut preservatives and artificial ingredients out. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Made this today and not only is the recipe super easy it turns out so delicious. A big hit in our house. Thank you for a wonderful bread recipe!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Great bread... I just substitute 1 cup of water for 1 cup of milk, and stuffed one with shered mozzarella and the other with cherries.. Yummy yummy.. Thanks for this great recipe
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#So good! And easy. I ground up a cup's worth of steel cut oats and flaxseed in a coffee grinder and added it in place of another cup of flour (trying to eat healthier). It turned out great and nice texture. This bread rose much better than another recipe I used and looks beautiful. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Delicious! I used a heating pad to help the bread rise.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Best bread i have ever made. Tastes amazing!! My family loves it. So simple to make and very little ingredients.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is way easy to make! I LOVE IT!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Excellent and easy bread recipe. I put water on the top of the bread when it comes out of the oven and wrap it in a towel to steam This creates a softer crust. Also, use 1/2 wheat to 1/2 white flour for a wheat bread.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Very simple basic bread recipe. Also good for fry bread. After letting it rise and beating it down simply form into rounds and fry until crispy brown .
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This recipe is very good thank you. Mine didn't rise well but that was my fault my house was to cool.A question for the person before me Cmolina1. Why on earth would you give a recipe a 1 star because YOU didn't read the recipe? 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#For some reason i thought it said 3 cups flour. I was wondering why i had to double that. Aside from me reading directions wrong, its a fantasic basic recipe. I would say add a tiny bit of spice to the water before mixing. I added a pinch of garlic salt, onion powder, and italian season and just wow! Such a small amount of spice can go a very long ways!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I've always had trouble finding the perfect bread recipe, but I can finally quit looking. This simple recipe bakes up perfectly and never disappoints! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I love this! I started with the recipe as written down and it turned out beautiful each time! I have started making this with whole wheat flour (half all-purpose, half whole wheat), and making a cinnamon raisin version I read in one of the reviews that is awesome! It is my first and last bread recipe and is sooooooo good!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#We LOVE this bread! It's so simple and easy to make and it tastes great. My husband can't get enough (and that's saying a lot since he's not much of a bread eater). 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Easy peasy!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This is my first homemade bread recipe and it will be my last, there is no need to look elsewhere! I don't knead it the 8-10 minutes as directed, usually 5 minutes and it rises fine each time. It will not rise as much with sea salt but I like the taste a little better. Believe it or not, I am losing weight while eating this bread but only allow 2 slices per day with little other carbs...so you can lose weight and eat delicious homemade bread! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#The first time I tried this my yeast was expired, the water was too warm & I didn't wait long enough for the yeast to dissolve. Needless to say, the bread didn't rise and wasn't very good. While the bad loaves were in the oven I started a new batch with fresh yeast in the right temperature water & showed some patience letting it dissolve, the result was 2 beautiful loaves of bread! Such an easy recipe - if you follow it! I can't wait to try some of the suggested variations. 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I really can't get over this bread. I made 2 batches every week. I usually substitute 1 1/2 cups of AP flour with whole wheat. It's just lovely. Actually, I just made some except after letting it rise, I took one loaf worth, kneaded in about 1c. raisins, then rolled it out rubbed on some butter and sprinkled on cinnamon sugar (1 1/2 tbspn cinnamon, 3tbspn brown sugar), and rolled it up, let it rise and baked like the recipe says, and ohmygoodness. Best raisin bread I have ever had. Just came out of the oven. mmmmm 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#My first time, and it was perfect. Slices wonderful for sandwiches, and delicious. And myfamily loved it, they said more, more, more.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Two loaves were gone in one day (family of 6). I've used other recipes, but this was hugely successful! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Delicious, very easy... we don't use sugar, we use honey instead, and it is just divine!! My loaf pans are slightly smaller, so I'm able to break this into 3 even loaves. I've made it twice already (6 loaves total) Never buying store bread again!! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I've always had issues making home made bread. This recipe has not let me down yet! The only thing I do differently is form the loaves by hand, make a few slashes at the top for decoration, and sprinkle a little corn meal on a greased cookie sheet. It makes the loaves come off the pan easier. These loaves go fast! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Absolutely the easiest and most delicious bread. Came out perfect the first time. OMG, my husband and kids had the first loaf down by the evening. Will be making this on a regular basis. I have had terrible success with my bread maker, although I will continue to try to find the perfect recipe for it.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#This was the first time I have tried homemade bread and I will never try a different recipe. It made 2 very large loaves and I can't stop eating them! I only have 1 loaf pan so I decided to just forgo them and put both of my loaves on a non-stick air bake cookie sheet. They came out beautifully. I went about 32 minutes until the internal temp was between 180 and 190. Immediately after they came out, I brushed the tops with olive oil. It really softened it up, but still has just enough of that homemade crunch. I'm excited to try variations including whole garlic cloves, apple and cinnamon, chocolate pudding mix and chocolate chips and herbs and cheese. We may never buy store bought bread again!! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#great recipe! My bread turned out perfect! I do beat my bread down twice though to get a more even mix. Also, in the recipe it says 3 cups and on the side of the recipe it says over 6 cups. The 6 cups is the correct one!! If you cant get your bread to rise, it's because you're missing over 3 cups of flour!!! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I use to have issues with my bread rIsing. It was due to the yeast not activating properly..now I have no issues at all...make sire your water temp is close to spot on usualy luke warm will do the trick.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Love it.
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#My bread didnt rise. I followed to the tee. :-[
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Very simple recipe - I love that it only has 6 ingredients and uses all purpose flour. I did a cost analysis, and this recipe costs me less than buying store bought bread. It comes out to about $0.05 per slice, which is pretty cheap. And it really doesn't require much effort. It does take some time, but most of that is from rising and baking and I can still do other tasks while that's happening, so I think it's worth it. I'm definitely going to be using this as my go-to bread recipe from now on. My family loves it! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#Huge hit with the family!!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#easy enough for my kids to help! smells great baking and tastes wonderful! yummy!
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#The first two loaves I made were gone in less than two days. My kids were in love. Then I made two more and those were gone almost as fast. I have now made a total of 8 loaves and we stopped buying bread from the store. I cook it 30 mins, baste them with butter and then cook them 5 more minutes. Then I baste them again when I take them out. I didn't have canola oil so I just use vegetable and it's amazing! 
Basic Homemade Bread#0#0#I have made this recipe a few times now and it has become my go to recipe. I generally always end up using a mixture of whole wheat and regular all purpose flour and it turns out great. I use this recipe not only for bread,'but also for homemade calzones and stromboli. It really is a great all purpose bread dough. 
Zucchini Cupcake#4#0#I rarely bake anything that doesn't have chocolate in it, but this recipe looked so good I had to try it. I followed the recipe exactly, and the cupcakes and frosting were scrumptious! The only thing I would do differently would be to start checking them after 15-18 minutes, as they weren't quite as moist as I would have liked when I removed them from the oven after 20 minutes. But I am definitely adding this to my list of favorite recipes!
Zucchini Cupcake#2#2#I'm not sure that I'd reviewed this recipe before, so I'll do it now I used half and half cream instead of the milk for the frosting and followed recipe for the basic cupcakes. However, I baked 7 cupcakes and three 5 x3 loaves I iced the loaves right away and thinned frosting with about 2 to 3 Tbsp. more half and half cream. This is a real winner of a recipe as it had been in one of the contests! 
Zucchini Cupcake#6#0#Excellent recipe! I did sub nutmeg for cloves and baked in greased floured tiny cupcake pan...came out perfect at 12 minutes..350°....a keeper!!!
Zucchini Cupcake#4#0#Yummy! Even my vegetable-hating grandchildren loved these cupcakes! They were moist and tasty even without the caramel topping. With the caramel, they were out-of-this world! I'll have to plant more zucchini! 
Zucchini Cupcake#3#1#This was one of the first recipes I made when I began subscribing to the Taste of Home magazine in the 1990's. I made the cupcakes for a outdoor concert I was going to on a summer evening. Delicious, moist spice cupcakes with a wonderful butterscotch icing. They were a big hit with my friends. Couldn't eat just one. 
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#Absolutely scrumptious!! Definitely in the Let's do this again category. 
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#Made in a 13x9 glass pan 30 min at 350. Powdered sugar not on ingredients list and didn't have any, so just put carmel sauce on top. Very yummy. 
Zucchini Cupcake#4#0#I have been making these zucchini cupcakes since the recipe first came out in 1997, and it remains my favorite to this day. I make it exactly as written - it is perfect!
Zucchini Cupcake#2#0#I have an amazing zucchini muffin recipe that I have been using for decades. But I wanted to branch out. I was glad I did! I liked the almond extract and the caramel frosting is terrific. The texture is amazing too, a nice not too dense, but thick enough consistency. Cinnamon and cloves are just right and not overwhelming.
Zucchini Cupcake#2#0#Really enjoy these cupcakes. The caramel frosting is such a great combination with the almond and spice flavor of the cake.
Zucchini Cupcake#2#0#Great flavor. Made 23
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#Very good!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These cupcakes were great
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I made these last summer when zucchini was in adbundance. Did make one change - used lemon juice and zest instead of the orange juice. Lot of leftover frosting - but why am I complaining? Delicious.
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#Made these for Christmas! I love these!!! The icing is super easy and comes right out of the pan without sticking to it at all. I put it in a ziplock bag and cut off the corner and wala! Perfect!
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#These cupcakes are absolutely delicious! We always have so much zucchini in the summer, this is a keeper, I made the recipe as stated, just doubled it, and still feel like there aren't enough to go around. :) 
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#&gt; I totally loved these cute cupcakes... but I turned them n2 holiday breads - I used the zucchini, crushed pineapple, raisins & either chopped walnuts or pecans (salted) - WOW - they were so good - I made 35 and all of them got sold at the Christmas craft festival this year! I will make these again... both as cupcakes and breads!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Since we had many zucchini squash in our garden this year, I used some to try this recipe.I wasn't sorry I did, they are delicious! 
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#Great Frosting to use on other cupcakes and cakes
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These cupcakes are excellent! Batter made 22 cupcakes instead of 1 1/2 doz. Only change I made was added 1/2 cup raisins to batter at end. I almost increased the frosting ingredients slightly.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#The icing was the best part of these!!! The cupcakes themselves were quite delicious but the icing definitely topped these off.
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#The zucchini cupcakes were very moist and flavorful. I usually see zucchini cake paired with cream cheese frosting, so I thought the caramel frosting was really unique, and delicious!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#The zucchini muffins were okay; however it was some of the best icing I have ever tasted! The icing was beyond amazing!!!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Awesome! I loved the taste and texture of the cake. The icing was very sweet, but still delicious! I had a lot of icing leftover, so I would halve the recipe for the icing next time. This is definitely a winner!
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#Love, love, love the frosting. I wouldn't necessarily consider this a cupcake, more like a quick bread; however, it is tasty. I love the orange juice in the batter. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#just made these tonight and was very impressed. I didnt double the icing recipe but did increase it a bit.. It made enough to ice 1 1/2 dozen cupcakes and then some! Yes, the icing was to die for. I increased the shredded zucchini alittle cause I wanted more vegies in them. I will definitely be making these again!
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#My neighbor across the street (Carolee) and I both just happened to make these cupcakes! Carolee followed the recipe exactly except she used yellow squash (instead of zucchini) and used 1 3/4 cups grated (instead of 1 1/2 cups) ... she also put toasted walnuts on top of some.I made them a bit differently. I used vegetable oil (instead of canola), I used 2 cups of grated zucchini (instead of 1 1/2 cups) and I put the batter in a greased and floured 9X13 cake pan..... baked at 350 degrees F. for 25-30 minutes. I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the icing and, after icing the cake, topped it with 2/3 cup chopped and toasted walnuts.Both versions were extremely tasty!! The cake is moist and not too sweet, like some zucchini cakes ...... the icing tops off the cake perfectly. My cake tasted almost like carrot cake .... probably from the extra cinnamon in the icing.We will both be making this cake again!!! Five star rating for sure!
Zucchini Cupcake#1#1#These were fabulous. Loved the frosting, but cupcakes are fine without it too. Didn't have any almond extract so finely chopped about a 1/4 cup of almonds in it. Maybe that's why mine were great without the frosting too, almonds added a touch more flavor and a bit of crunch. 
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#Very nice recipe . I like that the consistency is cake like rather than like many other recipes which are heavier and taste more like a muffin. The icing tops this off beautifully and takes it up a notch for sure. I peel my zucchini as is our preference. People that dislike zucchini would not even know zucchini is in this when peel is not present as it just imparts a moisture to the cupcake .Raisins or pecans would be a great addition to the batter.
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#I'm always looking for every possible way to use extra zucchini in the summer time! This recipe was a wonderful sweet treat! We really enjoy these! 
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#Loved these cupcakes! Not overly sweet or heavy. Most of the sweetness comes from the frosting, and the cupcakes wouldn't be near as good without it. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Just made these following the recipe exactly. Very good! It is also a very good, not-too-sweet muffin without the frosting. Adding raisins would be an option. A keeper recipe! 
Zucchini Cupcake#3#1#Took these to our Bunco game night. They were a hit. I didn't have any orange juice or almond extract, so I used lemon juice and lemon extract and they were very good. Moist and flavorful. The frosting was just the needed touch of sweetness to the cupcake. Will definitely be making again 
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#I made these yesterday and they were fantastic! The frosting was amazing and really took it over the top.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These cupcakes were bland. The frosting too sweet. They taste more like muffins instead of cupcakes.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I have made these numerous times and everyone loved them! The frosting is the so-called icing on the cake! Love these!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Delicious!!
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#I took these cupcakes to work and they didn't last long. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#My sis made these. I would have never made a zuchinni cupcake but I sure am glad she did. Now one of my favorites. The combination of flavors is perfect; the frosting is delicious!
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#Delicious. Yummy frosting. I have been making these for s few years now. As soon as zucchini appears in my garden, the cupcakes are never far behind!!!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Made it in a 9x13 and came out great. Hard to beat spiced cake and caramel frosting. This will definitely be made again
Zucchini Cupcake#0#1#This is the second time I've made these. They are very tasty and moist. It took 16 min for 18 cupcakes. I used 1 cup sugar and I found them still a little too sweet. I omitted the cloves because my family doesn't like them. They are delicious even without the frosting! 
Zucchini Cupcake#1#0#What a great way to use zucchini!! The frosting is to die for-- and it's not even chocolate!! I double it and pile it on each cupcake! I can easily get 2 1/2 dozen from this recipe Then there's more room for frosting!! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I made this recipe as written two times. I have also just made them with whole wheat flour. They are good either way. Frosting is delicious but not necessary.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These are delicious. They are light textured and the frosting is easy. They are not too sweet, either, just right! I am so happy to have this recipe. Everyone who ate one thought they were just yummy! I will make again and again. Always need zucchini recipes. Thanks!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These are delicious! I didn't have orange juice so I substituted equal amount lemon juice and it worked well! The frosting is delicious! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Added applesauce for oil and orange extract for juice...awesome and nice and moist. The frosting is very good. Will make again!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These were so yummy! I used ground all spice, instead of ground cloves. Worked great!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I ate some of these. They were delicious!! She added about a 1/2 cup -3/4 cup of bluberries. Really good!!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#What can I substitute for the orange juice.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Yummy! Very easy too!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These zucchini cupcakes were a hit! I took them to a potluck and they were gone in minutes! I added 4 oz. of cream cheese to the batter because my frosting didn't whip up like I would have liked! These are definitely worth trying! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Really yummy cupcakes. I would make these again. I liked the flavor of the frosting, but it didn't set up very well. Maybe it was soft because my butter wasn't cold enough? The cupcakes are delicious without frosting. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Very tasty moist cupcakes. The caramel icing is out of this world with the spice cupcakes. I will definately make these again when I have an abundance of zucchini!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Very moist! My family loved them. I didn't frost the cupcakes and we ate them as muffins with soup. Definitely making them again. They freeze well too. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Super yummy! I love these cupcakes, and the frosting is delicious. New favorite cupcake recipe.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Wonderful! Moist and delightful. Unfortunately I was out of almond extract so I had to use vanilla. Next time I'll definitely use almond; I'll also reduce the cloves to 1/4 teaspoon as they're a bit overpowering for my taste. I'm sure I'll be baking these again. The caramel frosting is delicious and plentiful! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#This recipe is fantastic. This is one of the children's favorite after school snacks. I have made it as a birthday cake as well. Also, if you are trying to cut calories I would have to say it's great without the frosting too! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#We tried this recently as I have a surplus of zucchini. My boys loved them. I had no problem with the frosting as is, make sure you let it actually get down to lukewarm if you are having problems with the consistency. Setting it in a pan of cool water can speed the process. I baked mine for 20 min. for the first 12, then 18 the second as I found them a little dry.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These are awesome!!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#1#Oh my! These are outstanding! I followed the recipe exactly, although for the frosting after cooking the brown sugar/butter mixture, I transferred to a small mixing bowl and placed in an ice and water sink bath while beating in the powdered sugar (used 1 1/2 cups). 18 cupcakes, fluffy caramel frosting. OH MY!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Theses cupcakes are awesome. I am always looking for ways to use zucchini and these hit the spot. The only change I made was that I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla and I think they were just as good. I'm not a huge fan of almond extract anyway. The only other note is that the caramel frosting was more like a glaze. I added the 2 cups of 10x sugar and didn't want to add any more for fear it would be too sweet. Otherwise, this is a keeper! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I had prepared this recipe QUITE sometime back! I prepared it again! I have adjusted this recipe by adding 1 Tbsp. ground Navel orange and I also added 1/2 tsp. each of all-spice andnutmeg to the other spices and dry ingredients listed in this recipe! I used 1 cup shredded zucchini with 1/2 cup unpeeled chopped tart apple, rather than 1-1/2 cups zucchini. For the icing, I'd used 3 cups confectioners' sugar-the 2 cups didn't make for a good spreading consistency! I'd also just melted the butter with the brown sugar-I didn't cube the butter.I used evaporated milk and started with 1/4 cup milk, and gradually added UP TO 2 Tbsp.more milk to achieve a desirable spreading consistency! I did have to stir the frosting with a mixing spoon to make the icing pliable and easier for me to spread. I also baked cupcakes 25 minutes to make sure that they were golden brown and really baked! Thank you,Virginia LaPierre, for sharing your recipe with Taste of Home!This recipe IS a wonderful way to use zucchini! delowenstein 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#This is just excellent. I followed the recipe exactly, except I just had skim milk so added maybe 1 tsp of cream. When it was time to cool the frosting, I put my pot in an ice bath and cooled it that way, then kept the pot in the bath while beating in the powdered sugar. I maybe added 1 cup, and it almost was too stiff, unlike other reviewers' concerns that they could not get it to a proper spreading consistency. Thanks for the recipe .. I will definitely use it again. Oh, and it made 9 large cupcakes/muffins. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#What a great recipe. The cupcakes were moist and the icing was delicious.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Delicious.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Delicious Cupcakes!!! Moist. Frosting is yummy!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#They were good, I like cloves, but don't love them, if I did these might get 5 stars. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Delicious, will be putting the frosting on a zucchini cake I am making
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Made this into a bundt cake, came out delicious! The orange juice makes it taste so good.Going to make into Zucchini bread, grandkids loved it!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Holy Cow!!! These are amazing!!!! So good.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#De
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I didn't put on the frosting. They didn't need it, my husband thinks frosting is too sweet and I have to watch my sugar intake so a win-win all around. This will be the zuke muffin recipe I'll use from now on! Thanks! (Oh.. I did use only half of the amount of the spices.. our preference..) 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#This is by far the BEST cupcake recipe out there! The frosting is the crowning glory to this moist cake. Do not hesitate to make these, only be prepared for everyone to ask you for this recipe.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#this recipe came out yeaer ago, when my 21 year old son was in preschool. He loved these so much he wanted me to make them for his class on his birthday. Well, needless to say, a bunch preschoolers and the word zucchini did not go over too well. But he was delighted!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#The caramel icing is great!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#A great fall treat!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These cupcakes are yummilicious!! My dad who doesn't usually like caramel frosting, actually said they tasted good! I had a little trouble though...couldn't get the frosting to thicken. Thanks to your grandma for an amazing recipe! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#very good and tasty cupcake
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Oh man, these were SO yummy! I was surprised that even my picky granddaughter loved them (she ate two and was mad when we wouldn't let her have another). I used vanilla rather than almond extract. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Oh man, these were SO yummy! I was surprised that even my picky granddaughter loved them (she ate two and was mad when we wouldn't let her have another). I used vanilla rather than almond extract. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I am rating this recipe as a family treat every year zucchini is out of control in the garden. The family and work crowd loved it last year. The recipe passed out to all. This year though I am making mini cupcakes for the calorie conscious.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I made these for a party at work, and they flew off the table! The creamy frosting adds just the right touch to a fabulous fall treat!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These cupcakes were a great hit at a recent get together! The caramel frosting combined with the cinnamon spice mixture in the cupcakes, make this a perfect fall treat!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Excellent!!! I doubled the recipe to make a sheet cake and a couple of variations to lighten up (hopefully) the recipe. I subbed half of the eggs for whites, half oil for apple sauce, reduced sugar and added more apple sauce. I didn't have orange juice so I added 1 Tablespoon of Lemon Juice per batch. Kids loved it... that's all I need to know. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Made this recipe as written except used vanilla instead of almond extract in the cake part. So good! Moist & sweet. It made 2 dozen cupcakes. I didn't think there would be enough frosting but I only used half because it's so sweet. Very good caramel flavor. Cupcakes are good without frosting too. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These cupcakes were absolutely wonderful!! One of the most delicious cupcakes I have ever had. The only negative I can say is that the frosting wasn't really stiff enough to frost with, so I just turned it into a glaze & dipped the cupcakes in it. Still came out awesome & will definitely make again. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#AWESOME...but the icing was extremely sweet.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#delicious!!! I used cream cheese frosting because it is a family favorite. GREAT CUPCAKES!!!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#My whole family enjoyed this recipe they are great with and without the frosting.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I love how versatile zucchini is!! These cupcakes are so moist and a great way to use up all those zucchini you have growing in the garden. Kids will love them too and a great way for picky eaters to more veggies. Karen Wise, Volunteer Field Editor
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Wonderful recipe to use up zucchini. These moist cupcakes can be made by themselves like muffins but the icing is absolutely divine! Always well received whenever I make them. Have used the icing recipe on apple and pumpkin cake.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#So very good! They are much like a muffin until you put that HEAVENLY icing on them. WOW!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Such a good recipe! Love the spice flavors in it. I used ground allspice in place of the cloves and it is delicious! The caramel icing finishes it off perfectly!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Just made this on the request of my son-in-law after I posted them on Facebook. They are very good. I used allspice instead of cloves because I didn't have cloves and they were rather pricey in the store. I also made 12 cupcakes and put the rest in a loaf pan because I only had one cupcake tin. The loaf was good, too, though a little small. I will definitely be making these as an alternative to cupcakes. Would be good for breakfast or a midday snack if you left the frosting off. The frosting was also very good and easy to make. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#only made the muffins, without the icing as I don't like caramel... but nice and light and moist. A good recipe to exchange the zucchini for carrots, but my zucchini was ripe, the carrots aren't yet. Next time! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I HAVE MADE THIS RECIPE MANY TIMES, IT IS DELICIOUS! VERY MOIST & ICING IS WONDERFUL, ADDS SO MUCH FLAVOR TO THE VERY MOISE CUPCAKE. I ALWAYS HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF ZUCCHINI.YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS RECIPE. THANK-YOU
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#The frosting is heavenly!!! Great way to sneak veggies into the kids.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I made these gluten free and sugar free, still very good!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#This was a great hit as treats my son's birthday party 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#This was a great hit as treats my son's birthday party! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Absolutely delicious!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I seriously think these are THE BEST things that I have ever eaten! The cupcakes were so moist and yummy and the frosting... OH WOW!! Delicious :) If you leave them unfrosted, they are more like a muffin and are still very good. But really, though, you want the frosting!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Made this tonight! GREAT flavors, they blended so well! Thanks so much! These are so moist and delicious!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#This cupcake is so moist and delicious....I had to play with the frosting a bit to get it to the right consistency but the flavor is out of this world..
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#This is a great way to use zucchini from the garden. The last time I made them I substituted 1/4 c. of the oil with Lemon Olive Oil and added the zest of one lemon. Plus added about 1/2 c. soft cream cheese to the frosting. They disappeared. Yum!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These are probably the best cupcakes I have ever tasted! I have made them a lot over the last couple of years and always get rave reviews. The last time I made them, I did not have any orange juice but I did have apple juice so I used that instead. They were actually better which I did not think was possible. The apple juice changed the texture and they were much more moist and smooth. I dip the top of the cupcakes in the frosting when it is still warm and it makes a nice smooth finish as I do not like as much frosting as it shows in the picture. I also make these gluten free for my daughter and substitute gluten free flour and I can't tell the difference. I freeze these for her and they are wonderful even months later out of the freezer. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#amazingly yummy!! the frosting was so good and the cupcakes were super moist. the family LOVED them:) def make again
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Loved the frosting! Cupcakes were a little dry and I only baked them 20 min. Would try 15 next time.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#So easy & so moist!! Everybody loved them!!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I love this recipe - great use for all the zucchini in the garden! I am lucky to live in an area with an Olive Festival, so I have Meyer Lemon Olive Oil. Substituted 1/4 c. of that for part of the Canola Oil and added the zest of a lemon. Super fragrant and a great added touch!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#The caramel frosting is absolutely outstanding. The cupcakes themselves, however, were just okay, and really tasted more like a muffin than a cupcake. I have a chocolate cake with caramel frosting recipe that is really good, and I'd make that in cupcake liners before I'd ever make this again. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Moist & Delicious!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Great Cupcakes! 5 Stars!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Huge hit! Everyone loved mine - which I did modify a bit. I didn't have OJ so used lemonade. I figured it was citrusy and would add the needed tang. But I didn't think that cloves would work well with the lemon so I skipped that and, for the same reason, used vanilla extract instead of almond. These were light and airy, a good cake texture. The icing was fabulous, a new family favorite. Let your caramel mixture cool. Since I didn't have the time to wait, I cooled it in a ice bath. Wonderful recipe. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Made this for a party we were having & everyone loved them! I changed them a little to make them gluten & dairy free by using dairy free margarine instead of butter & sorghum flour & xanthum gum instead of all-purpose flour. They turned out great & no one could tell that they were gluten free!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Very good. These were moist and not too sweet or too veggie. Delicious!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Very tasty, Since I have an abundance of zucchini , it was a perfect use for some.....Frosting was great also.. A keeper for sure.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#very good but the frosting was a little tricky. kinda came out a little runny but not bad
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Really delicious, probably the best cupcakes I've ever made. The frosting is perfect and a great recipe alone. It's a wonderful blend of a branny taste with a sweet one. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These cupcakes are the best! My kids loved them which was the best part! But when I did the frosting it started to melt.....nest time Ill add more cofectioners suger!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I made these cupcakes on a whim for a pot-luck picnic. They were delicious and I had many requests for this recipe.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These were delicious. Granted, my frosting looked nothing like the picture (not as fluffy), but the taste of both the cupcakes and the frosting was outstanding. This won rave reviews with my family, the neighbor kids, and my coworkers (I made a dozen cupcakes for home and then used the rest of the batter to make a small cake that I took to work). Everyone loved the frosting and I had a bunch left over, so I used it on some gluten-free apple muffins I'd made for my daughter (since she couldn't eat these). Would definitely make these again and am going to experiment with a GF version and with using more zucchini.My husband tried to get me to agree that he could have as many as he wanted since they contain veggies! Hahah. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Do these come out moist if made in 9 x 13 pan instead of cupcakes?
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#They were amazing!! I used zucchini fresh from the farmers market. My kids loved them and we shared them with the grandparents!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I was a little dissapointed. Cupcakes turned out on the dry side. Perhaps the bake time should be reduced. Will not make again. I will stick to my no fail zucchini bread.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Amazing! Frosting was very sweet, I added the entire 2 C of powdered sugar and I wish I would have added a little less. But these were fantastic!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Very tasty!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#The recipe made 24 so I shared them with my parents and some of their neighbors at a senior complex. Everyone loved them, frosted or unfrosted! Great zucchini recipe!!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#AWESOME! Smells delicious and tastes even better.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I received free over grown yellow squash, so I substituted them for the zucchini. It was delicious.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I forgot to add for the frosting: After the milk/brown sugar cooks, remove from heat and add the vanilla. Cool.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I like this recipe, but would substitute vanilla for the almond extract, as I think it would overpower the more earthy cinnamon and cloves. Also, I would suggest adding chopped nuts to the batter--walnuts or pecans--maybe a 1/2 cup, depending on your preference.Also, for the frosting, I think you would run into problems adding the melted butter, brown sugar and milk with the confectioners sugar (as a preference, I would subsitute skim milk for the 2%). I would do the icing a bit differently. Warm the milk and brown sugar on the stove until the sugar dissolves. Soften butter slightly in the microwave, then place in a stand mixer and mix until smooth. Add confectioners sugar and mix. Add cooled brown sugar/milk mixture to the above and mix until the frosting is combined. Add additional confectioners sugar to achieve a spreadable consistency for frosting.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These cupcakes were amazing and we all loved the caramel frosting too! This will be my'go to' recipe for zucchini from now on. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I used applesauce rather than oil. Next time I make them I will use half oil/half applesauce to remedy their dryness at the edges. They stuck to the baking papers.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#RAVE reviews from everyone!!! Do NOT skip the frosting,.. that makes it! And the bonus is that now I can make my own caramel (without the high fructose corn sryup that all store bought has)! Excellent, I changed things a bit - a bit more spices, less salt, 2.5 cups of zucchini and I also replace some of the wheat flour with oat flour for a more healty benefit,.. result, it was more moist with extra cup of zucchini and also healthier. Incredible!!! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Delicious! I put chopped walnuts on top of the frosting.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#great recipe, made these for party,there were none left
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#One word: Phenomenal!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#The better one that I eat!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These were fabulous! The icing is so tasty, but very sweet. I did have to add extra powdered sugar to get the right consistency. The next time that I make these I am going to try adding cream cheese to the frosting. I think the cupcakes were better the second day as the favors had time to meld.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Wow! I made the recipe as directed. (I did put the icing saucepan in a bowl of ice water when I was beating the icing so it chilled faster.)The cupcake is very delicately spiced, and the caramel icing is sooo yummy! Fortunately I prepared them to share with friends - otherwise I think my family would have wiped out the whole batch on their own!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Great alternative cupcake. Family thought they tasted like pumpkin pie in a cupcake wrapper.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#i made these today my husband and son said these are execelent they we easy to make i added about 1\2 cup more zucchini cooked only for about 12 min the frosting is really good but hard time getting it the consistancy i wanted but u should try them they're greatttttt u wont be disappointed 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Mouth watering! Everyone I made these for loves them!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These cupcakes were so good! My family loved them. I made them in the morning, and they were a nice snack for breakfast. I would definitely make these a lot!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Great way to use zuchinni from my garden!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I made these for the women I worked with and they love them even the younger girls loved them they could notbelieve the cupcakes had good for you Zucchini in them! One lady said she didn't like Zucchini but she loved the cupcakes, and wanted the recipe! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Turned out great! The frosting turned out more like an icing for me, either way it was delicious, had a maple taste to it.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#After an abundant supply of zucchini I made these cupcakes several times this summer. Some went to work and many stayed home. I got rave reviews for these and even several requests for the recipe. As a TOH field editor I would highly recommend this recipe. It is an exceptionally easy recipe to make, the cupcakes were delicious and the icing was good also. If you wish to speed the icing process up a bit you can place the cooked part in ice and use an electric mixer. This way you can get to the finished product sooner. I froze several packets of zucchini premeasured just to make these in the winter. Try these you won't be dissapointed. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#This recipe is awesome!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#With the frosting it is definitely a dessert. Without it, you could call it dessert or a muffin, depending upon your individual taste. Although I love chocolate chips in zucchini cake/bread as much as the next person, it really is refreshing to have this one sweetened by the caramel icing. It's an original and a flavor combination that works for me. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I just love these about as much or more than pear muffins.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Everyone that I shared the muffins with loved them! The recipe is now in my recipe box!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I made mini cupcakes for my husband to take to work; half frosted the other half plain. I ate one of each and they were moist and delectable. My husband thought I was crazy and said no one is going to eat zucchini cupcakes. They were gone by the end of the day and two weeks later, he came home with a special request to send in more!!! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Very good but the icing makes this cupcake complete.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I made this recipe recently. For the cupcake I followed the recipe exactly 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#This is a very easy recipe to make. The texture of the cupcakes are firm, almost like a sponge cake. They have just the right amount of flavor. I could not pick up on the orange juice flavor in the cupcakes. I followed this recipe exactly, however if you are not a fan of cloves you could easily leave them out and not ruin the flavor. I would suggest if using frozen zucchini to let it thaw in a strainer first.The caramel frosting was very easy to prepare and flavorful. I used a bag to pipe it on. I also helped cool it down by continuously beating with my mixer in a bowl of ice, this way I could add the powdered sugar faster and the frosting became a nice texture quicker. Very good, made a double batch the first time, would definitely make again.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These were heavenly but next time I am doubling the caramel sauce and saving half to drizzle over the frosting it was sooo good!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I absolutely loved these you would never guess they have zucchini in them very good, even the icing is delicious
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I like trying new things and my Mother was talking about making zucchini bread which I don't believe I have ever eaten, but for some reason sounded good. I came across this recipe. I LOVE carmel so the idea of a carmel frosting on top sealed the deal. I just completed baking and frosting my cupcakes. They are pretty good. Like a spice cake as one review said. They weren't as moist as I had imagined from the reviews. I think I will make them bigger next time. I don't believe I made them big enough for the moistness. The carmel frosting is DEFINITELY worth the time and effort it takes to make it. I know I will use it on cakes and other things. It is DELICIOUS! I put the left over frosting in the fridge to put on brownies or something later. Or just eat like carmel. Thank you for the healthy alternative to normal cupcakes. We will see what my coworkers think of it tomorrow when I take it to work. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Absolutely fantastic like everyone said. I expected nothing less. I too, like others, cut down the sugar and they were still fantastic. Could probably cut even more as icing makes up the sweetness. These tasted fantastic even without icing.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I made these cupcakes with my granddaughter and they were delicious. She carefully spooned the flour into the measuring cups without packing...and mixed together dry ingredients just until flour was blended. Her cupcakes were soooo tender.Quite by mistake we ended up making'maple bar icing' instead of frosting by adding two sticks butter, instead of one, and some additional confectioner sugar so icing could be swirled around on top of cupcakes. My oh my, was it ever delicious!!! Will try the frosting recipe next time, but will be keeping the'Maple bar icing' for this cupcake as well. Excellent treat for all ages. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#OUTSTANDING!!!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These are amazing! No one is ever going to know that I am using up my zucchini this way!! They are so moist and yummy!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Very good. Frosting was very sweet, but that can EASILY be solved by not putting as much on. How could you complain?! Nice spice. I can imagine how they would make good gluten free too!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These were great, not oily like most zucchini recipes. For my cooking class, we used a giant zucchini, and scooped out the seeds. We also cut the amount of cloves to 1/4 teaspoon and doubled the recipe which yielded 45 delicious cupcakes. Don't skip the frosting -- it was almost like fudge --yum!! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#This was a great recipe - very tasty cupcake - a bit like a spice cake and the frosting went so well with it. Caution, the frosting is very sweet, but it frosting!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These are delicious! My frosting did not come out fluffy as shown, but then my mixer broke before I was done. Very moist. Cake and frosting are a great compliment to each other.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These cupcakes are moist and have a great deal of flavor. I also sometimes substitute cream cheese frosting for the caramel frosting. Still is a big hit for any event.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#So good...
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Wow! These cupcakes are great; the icing certainly sets these cupcakes apart from the many other recipes available. We made some to share with neighbors and they also enjoyed them much.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These are so good. It's such a nice alternative to zucchini bread and my kids love them!!! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I used rice flour instead to make gluten free and everyone loved them!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I brought these to work and they were a hit! Many of my coworkers were suprised that they were zucchini cupcakes. A couple of people thought that the frosting was a little too sweet so next time I will try the suggestions listed here. Wonderful recipe!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I found that 2/3rd full was a little to much, next time I'll use less. Tastes like spice cake, very moist and everyone loved them. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Just made these cupcakes! What a great recipe! So moist and a great way to use up that zucchini!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I am a vegan so don't use eggs, butter or dairy milk when cooking. I substituted 3 Tbls of water + 1 Tbls of ground flaxeed for each egg used. Like other reviewers, I also substituted applesauce for the oil. and reduced the cloves to 1/4 tsp. As for the frosting, I skipped the one presented here - although I could have used vegan butter substitute, soy milk and vegan cream cheese - and instead made a streusel topping using 1/4 C flour, 3 Tbls brown sugar, 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground allspice (or you could also use pumpkin pie spice), 1 Tbls canola oil and 1 C coarsely chopped pecans, all mixed together and sprinkled on top of cupcakes before they went into the oven. Yum! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I've been making these since the original recipe came out in TOH. My kids grew up eating these almost every summer, and sometimes with frozen zucchini in the winter. A truly awesome way to use zucchini and enjoy a delicious treat, as well. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I LOVE THESE CUPCAKES!!!!!!!! I have amde these many time & each time I get only good compiments & everyone askes for the recipe =D I also entered them in our local fair this year & got 1st Juges fav. best of class & best of show!!! My mom craves these cpucakes all the time ;) Highly recomend them!!!!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I have made this recipe again and again. I really think it's the frosting! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I made this recipe using sugar substitute (good hints on the Splenda site on how to bake with it) and added a half cup of ground flax for some added omegas. Moist, tasty and even without the decadent frosting, simply delicious. A real keeper. Thanks for this one.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I followed the recipe to a tee . These cupcakes were delicious. Texture was perfect. Icing is wonderful. Definitely a keeper! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I did not use the cloves and the recipe was fantastic without them!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Excellent recipe, the cupcakes went to my husbands work and they fought over them! Very moist and full of flavor! Thank you
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I have been subscribing to Taste of Home since 1994, which is around the time that this recipe appeared as a contest winner. I have made it many times and it is fantastic! Some of the best cupcakes I have ever eaten.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I made 2 batches of these for my husband to take to work. They were a huge hit. I kept some home with no icing on them because I can't have dairy, and they were really good with no icing too! If I were to change anything, I might use a touch less cloves. I think people that don't like the intensity of cloves won't like these much, so try them with less and you might find another way to use all those zucchini! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#sounded good, but, sorry didn't care for it 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Made these and boy did they get raves! The caramel frosting was fabulous as well.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These were very good. Loved the spices and icing made it so good.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#OMG! Made for a bar-b-que.... ALL I HAVETO SAY IS EVERYONE WAS ASKING 4 THE RECIPE. THEY LASTED A WHOLE HR ON TABLE... FRIENDS WANTED MORE LOL I MADE 3 BATCHES FOR 30 PEOPLE ..
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I'm not a big zucchini fan but I loved these. My fiance and his kids really like zucchini so I thought I'd try it. I was really impressed and the caramel icing was very good. I definitely will make these again. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#such a good recipe.! really like the cake and the frosting!~
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These cupcakes are delicious! Definitely a new family favorite.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I made this recipe today and it was great! Everyone loved it, and it smells wonderful baking! The caramel icing just made it that much better!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#We love these! Anyone I've made them for has asked me for the recipe. The frosting is to die for. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I love these! I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla instead in the actually batter they still turned out delicious! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Very delicious and moist!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#May I add...I scooped out all the zucchini seeds prior to shredding the zucs. Also, I put the shredded zuc in a colander for a while and pressed some of the excess juice out. I had maybe a tablespoon of liquid drain off the zucs. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I've been making these cupcakes for years from the original recipe printed in a ToH magazine from the'90s. They are outstanding! The cupcakes are moist and spicy. The frosting is wonderful! I do end up with more frosting than I need though. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Very good recipe! The frosting is a little time consuming. Next time I will just use a quick cream cheese frosting to cut back on time a little.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I have been making these for years. They are my daughters favorite. She especially loves the icing. They are so moist. Most of the time people wrinkle their nose when I tell them what are they then they are asking for the recipe as soon as they taste of them.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#The cupcakes were moist & were liked by the crew of volunteers at the food pantry. I did not like the frosting, much too sweet, so instead frosted them with cream cheese frosting.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#WOW, this is a great recipe, I did add nuts and raisins. I will make this again and again.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Made the cupcakes for friends and it was a big hit. Great way to use up the extra zucchini in the garden. The almond extract makes it unique. It is also delicious with Philadelphia Cream Cheese frosting, although the maple is very good and easy to make. Cream Cheese gives it a different but excellent flavor also.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#This was a nice treat! The frosting is very sweet, but my family loved it. I think they tasted much better the second day as the flavors seemed to blend more, and the intensity of the frosting seemed to mellow a bit.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Were easy to make, tasted great...quite moist. Did add some cream cheese to the original frosting.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Absolutely loved these cupcakes. Loved the carmel frosting on the spicy cake.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Not sure what everyone was so impressed with. I made these and they were really dry. Maybe I just didn't add enough Zucchini but still I had to smother my cupcake in creamcheese frosting to eat it. To be fair I did not try the caramel frosting. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Very good cupcakes! Great spice flavor in the cupcake combines really well with the caramel frosting! My husband said it's THE best cupcake he's ever had! I made them exactly as written. It made exactly 24 perfect size cupcakes. Will definitely keep this recipe handy to use often!! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I've already made these 3 times. Took them to a family get together and they were a hit!! Really good and moist. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I tried these cupcakes and gave them away. Everyone just loved them. I had to try one for myself since I was getting such great reviews. They are great. I most definitly will make them again. But keep more than one for myself.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Mine were a bit dry, even though I didn't drain my zucchini. Good flavor, great frosting. Leave the frosting get to room temp before adding confectioner's sugar and you won't have any problems with the consistency. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#i made these for a sale at work they loved them rondha sullivan
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#This recipe was easy to make and delicious!!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These were wonderful muffins. The frosting was the icing on the cake! Great recipe!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These were gone in a flash. We did opt for a cream cheese frosting. A nice light texture, not too sweet, but YUMMY!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These were so delicious, espcially the frosting! People just raved about how delicious they were! I would definitely make it again.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Great Cupcake! These cupcakes were super moist and delicious. The icing was a bit sweet but the caramel flavor was excellent . I will definitely make these cupcakes again. Everyone LOVED them
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Yummy and semi-healthy! Even those who gave me a funny look when I told them what kind it was were happy they tried it. I am ready to make some more this weekend!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I made the cupcakes for a potluck and was more than pleased with the flavor. All those that tried them, loved them.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#They were delicious!! I'll definitely make them again... I didn't make the frosting though,, maybe next time,,but instead I put on my favorite which is Cream Cheese Frosting... 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Delish!. I had to use extra powdered sugar to get the frosting a little thicker, but it was a fantastic flavor! Will def.make again!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Easy to make. Frosting took a while because of letting it cool, but well worth the effort!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I made 24 mini muffins and 12 regular muffins with this recipe......delicious! I didn't peel or drain the zucchini and used half green and half yellow zucchini. Men especially loved the frosting. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I make these every summer and we all love them!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Great recipe. Very easy to make and everyone enjoyed them
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#OMG these are wonderful I made them yesterday and another batch today. The icing is really good and I also did some with a Cream Cheese icing. And they even taste just as good with no icing.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#My frosting did not turn out like the picture but the cupcakes were great. I love the OJ and extract in them!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Absolutely scrumptious! I am with the reviewer Sillygirl- I do not peel or seed my zucchini or squeeze out moisture. I used a smallish tender zucchini. The cupcakes turned out beautifully. I wasnt sure about the frosting either, although it turned out ok and tasted Outrageously fabulous- next time I will add cream cheese and more confectioners sugar to make the frosting more fluffy but still have that fabulous carmel taste! The flavors are the best! Great recipe find! Thanks- Loved it!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Came across this recipe about 10 years ago in Taste of Home - LOVE it. I even grate & freeze just the amount of zucchini I need & use it all through the year. YUMMY!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Very delicious, but for me I'd cut the cloves by half or leave them out and use applesauce instead of oil. My family enjoyed the smell of these as they were cooking just as much as when they got to eat them!!! Will definitly use the frosting on other breads, YUMMY! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Delicious! Love the frosting!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Sooooooo delicious!!! Can't wait to make them for my grandchildren and Agape Celebration at church. Great even without the frosting. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I have made these for years and my kids gobble them up! I never drain the zucchini and they always come out moist and perfect.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#followed another's advice and cut the sugar to 1 cup, replaced a little over half the oil with applesauce. Baked in bread loaf pans, one with walnut pieces, another with blueberries at 375 for 45 min. Cut the frosting recipe in half, and added more milk to make a glaze. Yummy! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Firstly, I never peel or seed my zucchini. My mom's recipe for the cupcakes are similar so i just used hers. I made the frosting and it was more like a glaze..should i cool it completely before adding conf. sugar? Instead of putting it in when it's lukewarm? It definately did not look like the picture. I then added a pack of cream cheese and more conf. sugar and it turned out fabulous!! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#When I make zucchini cupcakes I do not drain the Zucchini but throw in some whole bran till right consistency.Added fiber and health benefits, the kids love them.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#This is a very good recipe; thanks!*Yes, drain the zucchini.*
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These spicy cupcake are awesome!This will be made over and over!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These cupcakes are great! I reduced the sugar in the cakes to 1 cup, and they were still plenty sweet enough.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These are absolutely wonderful!!!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Question... Do you have to drain the zucchini to release the moisture?
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Made these cupcakes for our family gathering. They were a HUGE hit! Love, love, love them.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Between having a crazy amount of zucchini to use and it being a lovely cool day, my friend and I wound up at this webpage and we just gotta say -- DELICIOUS. The spice and caramel combination is just awesome.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Really good. I used apple juice instead of orange and cream cheese icing. Worth making again.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I have already written something about this recipe but I have to write again. Previously I used my mom's zucchini recipe and this frosting recipe. I decided to try this recipe just as it is written and they were incredible. I did not drain the zucchini either...and there was a lot of liquid too. This is how good they are...I first made them and accidentally added 1 third cup sugar instead of 1 and a third cup ( my bad handwriting). My 6 nephews and nieces ran in from outside and grabbed one even though I told them what I did. They were all gone in less then 5 minutes!!! I personally didn't care for them but they still raved about how good they were. I then made a second batch...to me it was much better:)) 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#This is our new favorite zucchini recipe. The frosting is just like my mother in law's Danish fudge. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I love feeding my grandkids healthy desserts. They truly devoured these. The first time I made them they were very dense. I set the grated zucchini in a colander to drain before I made them the next time and they were perfect.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#These are a favorite with my kids. They love them!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#My favorite of all my zucchini recipes!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#re: zucchini cupcakes---these are so moist and full of flavor--if you don't want to frost em just have them with cool whip!! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Best cupcakes I ever made. Great cake & great frosting. They compliment each other so well.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#GREAT cupcake the frosting was yummy!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I baked in a 9x13 pan for 31 min., substituted milk for OJ and omitted cloves. Great!  Use 1 1/2 c. powd. sugar for frosting, otherwise it's too stiff to spread   
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Very Yummy, and the frosting is Fabu!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#They are good, but even though there is zucchini in there, it's got too much sugar, fat, and white flour in them to be thinkin' the veggies in there will make them good for you . It is a good excuse to make cupcakes though, when you have alot of zucchini, lol. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I made these cupcakes due to the over abundant supply of zucchini we have in our garden and they were absolutely delicious! I brought them to work and EVERYONE raved about them. The carmel frosting really added that special touch. I would definitely make them again.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I like to make these cupcakes with only half of the frosting. They are pretty sweet with the whole amount. I have also served them without the frosting.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#This recipe yielded surprised comments from those friends who tried it to find it contained zucchini. Next time I make it I will add raisins and/or nuts and use a cream cheese frosting to take away some of the sweetness. Very good!!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#My 4 year old helped me make these so she could take a'treat' to daycare! They were a big hit!! They never knew that they were eating their vegetables! Great recipe! 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#With the abundance of zucchini in our garden it made sense to try this recipe and am I glad I did!!!!I took the cupcake to work and everyone RAVED about them!! The ones I left at home the kids ate up and wanted more! I did not frost my cupcakes and no one noticed!!I actually shred my zucchini and vacuum seal it in 1 cup bags then have it in my freezer when I want the taste of summer in the middle of the winter!Thanks for sharing the recipe it is awesome!
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Eveyone loved these especially the grandkids said tasted like reeses peanut butter cups.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Wow are these good! My husband who does not really like zucchini really loves these cupcakes.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I love the peel left on. If you pick them before any large seeds form and then shred them in the food processor, you will never be able to tell there are seeds or peels except for the pretty green flecks in the finished product. Besides, the peel has most of the nutrition.
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#it is whatever you prefer. my dh doesn't like the peeling so i always peel and seed it for my recipes. i like it myself and will eat it with the peel and the seeds. if you have picky eaters its best to go ahead and peel it. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#I'm not use to baking with zucchini so I have to ask, do you peel it before you shred it, or leave the peeling on? Thank you for your time. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Hi Wesley, I encountered a similar problem. Try cooling your sugar/butter mixture a bit more and that should help. IN fact I could cool it down to less than tepid: like a baby's bottle. 
Zucchini Cupcake#0#0#Substituted cucumber for zucchini-works well/substituted 2/3 c Splenda Blend for sugar/not a moist cupcake/frosting required 3+ c confectioners sugar for spreading consistency-anything less would create glaze consistency
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#1#My family fell in love with this and keep asking for it again. We give it 5 stars
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#These look great. What fat% ground beef do you recommend??
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I made this recipe exactly as written. I LOVE it! I will definitely be making this on a regular bases. I wonder how well it would freeze. Freeze before or after cooking? The sauce is very good, perfect glaze.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#It looks good! Can you tell us what is prepared mustard?
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#1#0#I liked the review of using jalapeno ketchup so I diced up a fresh jalalpeno and added it to the meat mixture. It was very good. I liked the cheese inside the meatloaf. Have never done that before.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#3#1#Used half regular ketchup, half jalapeno ketchup. So good! Made a double batch, baked them, cooled them, and then froze them solid on cookie sheets and vacuum sealed them.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#1#0#Mu husband loves meatloaf but I have NEVER liked it. I generally find them really dry no matter how much ketchup you drown it. I reluctantly tried these and I love them. Very easy to make, moist and full of flavor. Great as left overs also. I do use a meat mix of 1/3 lb each of ground beef, veal and pork. I also add some hot sauce to the ketchup-sugar topping for a little more kick and to balance the sweetness. This is a repeat recipe.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#5#0#I love this recipe. I make it all the time. I halve the sugar in the sauce as a preference and it comes out perfectly, still sweet and just perfect for our family. It is one of my family's trusted favorites. Thank you for the recipe! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#1#0#Very tasty! We loved the sauce. This is a little different than my usual meatloaf recipe, and I think my family actually liked this one better!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#1#0#These were easy to make and delicious! Mine weren't as neat looking as the picture and I should've diced the onions smaller. The flavor of the sauce is excellent. I will definitely make these again.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#grandkids loved these, and opa for a sandwich for work
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#1#0#These were delicious. Cut back on milk and brown sugar as I don't like them too sweet. They can also be frozen. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Since I tried this recipe it is my go-to meatloaf. Everyone enjoyed.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Excellent recipe. I add my own seasonings to the meat to add even more flavor. Try it, you won't be disappointed. Thanks for the recipe! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Made this with my daughter, used a little less milk as I read in the reviews, came out amazing. Will be making this again
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#1#Very yummy! My mom always made these growing up. The only problem I have with the recipe, is there's too much milk and makes the mixture too soupy. I put 1/3 cup or less and it comes out much better texture. The original recipe form Taste of home cookbook, calls for 1 (5 ounce) can of evaporated milk. I need to try that!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#My family loved this recipe! Yummy!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Very easy and very tasty! This will definitely be a go-to dinner for me! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#1#2#I make two changes. First I enshroud the peas in a ball of mashed potatoes, the kids get a kick out of discovering the peas and not having to chase them all over there plates. I also brown the potatoes in the oven. Second, instead of the ketchup topping I make a good brown gravy, that covers the meat loaf and potatoes. Yum, Yum.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#My boyfriend absolutely loved these!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I made this as two loaves. My only changes were to use onion powder and I cut the topping in half. I have made it a few times and the kids really like it.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#These are hands down the best meatloaf/meatballs recipe I have ever tried. It's a win every single time.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#2#1#This is the same recipe my 93 year old mother made and it has ALWAYS been a hit with everyone who is lucky enough to have a slice! The only thing we did not include is the cheese, however I just recently made it exactly as the recipe states and the cheese is a wonderful, rich addition! Love this recipe, it's definitely a keeper! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I have been making these for years. Very tasty and cook quickly. Leftovers reheat nicely.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#These are my go-to weeknight meatloaf recipe. They bake faster because they are single loaves and the cheesy flavor is great. Left overs can be frozen for future meals.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#omg its looking so tasty
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#1#0#These are the best meat loaf (ves) we have ever tried! My entire family loves them! Just delicious!!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Best ever!!! I add bell peppers to it and usually double or triple it so I can freeze some for another meal. I have taken it to family reunions as meatballs and everyone wanted the recipe!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I don't make any other type of meatloaf except these li'l cheddar mini meatloaves! My entire family, Mom, sisters, moth-in-law all love this recipe. Always a hit! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#1#0#I cannot see the recipe because of the advertisement covering it. I only see the partial ingredients. Egglands Best takes up a huge square over the ingredients!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#3#A good beef dish should be juicy and full of aroma https://web.facebook.com/cookingplushomedecor/?modal=admin_todo_tour
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Loved by everyone! I doubled the recipe but did not double the cheese or the brown sugar. The sauce was plenty sweet and could maybe even do with less sugar. My husband said this was his favorite meatloaf recipe.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This is my favorite meatloaf recipe ever! I've been making these super tasty meatloaves since 1999. I make 6 loaves instead of 8 and cook for 40-45 minutes. I also cover the pan with foil for the first 20 minutes. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#It took more cooking time then the recipe stated , at least 45 to 50 minutes. And I used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of oats. And the recipe was amazing!!!! I will definitely be making this again!!!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#1#What a great recipe for family fare! Been meaning to try these for some time and today amidst everyone's mid-December running-around I discovered some plans had changed and I needed to provide a last minute supper whilst still running errands. I found I had all the ingredients and they came together and cooked speedily. I made exactly to recipe and they tasted great! This must rank as a TOH classic. Thanks for sharing and for keeping available for decades for us to enjoy.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This is my go to recipe any time I make meatloaf. My family loves it!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I have been making this recipe for years - from an early addition of Taste of Home.My husband is very picky and this is by far his favorite meatloaf recipe.I have also made it as large meatloaves and taken it to church potlucks. Never any left.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Great recipe.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#So good and easy to make. I have made them several times because I can use gluten free oatmeal . We have 3 celiacs in the family. I doubled the recipe but made a single recipe of the sauce. I like the flavor of the meatloaf to shine through.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Made as one whole meatloaf, after all meatloaf is supposed to be easy! Loved the sauce. Very good. Also, made with leftover rice next time, because I needed to use it. Worked out fine!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Just made these for dinner, made them exactly as the recipe states. I was really disappointed with them after reading all the great reviews. They were bland and the amount of ingredients didn't seem proportional to one pound of beef. Out of 3 adults none of us liked it, I threw out the leftovers. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Hasn't anyone noticed the bake time is different from the Total Time comment to the Directions. It is 45 minutes. Love these. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#These little gems are so tasty! I keep a few without sauce because one of my kids prefers them that way. I used ground bison and they are simply delicious! I'm a Volunteer Field Editor and I love trying and reviewing recipes. This one does not disappoint!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#These are wonderful. My husband agrees. They will now be our go to meat loaf recipe. Just delicious. I wouldn't change a thing. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This was excellent! The loaves were so tender and the cheese, oats and glaze gave them incredible flavor. This may just be my new go-to meat loaf recipe. If you don't want to make individual loaves, you can probably make one large loaf and adjust the cooking time. I will definitely make these little loaves again and again!Volunteer Field Editor 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#My aunt brought these fantastic meat loaves to a family reunion about 15 years ago. I have been making them ever since and my family absolutely LOVES them!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#love this even my picky eater husband loved it
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#1#0#I have been making this meatloaf since I first saw it in the April/May issue back in 1999! I still have the original recipe that I cut out and have now laminated! That is how amazing this recipe is! When I first met my husband 20 years ago he hated meatloaf. I tried many recipes and he literally hated them all, until I made this one. I have never made any other meatloaf since we first made this recipe. It is super easy to make and it turns out perfectly delicious every single time. The sauce is absolutely amazing! I have never changed a thing and everyone who tries it loves it. Now that we are in our 40's we are trying to watch what we eat. So I decided to substitute ground turkey for the ground beef and I kept everything else the same... PERFECT! It was even more moist than normal. Beef or turkey, this recipe is absolute perfection! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I made a few loaves without ketchup for my picky little eaters... we loved it! Thanks for the recipe TOH!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#These little meat loaves are wonderful. My wife really loves them!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This is a very delicious way to make meat loaf. I do not make them individually though, I make one large meat loaf. Sometimes I use mozzarella cheese also.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Pretty good. I didnt add any brown sugar or onions because I didn't have any. And i had to use bread crumbs instead of oats but it was still great!! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#My husband especially enjoys these moist tasty meat loaves. I often make these and freeze them when they cool.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#These are the best! Just had them last night for dinner. The only change (because of preference) is using a small can of tomato paste instead of ketchup. Started making these in 2000 when they were in the annual TOH book. My son would say if he was ever on death row and had to choose his last meal, it would be these. I promised him I would make them whenever he wanted so he wouldn't have to commit a crime to have them for dinner! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Love this meatloaf recipe. Been making it for years now. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#We have been making cheddar loaves twice a month since the recipe first appeared in 1999. I like to add dry minced onion to the topping and a little Worcestershire, sometimes I make the loaves around a cube of sharp cheddar instead of grated because some of the grated cheese cooks out.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#No question about it, this is a great meatloaf recipe! Made according to directions. The mini idea made these cute and easy serving. In our opinion you could make half the sauce and still be delicious! As a volunteer field editor with Taste of Home I love preparing classic dishes with a new twist.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#These little meatloaves are tender and tasty. The sauce is sweet, which my kids love. I do wish I could have tasted the cheddar because I love cheese.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#My daughter said that this was her favorite meatloaf recipe. Sauce tasted great, and I love that this bakes much faster than a whole meatloaf.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Easy and delish. The kids loved them too!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This is a wonderful recipe. I also added some horseradish for a little zing
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Quickly became a family favorite. I have two tips: One, replace half of the ketchup in the sauce with your favorite bbq sauce. And two, double the recipe because there will be no leftovers!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This smells fantastic when it is in the oven, and it tastes as good as it smells.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#A family favorite...made at least once a month!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#A friend brought these over after i had my first baby. Very good
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Making this again tonight because it is a favorite at our house. The flavor and consistency are great when hot and even better the next day on a sandwich. I make my mini loaves bigger than suggested - 4 loaves instead of 8. One pound of meat only serves 4 here.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#My family loved it! Very easy to make.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#absolutely love this!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#My family loves this meal. Espically if you add bacon yum!!!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#OMG, this is awesome!! We went gluten-free (for medical reasons) about two years ago, and I have been looking for a good meatloaf recipe ever since!! I made this with gluten-free quick oats and it was perfect. We both LOVED this!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Fabulous!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Just made it tonight. Excellent!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#What a great recipe. I love the presentation. And it helps with portion control. We freeze them and pull them out whenever we want meatloaf. Instead of trying to shape my own loaves, i use a 8 loaf mini-loaf pan. Works great. It does make a lot of sauce however. Could probably cut the sauce in 1/2.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Quick, easy and flavorful.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#could you tell me if these can be baked in a cupcake pan or mini loaf pan and if so what temp and how long?Thanks so much!!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Love this recipe. Gave it to my daughter and she was happy with it also.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This has been one of my family favorites since the first time I made it! I have made it in loaves as well as in muffin tins.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I too make Mini meatloaves. But I use a small corn bread loaf pan to form them. Spray the m ini pan an d pack with the meatloaf mixture, shake out into the Baking pan. Continue withe the balance of the mixture
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I have added a couple extra ingredients to the recipe and won 2nd place in a meatlaof contest at my local grocery store. amazingly awesome!!!!!!!!!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Was devoured in seconds.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#1#First, you have to like meatloaf.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I thought it was very good, just a little too sweet. So I'm making it again and cutting down on the brown sugar. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#wow, this recipe was much more than I thought it would be. this is the one to try people. Outstanding!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This mini meatloaf recipe is a staple in my household!! Very delicious!!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#so easy to make and taste delicious as well they wont disappoint...
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#We LOVE them!! I found this recipe in a magazine about 15 years ago and have been cooking it for my family ever since. I always double the sauce, and serving them with mashed potatoes is a MUST!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#we loved these!! I usually make cheeseburger meatloaf and decided to switch it up with these...GREAT idea!! They are so easy to make and the sauce is amazing !! Definitely a keeper!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#When I made this recipe for a family gathering I overheard These are very, very, very good meatloaves! . Everyone raved about them. The addition of milk, oats, and cheese really extends the meat, so I ended up with lots of leftovers. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I never cared for meatloaf but I love these! They are very moist. We usually double all the ingredients except for the sauce and it is perfect!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Yum! Loved these!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#These are the best meat loaves, usually I am not a fan.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#My husband and I loved this recipe, it was great. Will try it with a little bit less of the sauce. Will definitely make these again.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#this is the ONLY meatloaf recipe I use.Since 1999 it is still the best.Make it into one meatloaf or 4 minisadd Worcestershire & Siracha to the sauceall I can say is YUMMY
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Needed a little more seasoning. Added some garlic. Yum
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Best meatloaf ever!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Very Good
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Very good.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#These truly are amazing! We added some Jacks seasoning and a little cayenne to the mixture and when done baking put under the broiler for about 5 minutes. Delicious!!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I have been making this recipe for years & it is our favorite meatloaf recipe . So moist & delicious!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Have been making this recipe for years! When I was single, I loved being able to make the individual loaves, eating what I could and then freezing the other loaves to eat later. Now I make it for my family all the time. A definite winner!!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This is the main meatloaf that I make. I have made changes, though--I'll top it with barbecue sauce and I also sometimes cook it in my slow cooker (high for about 3 hours). It is absolutely wonderful! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This is very tasty. My meatloaf is similar to this, except without the cheese, so it wasn't a stretch to think my family would like this. Especially my 3 year old. It's a winner! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This was very tasty. My meatloaf recipe is very similar to this, except without the added cheese, so it wasn't a stretch to think my family would like this recipe. Especially my 3 year old. It's a winner! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This was very tasty. The meatloaf I usually make is very similar to this, except without the cheese, so it wasn't a stretch to think my family would like this recipe. Especially my 3 year old, of course. This is definitely a winner! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I have froze these before. They thaw in microwave or gravy on stove top or in oven.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#These moist flavorful meatloaves are a favorite for my family who usually do not prefer meatloaf! I also add a few other herbs and spices such as garlic powder, basil, and thyme. This is a favorite at my house!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This is nice and wonderful. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#So good! I used plain breadcrumbs and had no problem with the consistency. My husband loved it and our 3 year old chowed down as well. Served with mashed potatoes for tasty comfort dinner.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I'm not a great cook-tell me about freezing either cooked or uncooked. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I love this recipe so much that I'm not sure if I'll ever go back to my family's traditional meatloaf recipe! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I always disliked meatloaf but my husband loved it. My mother made this for him and I loved it. Make it all the time. Great for company.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I have never been a meatloaf lover, but this recipe changed my mind. Whole family enjoyed. Well make again!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Everyone loved this - I put them in a muffin tin for individualized portions. Easy to freeze.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I made this using venison, and they were absolutely delicious! Great recipe!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I didn't have enough ketchup to make the sauce so I used half ketchup and have cocktail sauce. Made it really zippy! I have made it exactly as is and it's GREAT, but the cocktail sauce flavor is really tasty too! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Three out of four kids liking this recipe is a success in my book! I used minced onion because it is what I had on hand. Very easy and quick to make.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Always keep a stock in my freezer. Quick to make. Add cilantro and try different cheeses. It is unbelievable! Thanks!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#These are soooo good! Make them now!~ Theresa
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I made these today for the first time....but it won't be the last for sure. When my husband tasted these, he exclaimed.. this recipe is a keeper ! We loved the sweet and tangy sauce. Thanks for sharing this recipe with the world. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#These are so easy & good. I have made these many, many times.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I've made these more times than I can count for my family & for company. Everyone loves them. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#So good & easy! I love these & my family does too :)
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I have used this recipe for years! It is the best meatloaf ever!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I've made this recipe several times....always great. I use 1/2 the sugar to suit our tastes and have also used ground turkey. Just as yummy. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Wow, very tasty, fast and easly. I added little bit more onion. I served with rice (spooned the Meat Loaves` juice over the rice) and steamed vegetables! Soo Gooood!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#So much flavor!!! I love this recipe! Definitely one of my favorites!!!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I make this for guests A LOT! Every single time I am asked for the recipe. It's easy and everyone loves it. To make one big meatloaf, I double and cook for 1 1/2 hrs. I add the sauce in last half hour. Meatloaf is something not everyone will like-this recipe is the exception. Love it! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Entire family loved them.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I loved this recipe because it was fast and easy. Tasted amazing! This is a great meal to make if you have a busy schedule. My husband loved it, and wants me to make it again very soon!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I have made this many times and they make a great meal to take to others.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This is the only meat loaf my family will eat. It's Yumalicious! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#My husband and I loved this recipe. I will definitely make again. Great leftovers!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This is the best meatloaf recipe I've ever tried! It's moist and flavorful, and the topping is just the best! I've taught my boyfriend how to make them and we have them with creamy potato sticks (you can find that recipe on this website also). It's just one of our favorite meals we have often. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Made this many times! Super easy and very yummy. There is always too much sauce though, I cut it in half :)
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This is the best meat loaf recipe EVER! Whenever I ask my husband what he wants for dinner, he always asks for these meatloaves.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#made these for 2nd time today, this time used a grill pan so the excess fat drains off - worked great. i prefer to saute the onion before adding to mixture, not a fan of crunchy onion in meatloaf. i ran out of ketchup today so used tomato sauce instead - tasted just as good.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I used extra lean ground beef and it was rather greasy. We didn't taste any cheddar cheese in the meat loaf, so I'm thinking the melting cheese added to the grease in the pan. We liked the ketchup mixture, but will cut back on the brown sugar next time since it was a little too sweet for our taste. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#You'll never want another kind of meatloaf again! And it's easy to make. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#VERY GOOD! My husband and I arent huge fans of meat loaf but have eaten it once or twice and really liked it. We made this to give it a try and loved it! The sauce is sweet and so yummy. We didnt change the ingredients but changed the way we cooked it. We put in all as one loaf into a loaf pan and baked it twice as long.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I have made this a few times and we all love it. This time I was out of cheddar so I used velveeta cheese. It was very good.I also added a envelope of onion soup mix and green pepper.
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I used ground turkey, added some chopped carrots and minced fresh parsley, and cut back a little on the brown sugar in the sauce. This recipe is super yummy!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I have been using this recipe for a long time and everyone just loves it. They all ask for the recipe which I am happy to share. It's so easy and sooo good! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This is my husband's favorite! It is a regular in our home. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This recipe is what my husband and I call Oh my God Good ! We LOVED it! It was, by far, the best recipe for meatloaf I have ever tried. Just as little FYI, try to use ground beef with the lowest fat content you can find. Otherwise, the splatter and smoke while baking gets a little out of control! LOL! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This is one of my most requested ground beef meals. I usually double the glaze because it is so yummy! I also double the oats so it makes more. Definately doesn't taste like a traditional meatloaf at all. More like an indulgent oval meatball ! You can't really taste the cheese, it just ads to the richness. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This will definitely go in our family favorite cookbook!! Yummy!!
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This is the best meatloaf recipe in the world. I love the sauce! I've made this for many of my friends and they all love it, even people who don't usually like meatloaf! 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#1#This recipe was not terrible, however I do not care to make it again. The family did not care for the recipe either. 
Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Great recipe! My husband is not a fan of meatloaf but raves about this recipe! i have made it twice in the last month at his request! The only change I made was I added ground pork (1/2 burger, 1/2 ground pork) both times and this last time I added chopped green pepper and carrots. 5 stars all the way!

Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I've been making this recipe since it was first published. I make it into one meatloaf and bake for an hour ( I also reduce the amount of brown sugar to make the topping less sweet) I once suggested trying a different meatloaf recipe and my husband and daughter threatened to leave if I didn't make this one!

Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I have made this several times, my whole family love them, I double everything using 2 lbs of burger, I do not put the sauce on to bake as directed, it all runs off into the grease, they like to put it on afterwards & on their potaotes. A family favorite, Enjoy !

Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Love these little meat loaves and make them frequently. I cut the ketchup to 1/3c, the brown sugar to 1/8c or less and the mustard to 3/4tsp. Makes just enough sauce and cuts down on the sweetness too.

Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#Yummy! Have been making for years. Very moist. Was great for feeding my son when he was a toddler and wanted to eat what we were eating. Also like the extra dairy in there. Great way to sneak into my son's diet as he's not a very good milk drinker.

I also added some bacon strips on top. It was good, but not amazing as other recipes Ive tried. Ill make it again when I need something fast

When I checked at 25 minutes, there were lots of liquid, I had to set the oven at 375 for another 25 minutes or more until it was drier. I think you did not waited until the liquid evaporated. Actually it is pretty good and not soft at all.

Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#The meat stayed very soft, the oats were completely the WRONG starch to add, and the sauce was sickeningly sweet. It couldn't even be salvaged by being made into a sandwich. I can't believe so many people liked this. Gross, just plain gross!

Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#This is the absolute BEST meatloaf. Normally my husband refuses to eat leftovers, but he will gladly eat these two (or even three!) nights in a row! These come out perfectly moist every time. Reading the reviews, it sound like some find the sauce to be too sweet, but we love it - it's delicious and I use every last drop. I haven't found another meatloaf recipe that comes close to this one!

Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I love meatloaf but wanted to try a different recipe my husband and I love cheese so I decided to give this one a try. It is delicious but do agree there is a bit much brown sugar in it but that can be fixed. Thank you for the idea and love that they are mini so you can pack them in your lunch box for work and have a little hunk of meat to munch on. Will definitely be making this for years to come.

Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves#0#0#I've never been happy with my meatloaf, so I tried this recipe last night. My husband and I really liked it. I added a little black pepper and about a teaspoon of dried parsley. Also, the sauce was a little sweet for me, so next time I'll just cut back on the brown sugar a little. But I will definitely be making this again!  (2 weeks later)  My husband asked me to make this meatloaf again for supper tonight, proving that he really liked it. It's so good, and easy to make.

Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#1#0#We loved it. Making it for the second time because my daughter begged us to make it again.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#5#2#I used a 9oz package of spinach and cheese refrigerated tortellini because that was all they had. Turned out awesome, so much flavor!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#9#0#Used hot Italian sausage and used all chicken broth, no water. Comes together really quickly but has a lot of great flavor!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#4#5#We love this recipe! Even my very picky teenage sons gobbles it up. I sub one package of frozen spinach (12 oz), 1/2 package of frozen tortellini and use one pound of sweet Italian sausage. A great soup!!!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#6#0#This soup was very good. I accidentally picked up Italian diced stewed tomatoes but it still very good. I will be making this many more times. Thanks so much for the recipe.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#2#0#This is a easy and delicious soup my family asks for it all the time, it's great for a cold New England day!!!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#1#0#What a delicious surprise! This was easy to make and it was so tasty. I'm not a huge fan of cooked spinach but this was very good. This is definitely going in my file of favorite soups. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#3#1#Guys, if you need a fast, easy, recipe with limited ingredients that you can switch out this is the one!. It comes out fast and great tasting, I substitute swiss chard for spinach, grew mountains of it, threw in half a bag of frozen tortellini as the fresh only comes 5 oz packages at my store. Adjust the red pepper flakes as your family likes. Keeping this one for that need a quick healthy dinner.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#2#0#One of my go-to meals and I have been making for many years. Always a sure fire hit. Can add more veggies or spices if you'd like. Sometimes we use the hot spicy sausage, gives it more of a kick. GREAT recipe. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#4#0#Doubled the recipe but used a quart of chicken broth and a bit of extra water, used a big package of baby spinach and 2 packages of al fresco Chicken Sausage, Sweet Italian Style. It was so good. Had a nice rich flavor, took it to my MIL's for dinner. She made sure we left enough for 3 meals. I used an 8 quart crockpot, cooked it for about 3 hours on low. So very good!! Having for dinner again tonight, my husband wants me to make it again!! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#13#2#The only change I made was using cooked, until browned and caramelized, hot Italian sausage, chopped. I only added amount of tortellini we were having that night, added fresh tortellini the second time. It's also freezer friendly, without the tortellini. So simple and so delicious!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#1#1#My Boyfriend is a trainer and picky eater this fit the bill for us both!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#51#20#This was so delicious I have made it several times. Question though - could I brown the meat etc and then throw everything in a crockpot on low for 6 hours so it's ready when I get home? Thanks 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#6#0#What a delicious and simple soup! I cooked it exactly as written, and it was perfect. We especially liked the slight burn of the red pepper flakes. Definitely a keeper!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#2#0#I really enjoyed this. I wanted a quick lunch and made do with things I had on hand. I used a smoked sausage cut into chunks, frozen tortellini, and had to skip the spinach since I didn't have any. It was still really good! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#8#2#I've made this soup dozens of times since the recipe was first published and it's a family favorite. I also make it often to bring as a gift meal for new parents, people recovering from surgery or illness, etc., and it is always well received. it comes together so fast, it's a great I can make this after work type of meal. Absolutely delicious! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#2#0#Best soup,I always double it . My husband is not a soup eater and he requests this soup every two weeks. When I make this my mom has to come over. Thank you for this yummy soup.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#6#0#I make a similar soup but also add Zucchini, Yellow Squash and Carrots
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#2#0#oh my goodness!!! this came out so good! i did switch out the pepper flakes for cayenne since i didn't have the flakes. so yummy! unfortunately my kid didn't like the spinach (eye roll) cant please everyone 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#2#1#Awesome soup! Great flavor and very flexible for what's on hand. House smelled like Italian restaurant and everyone loved! We like the kick red pepper flakes adds so we use about 1/4 teaspoon. As a volunteer field editor with Taste of Home magazine I love great tasting dishes that are easy to customize!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#New family favorite. Instead of water add more chicken broth, instead of diced tomatoes add diced tomatoes with green chili (rotel works well). Wonderful with fresh bread.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#1#0#My husband said This recipe is a keeper! I don't hear that very often from him. Great taste with a little zip to the broth. Will definitely make this again.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I've made this a couple of times. Very flavorful and filling. I love this delicious soup.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#1#0#I made this a couple of months ago and my husband, who is not a fan of soup, mentioned it tonight and would like to have it again. We did not have much leftover when I made it so it was definitely enjoyed by our children, too.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#9#0#Amy, I'd suggest that you just add the frozen tortellini to the soup and let it simmer until the pasta is done - it should only take a couple of minutes more than indicated for the refrigerated tortellini alone. This has become my husband's favorite cool-weather soup. I've found that we always have leftovers with just the two of us and the tortellini tastes great in this soup, but it absorbs a large amount of the broth after the first day and kind of takes over . I discovered that replacing the tortellini with fresh gnocchi is a fabulous substitution and the gnocchi is much better behaved in the leftover soup. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#4#0#I love this soup! A friend passed it to me and it's so so good! If I have frozen refrigerated tortellini , should I cook first or thaw & add? Thx! Submitting this comment for 2nd time because I forgot to click the stars??
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This soup has so much flavor,and we will be making this dish from now on. I doubled my recipe and even leftovers were amazing.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#1#I don't cook often so I like easy & delicious recipes. This one was super easy & has tons of flavor. I did use Italian sausage instead & added 4oz of cheese tortellini. I will definitely be making this again. So happy I tried it!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#3#0#This is very yummy. Family loved it. Making it again but wanted to know if you can make ahead or will the tortellini get all mushy?
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#3#1#Funny thing, I saw this recipe less than 2 days after I saw another very similar recipe on another website.... And it wasn't what I was looking for at all. So I took it as a sign that I should give it a try. The other recipe didn't use any meat, but it had carrots & celery with the onion, and it also used zucchini. I mixed both ecipes 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#1#0#This is a great recipe. We subbed Kielbasa sliced thin for the Turkey sausage-added two cans white navy beans (rinsed and drained well). Low sodium chicken broth. TASTY and AMAZING recipe!!!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#10/10 simple and delicious. I did use hot Italian sausage and celery as well, turned out great! Thank you
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#1#0#This soup is beyond amazing! It is the best tortellini soup on the planet, prepared exactly as written! WOW!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This soup is amazing?? my husband and I loved. The second time I made it I left out the tomato's, and used shredded chicken instead of the sausage & mozzarella and chicken tortellini instead of just cheese and it is now one of my top favorite meals.. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is a great tasting and hearty soup with bursting flavor. I like it with a rustic French bread. My family loves it!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This was great. I used spicy Italian sausage and sausage tortellini loved it

Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Excellent, hearty, and easy to make. I added a dash of red peppers as directed and it was enough that I will be a bit lighter on my dash next time, it doesn't take much to flavor the soup. Obviously, that is a matter of taste. Definitely one I will make again. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Pure comfort food, purely perfection. I chose all fresh organic ingredients and used spicy chicken sausage. I seved this soup with some warm buttered Italian bread.

Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Simple, easy and fabulous flavor!!! I made it per the recipe and wouldn't change a thing. It was hearty and flavorful - could not stop eating it! Shared with a friend - will put this in the favorites book!! Serving suggestion - good warm crusty bread with roasted garlic and a glass of red wine!!!! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Simple and quick and very tasty. I would use regular chicken broth instead of reduced sodium. It was good using the reduced sodium broth but just a little better after I added some salt.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Husband and I love this recipe. Easy to make!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I love this! It's tasty and easy. Just right for a light meal. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#2#Absolutely love this! It was also actually easy to make. No hidden steps in between the other steps to prepare food for cooking. Used pre-chopped container of onion, and pre-minced garlic to make this even faster with no chopping. Made exactly per recipe (using sweet italian sausage) -- no swapping out water for more chicken broth, and it was perfect. If I had made that swap, as some readers did, it would have been too potent for our taste. Recipe perfect as is.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Great recipe that makes a delicious meal, and will be on repeat this fall and winter. Easy skill level and quick. Per other reviews, I used all chicken broth in place of water and added (1) 15 oz can great northern beans. I had a 16 oz package of tortellini and used it all, the liquid was sufficient for that amount and it makes a heartier portion. It is perfect as is but next time I am going to add a parmesan rind for extra rustic taste.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#My picky family loves this soup. The only changes are....we use hot Italian sausage. We also make a double batch....always:)
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#We make this almost weekly in our house; we love to use it for lunches for the week. I try to always have the ingredients on hand, but the best thing about this recipe is that you can easily alter it, and it's still good. We use Wegman's chicken sausage in various flavors (usually mild italian and sundried tomato and basil), and if I don't have fresh garlic, garlic powder works fine. I also use frozen cut leaf spinach instead of fresh. It always turns out great, even when I double the recipe! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Absolutely love this and so easy to make! My grocery store only had hot turkey sausage, so I opted instead for the precooked Jimmie Dean sausage crumbles. The textures and flavors just go together so well!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#One of our favorites just as is, but being a tweaker I added a can of great northern beans....YUM!!!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#1#I usually twerk a recipe to my own taste. This was perfect as is. It will be a staple recipe in our house. Thank you!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I loved this soup soon as I tried it at a lunch I went to. So I tried it at home and my husband absolutely loved it too. It's now my go to soup and I just change it up by using different meats such as Johnsonville brats sliced then cooked or taken out of the casings & cooked and I use chicken breasts too. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Yummy. Doesn't freeze well with the tortellini in it. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I do not post many reviews, but have taken TOH magazine since it started an I am a big fan. I did want to post this soup recipe because it is delicious ! When I make a recipe for the 1st time I usually follow it as I did this one, with the exception of I used all broth an no water, which was 3 cans. I could not find turkey links this time so I used Johnsonville Chicken Garlic links an just sliced them up an browned them with the onion. I thought this would taste bland without adding other seasonings but, I was wrong. It tasted great! Thank you Tracy for this gem!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#My whole family loved this soup! Such delicious flavor! I substituted a large can of tomato soup for the diced tomatoes and used ground sweet Italian sausage in place of the turkey sausage. I will definitely make this again for my family.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This soup was amazing! I thought since it had limited ingredients and was a quick soup it would lack in flavor but that was not the case. The only thing I did differently was use spicy bulk sausage. This one is a keeper.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is my go to soup when asked to bring soup to a function. It's always a hit and I'm asked for the recipe. The only change I made was to use a pound of italian sausage or hot italian, depending on where it's going. Thanks for sharing I love this soup!! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#1#0#This was really really good... I love soups and I do 95% of all the cooking in the house.. My wife only realy will eat soups in the winter( to me that's just crazy.. Soups are awesome) wife and both kids couldn't get enough( with the kids both 16 arguing about how to split the last bowls worth.. The changes and additions I made are for the proteins I used 4 boneless chicken thighs diced and browned in pot. 2 chicken sausage links with sun dried tomatoes browned in skillet then sliced.. For the water I used more chicken broth.. I also added 2 large carrots sliced and a mid to small zucchini halfed length ways and sliced . I half the amount of garlic and added salted to taste (prob about 1/2 teaspoon) and I added the sausage at the same time as the tortellini 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#1#Absolutely loved this! My mom wouldn't eat it because of the pasta, but too bad for her!! I made half the recipe since it was just myself to eat it. Had it for lunch for a few days too, but that was okay! I used hot pork sausage, but I like things hot! Would definitely make again, especially during a winter storm.....nummy!! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is one of our family favorites!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#1#Everyone in my family loves this soup, even the kids who are picky eaters. The first time I made this I only had ground turkey sausage on hand, so I used that. I also use all chicken broth instead of adding water.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#1#1#I absolutely love this recipe, it has fantastic flavor, and it's very appealing to look at! Two changes I made from the original recipe, is to use plain ground pork over sausage, and I add some cubed butternut squash. Also not bad if you happen to not have the tortellini (because you ran out of the store without grabbing it) to use some other type of pasta, like farfalle. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I absolutely love this soup! Like many, I made a couple of changes to the recipe. I used plain ground pork in place of the sausage, and often like to add some cubed butternut squash. It's great!Edit: I have no idea why I made two posts. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Loved this! I used spicy turkey sausage which was really good in this. Then just added some Italian seasoning. Quick and easy too!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#A friend recommended this recipe. Made the soup for the first time. My husband is asking for it again within a few days. Loved it!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#1#Easy and filling, served with garlic/cheese sticks. Only change I made was to use turkey meat balls. Will definitely make again.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Family favourite. I use 5c prepared chicken broth in place of the canned broth and water and spicy Italian sausage (3 or 4 links removed from casing and crumbled)
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I too made my own adjustments. I had cooked 1/2 chicken breast in crock , then used frozen spinach. So darn good & easy!!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is definitely a family favorite. I've been making it for over a year, but I, too, have made a few minor changes to it. I use a one-pound package of regular pork sausage instead of the turkey sausage links. Then, to make up for the lack of Italian flavor, I added 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning. And to save time, I also threw in a few handfuls of frozen spinach instead of dealing with fresh spinach. Like most soups, it gets even better after it sits overnight--assuming that it lasts that long! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Super quick, easy, and delicious! I will definitely make this again. (Even my picky 6-year old liked it!)
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is a hearty and wonderfully flavored soup! I used spicy Italian sausage, added 1 chopped green pepper, a couple chopped carrots, and a cup of corn and some extra broth. Delish!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Turkey Italian sausage is very bland so I added some fennel seed, anise seed and oregano. Very good, especially with my husband's homemade Italian bread. I think next time I will use regular Italian sausage for better flavor. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#2#I used hot italian sausage and added half a cup of heavy cream at the end and it was fantastic. Got rave reviews from my family.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#2#1#This is a full-bodied soup that makes a great meal, with a side of crusty bread. I used the hot Italian turkey sausage because we like spicy food. There was mild, not overpowering heat. The preparation was quick and easy. The result is a delicious homemade soup.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I've made this soup several times as well but with hot Italian sausage. Great flavor and so easy to make. It is amazing! Definitely a keeper!! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#1#Fantastic recipe. I made it and the family loved it. It's a regular on the menu now. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I've made this soup several times, it is amazing. So much flavor. I only make one change, i use hot Italian sausage. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#i made this for a dinner party and served it in sip'n style bowls I ordered on amazon.It was perfect. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I made this recipe and everyone raved over it!! It was absolutely delicious. Everyone wanted recipe. That's how you really know if they like it or are just being nice. My daughter in-law loved it and she hates soup! I, however, went with the original version and used spicy italian sausage rather than turkey sausage or ground turkey, but I'm sure they would also be fine. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#On this icy cold Michigan winter day this hot soup was AWESOME! I used Italian chicken sausage cut into chucks, in addition to the actual recipe I added some fresh sliced mushrooms, fresh sugar snap peas that were in the fridge and about a tablespoon of chicken soup base. I posted a picture of my masterpiece online, it looked fabulous. I only wish some of my friends were closer so they could have tasted the yummyiness too.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I made this soup last night and it was so amazing I am sharing it with everyone I know. I made a few changes due to lack of reading the recipe fully. I used pork Italian sausage instead of turkey and let it brown really well. I omitted both peppers, red pepper because my little tongue doesn't do well with spice and black because I failed to see it when I read the recipe. I used dried basil because my market was out of fresh. Other than that I made it exactly as the recipe reads, even with the water, which did not dilute the flavor at all. I will make this over and over again, I cannot express how good it was. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Super easy and delicious! My daughter keep asking me to make this one again :D
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I loved this soup! Great flavor combination and only gets better the next day. The addition of sausage makes it a hearty meal all by itself. Grate some fresh Parmesan over the top and it is heaven. Would definitely make this one again.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Made a huge pot of this soup for Christmas Bunco with the girls. At someone's suggestion, I cooked it a day ahead to let the flavors blend overnight. I used Italian sausage (like hamburger) from the meat department. I too omitted the water and added extra chicken broth. I'm not fan of spinach so I used escarole lettuce instead. It turned bright green and with the ITALIAN tomatoes I used, the soup had colors of red and green and really looked festive. Oh and I used whole wheat tortellini. I served it with the Onion Swiss Cheese Bread Ring and that heavenly Marinated Olive and Cheese Ring. Everyone raved about the meal! We had Christmas cookies for dessert. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#1#1#Husband and I loved this. I used Johnsonville Hot'n Spicy Bratwurst (19 oz), forgot the water and chose not to use the Parmesan cheese. It was absolutely delicious and filling with just the right amount of kick...keeps you coming back for more. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Great for the holidays
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#1#I used mild Italian sausage as I can't get turkey sausage where we live. We found it salty and lacking flavour. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Fantastic satisfying weeknight meal. I made it vegetarian using vegetable broth and Tofurkey sun dried tomato and basil Italian sausage . Delicious! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Perfect! There is a reason so many people have given this recipe 5 stars.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#A favorite for sure. Made it 3 times so far, used tomatoes out of my garden but otherwise followed the recipe. Delicious!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I love this soup!!! I cook the tortellini before adding it to the soup at the end.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#loved it - used hot italian sausage.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#2#I only give a 3 star because Italian food should not be HOT!!!Eliminated the red pepper flakes, thank you very much. Otherwise, simple, easy and good. Oh ya, used home grown tomatoes, cooked down.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I scrolled past this recipe on the TOH site and saw all the great reviews. Decided to try and WOW! Wonderful flavor, easy to throw together and a satisfying meal. We used a hot turkey sausage and loved the kick. I can see this being a regular recipe in our fall/winter lineup. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#1#0#Delish! Substitutions made. Used sweet italian sausage, fresh chicken stock, chopped tomatoes w/basil, sweet Italian sausage tortellini, creole seasoning (instead of pepper). Added spice and flavor!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#My husband said this is his new favorite! I used two 32 oz cartons of chicken broth and omitted the water, Johnsonville mild Italian sausage, frozen spinach thawed and squeezed dry, and diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings. Really nice flavor. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#VERY GOOD!!!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Outstanding!! need I say more......
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I made this soup yesterday and LOVED it! It was really quick and easy to make. I am sitting at work wishing I would have brought some for lunch.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Outstanding flavour! My whole family loved this soup. They told me it's a'keeper', which in my family means it becomes part of our regular rotation of meals. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Very good...But forget the turkey sausage and use real pork.. I also add a little more tortellini. Just my preference...And I used stewed tomatoes in place of diced...Other than that, excellent...
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#We love this soup. Very filling and delicious.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is so easy and tasty, actually better the next day.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#One of our favorite soups! So good!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Excellent! I like to use kale instead of spinach sometimes.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This was fabulous!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#My family loved this!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#1#0#This soup was awesome! Great flavor and it took me 30 minutes to make and tasted like it simmered for three hours. I used only 1 cup of water (more chicken broth), used diced tomatoes with oregano and onion, and fat-free/reduced sodium chicken broth to reduce the calories further. I also had frozen tortellini so I used those as I think they hold up better than fresh.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#5 stars!!!Love the flavor! I used garlic with olive oil diced tomatoes and chicken stock instead of water.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I sauteed shredded kale with no stems with the onion and added carrots, add garlic after. I generally find adding garlic and other potentially harsher arromatics later so they don't burn is the right call. I then added a teaspoon of sweet paprika, a bay leaf, and two thyme sprigs right before the broth and tomatoes (replace water with all broth). Turned out fantastic. For the finer palate, a cup of gruyere added really is awesome in lieu of parmesan. Should note I doubled the recipe as well so all measures reflect that. Dankness. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Very good ......I subtititued escarole for spinach...excellent
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Love this recipe! I did make a couple changes, I added carrots when cooking the onions, and I used canned tomatoes seasoned with garlic and onion ( included the juices) I also included a bag of frozen green beans before adding the spinach and tortellini. My husband does not care for soups generally, however he LOVES this soup!!! Definitely a keeper!!!!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is wonderful!! Made a few changes based solely on family preferences. Halved the garlic, used all chicken broth, and 1/4 t. Dried basil, then very low simmer (covered) for 30 minutes. My family likes tri color penne , so actually boiled that separately, and set up a soup bar where you could assemble this any way you like. Pasta, spinach, ladle soup over , cheese. A huge keeper. Thank you! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#The best soup ever!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This soup was amazing! Even if you are not into this type of soup, it is a MUST try. I used red onion, spicy sausage instead of the turkey sausage; chicken broth instead of water (added extra), and a carton of fresh Cherub cherry tomatoes instead of a can of diced tomatoes. Enjoy!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Best soup I've ever had. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Loved it
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This turned out well.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Easy & yummy! My husband LOVES this soup! I've changed it up on occasion by substituting fresh green beans for spinach (or add both), use pre-cooked thawed italian meatballs cut into quarters, or roasted cherry tomatoes to add. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#made with meat tortelli 2nd time and was very good as well/ instead of sausage
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#My husband loves this soup. I add more broth so that it is not so thick.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This was very easy to make. If you like it soupier , add a little more broth. I made everything as is and the family wants me to cook it again! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#2#I made a few changes to this soup to accommodate what I had on hand. It was super easy and delicious! I'm not a fan of sausage so I omitted that. I added sweet peppers to the onion. And used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I also didn't have fresh spinach so I thawed some frozen spinach, squeezed it and crumbled that in. I would definitely make this again. The red pepper flakes gave it a hint of spice and the parmesan cheese on top was a nice finishing touch. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is the most excellent soup that you can make. It is quick and easy. Our family loves it.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Yum! Will make again.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is a family favorite! I use spicy regular Italian Sausage.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#1#0#Absolutely delicious!! The parmesan cheese added while the soup is served adds to the flavor. The only change I made was to add more chicken broth ...6-7 cups of broth and omitted the water. Since the tortellini absorbs some of the liquid, not enough liquid is left for leftovers if more broth is not added at the start.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#bland...I think jimmy dean original sausage would have been better. probably won't cook again. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#No wonder this recipe is a contest winner. It was delicious - very flavorful - and hearty. I used a total of two 32 oz Swanson chicken broth boxes because I thought it needed more broth to match the tortellini and because of other reviewers saying the same thing... I was glad I did. I did not use the water because of what other reviewers said about replacing it with broth, which my bigger boxes of broth took care of. I skipped the can of diced tomatoes because I'm not a fan but I can see how they would add to the soup for others. The recipe calls for turkey sausage but I used regular Italian sausage and it calls for 12 oz but I had 16 oz so I used the whole thing. For the refrigerated tortellini, I used the tiny cheese raviolettis that Buitoni offers. I used fresh spinach from one of the 9 oz salad bags (probably used about 7 oz of it and didn't chop it up) and I did two tablespoons of the fresh basil because I love it. I used more than a dash of red pepper... did a couple of shakes. We did put shredded parmesan on top and I highly recommend. I served the soup with really good five grain bread and butter and, as I write this, I wish I was having the meal again tonight because it was AMAZING. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Hot italian sausage is the way 2 go and the soup pot was empty. A definate keeper!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Great recipe! Fast and delicious. My 6 year old loves it and he is a tough critic. Btw I used both sweet and spicy sausage.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Made it with hot Italian sausage. Loved it! It was very tasty and colorful. Was as good or better than soups served in restaurants.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#didn't like it 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is the best, easiest soup I've ever made. No changes are necessary. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I used hot sausage and added more sausage/pasta than it called for and it turned out GREAT! My husband loved it and I love it!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This soup is quick, easy, and delicious all in one!!! I've made this many times and my fiance loves it!!!!!! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Made this over the weekend and it was deicious!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This was good. I substituted what I had on hand. Used a box of frozen spinach and substituted 8 oz of a bagged tortellini. Used a roasted diced tomato which had some additional seasoning. My picky son liked it. so I'd say it was a hit.. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#this is one of my favorite soups now. used fresh tomatoes and spinach from farmers market when making it the first time and it was delicious. Tastes just as good maybe better second day
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#2#This recipe has become one of my Family Favorites! It makes a great Meatless Monday dinner ... I just omit the sausage and add a package of cream cheese (cut into cubes) 5 minutes before serving. Allow the cream cheese to melt and stir into the soup for added richness.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Delicious!!! Used sweet basil sausage & Italian seasoned tomatoes.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Absolutely fabulous. This has been in my recipe box for some time. Finally, got to try it tonight. It was enjoyed by all. Thanks so much for sharing this fabulous recipe.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Fabulous! (I have meat-eaters in the family, so I cooked the hot Italian turkey sausage with a pound of ground turkey. When I make this again, I'll add some bite-sized chicken to the turkey as well. I used crushed Italian tomatoes instead of the diced variety. Next time I will also add the tortellini to each bowl because the leftovers soaked up too much of the liquid.) You gotta try this recipe! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#A really awesome soup. I love how I can get different flavors from every spoonful. I made it with regular sausage because I couldn't find turkey sausage nor did I care for it that much. Came out wonderful, but I was a little spicy. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Love Love loved it! Did I mention that I loved it. I had been looking for a soup that wasn't so full of salt, healthy YET delicious! This was wonderful, tasty, hearty and VERY fulfilling. The only thing I did differently was add stewed tomatoes instead of diced. I like the chunky tomatoes, plus it adds more veggies to your meal. Its cold here now so I am excited to get off and head to the grocery store so that I can make a pot tonight! Yummy! p.s. if you sprinkle a little Parmesan shredded cheese on top its gives it an even better flavor! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Very filling soup. Great for a cold winter night. I used all chicken stock and eliminated the water. Also added chopped celery and carrots. I made mine in the crockpot and let it simmer while at work. Just cooked the tortellini and added it and the basil and spinach before serving. It tastes great the next day.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Everytime I serve this to guests they want the recipe! I bet we have this once a month for dinner. I use Italian style chopped tomatoes and it gives it even more flavor. Great recipe.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Really enjoyed this soup, quick and easy to make too! I used spicy sausages to give it some extra spice.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is the only soup my entire family (including kids age 7 & 3) loves! I use a pound of ground turkey sausage and season it with a mixture I found at http://www.food.com/recipe/turkey-breakfast-sausage-patties-100408. I also use all chicken broth (no water), and I double the tortellini. Very filling, easy, and delicious!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I have made this soup several times and we enjoy it more each time! I use bulk Italian sausage instead which saves time. It is so easy to make and perfect on a cold night with crusty Italian bread!!! I also add mushrooms, and red and green peppers on top of everything it already calls for and it's always amazing!!! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Used Johnsonville hot Italian sausage and closer to 9 oz. spinach. All three of my kids said they'd have liked it to have had more tortellini. Overall, very good though. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Easy and tasty
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Every one in family absolutely loves it!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#amazing soup
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#My whole family enjoyed this recipe - I substituted spinach for mushrooms because that's what I had on hand, and I added a less water than is called for in the recipe. This was a quick and easy weeknight meal! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Love it! I made two pots of soup using this recipe yesterday for a family dinner. One pot was exactly as written and it was wonderful, will definitely make again and again. The other pot of soup was for vegetarians, so it was meatless; I used vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth and, for variety, butternut squash ravioli in place of the tortellini. What was leftover went for lunch today so it was very good also.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Excellent. A new family favorite!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Everyone LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this! Definitely a keeper!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This recipe is truly excellent. But I suggest a couple alterations for finicky eaters. I used CRUSHED tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes, it gives the broth a wonderful red color, plus you get the flavor of tomatoes without the texture. Second, I add about 3 medium petitley diced carrots and saute them with the onions and sausage. You get an extra veggie serving in there and it adds a pop of color, almost too pretty to eat! It's a real hit with everyone, I've started tripling the recipe and freezing it so I always have some on hand. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#4 1/2 stars, very good and easy to fix
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I made this soup substituting vegetarian sausage for the italian sausage and vegetable broth for the chicken broth and the vegetarians and meat lovers at my house all loved it.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Amazing - one of the best soups I've ever made!

Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#The best soup ever. I made it for a family gathering and everyone raved about it. I added a can of Rotel to zip it up a bit!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This was so good. Even my picky family loved it and asked for seconds. I used a large chicken broth and decreased the water to only a cup. Next time I will omit the water and use more broth
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This recipe was marvelous. Even my vegetable shy daughter ate it- spinach and all! We're definitely making this one again. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is one of the easiest recipes I've ever made. But instead of using Turkey sausage, I used Johnsonville Three Cheese Italian Style Chicken Sausages. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I only edited one major thing in this recipe, and that was the onions. My fiance doesn't like regular onions but will eat green onions if I put them in soup, so I used a stalk of green onions chopped in exchange for an onion. I also nearly tripled the amount of tortellini, and I used three cans of chicken broth instead of the one can chicken broth + water. I ended up buying a 16 ounce package of Italian Sausage instead of of taking a part 3 4-ounce sausages. So, other than changing the amount I put in of certain ingredients, lol, I nearly followed the recipe, and it was fantastic! I'll be keeping this recipe for years to come! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is super easy to make, ready in no time and delicious. Everyone I've ever served it to has loved it. Paired with some crusty bread, this is a mega-pleasing lunch or dinner! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I doubled this recipe, used tri-colored tortellinis and ground turkey instead of sausage. To add some spicy flavor I used one can of diced tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes w/chiles. I also added a can of white beans (drained/rinsed). This is such a hearty, delicious soup!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Wasn't sure about the recipe when I started out with the first few ingredients but LOVED the end result! I used whole grain tortellini and added some fresh tomato. I let the first 6 ingredients simmer for about 1 hour before I added the rest. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#My family LOVES this! My sister in law even wanted the recipe. Its a quick, easy, family pleasing meal!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#My husband and I made this recipe together...It was amazing!!! Thank you for the post, I will definitely be making this recipe again!!! :)

Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This was absolutely wonderful....I just substituted turkey for the turkey sausage...I hate sausage..WONDERFUL!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I have been looking for a good tasting & easy restaurant quality tortellini soup-this recipe is a keeper. I doubled it, used frozen tortellini & frozen spinach. I also used hot turkey sausage and homemade chicken stock. Very filling, but also light, tasty, no added salt and good for you. I love the ease that this comes together-one pot, chop an onion & garlic and toss everything else in. It was finished so quickly too..a little parmesan adds salt and creaminess that makes it just perfect. Yummo.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Very yummy! Doubled this and used home canned tomatoes and thawed swiss chard instead of spinach. Next day the tortellini's started falling apart and absorbed a lot of the liquid still very tasty but better the first day. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#1#0#I used precooked turkey sausage breakfast patties chopped instead of the links. It was absolutely wonderful!! It freezes very well, tastes just as fresh as the day it's made. I added a dash of cayan pepper instead of the red pepper flakes, and doubled up on the tomatoes. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I just made this tonight. It was a hit! Great taste, easy and healthy!

Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I have now made this yummy soup several times. My family and coworkers all agree it's a keeper!

Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#DELISH!!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Great flavor and easy to make. I didn't have any Italian sausage so I used country sausage and added Italian seasoning and some fennel. Otherwise I pretty much made it as written and served it with small sandwiches. Great meal for the Fall.

Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#added left over chicken, cilantro, celery and sundried tomatoes - DELICIOUS... no one knew they were eating leftovers. I kept the sausages also but used chicken/apple sausages.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Awesome! We used 4 regular italian sausage links, rather than the 3 italian turkey sausage links suggested. Also, I kept the casings on the sausage - much easier.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I make this all the time, light, healthy and delicious!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This soup is fantastic!! Major raves reviews and seconds by all made this pot disappear quickly.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I love this recipe!!! I have used ground beef or regular Italian sausage.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Everyone enjoyed the soup along with slices of Garlic Bread. I used 1 lb. of ground Italian Pork Sausage instead of links. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is. Very, Very, Good!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I actually prepared this recipe with a 28 ounce can of Ro-Tel Diced Tomatoes & Green Chilies, a 32oz. carton of Beef Broth and a 19 oz. bag of frozen Cheese Totellini,defrosted. I added a dash of Tabasco instead of the red pepper flakes and used the sweet Turkey links as well. I am one of those cooks who believes in improvising with ingredients on hand and recipes always seems turned out well for me. Be Creative!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Made this for guinea pig guests. Excellent, easy and quick. This is going in the permanent file.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is the BEST soup! For the italian sausage, I use one half Johnsonville Italian Hot and one half Johnsonville Italian Sweet. It's a nice blend and gives the soup a little bite. I also add sliced fresh mushrooms. Took it to a soup and sandwich at church and received several requests for the recipe.

Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is my husband's favorite soup. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I forgot to mention that I used 2- 28 oz cans of Hunt's diced tomatoes for my double batch. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#My husband and I loved this very much, though I admit to making a few changes to suit our tastes.I doubled the recipe for a bigger batch and used 10 links of Johnsonville spicy italian pork sausage (my man likes meat) instead of 6 turkey sausage links. I sliced the sausage into pieces and added the garlic with the onions and meat from the start instead of waiting. I added the dried basil, black pepper, and red pepper flakes when I added the broth and tomatoes (I did not add any water) so it would cook longer in the soup and pull more flavors out. (I used more seasoning than recipe called for and used 2 heaping tsps of dried basil, 1 tsp of black pepper, and added 3/4 tsp red pepper to suit our need for heat)I also added 3 tbs of chicken bouillon and 1 heaping tsp of onion powder because we like our flavors stronger and the tomatoes were a bit too dominant. The rest I just followed the recipe and voila! Going to make this over and over again. :)
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Loved the soup,! I will cut back on the water next time, just for more flavor. I added sliced fresh mushrooms to mine. I may try to add pasta next time instead of the tortellini jut to see how it taste .....
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Everyone ate it and that is a big deal in my house. Usually, half will like, half won't (3 children, 5 adults). Didn't have tortellini or ravioli, so made due with rotini pasta. Also, omitted red pepper flakes cuz of the kids. Doubled the recipe of course and served with shredded mozarella (didn't have parm). Added garlic bread and viola! Yummy for all! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Tasted delicious , looked beautiful, and was easy to make. The perfect recipe!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Everytime I make this recipe for friends and co-workers I am asked for the recipe. This recipe rates 6 GOLD STARS!!!!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This has become a family favorite! Easy, quick and delicious!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Very good soup. Not a huge sausage fan. Tastes best the first day. More sausagey aroma after flavors meld.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#1#Such a easy, quick, delicious soup. Didn't have any tortellini, so I used cheese ravioli. My husband loved it! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is a great soup to impress. It is very easy and so delicious. Great with a side of crusty bread. Be sure to just barely cook the tortellini as they can overcook very quickly.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This recipe was so quick to fix and really delicious. My family said it's a keeper. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is one of the best soup recipes I have. Simple to make and packed full of flavor.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This soup is very delicious and very low fat and low calorie.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This soup is a snap to make, and it received heaps of praise from my mother-in-law when I made it for her! The soup is full of scrumptious flavors with just the right amount of heat.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#The flavor of this is incredible for such few and simple ingredients. I will make this many times. I used fresh basil and my local grocery only had sweet italian turkey so I was sure to give it a few shakes of red pepper flakes. The only thing I changed was I omitted the water. We like ours a little thicker and I like to avoid the carbs in the crackers that I typically use for that purpose. Two thumbs up. Oh and my eight yr old ate 3 bowls so your kids will like it too. :)
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This was so good and healthy and easy. It was a little spicy so I left out the papper & red pepper and used a little less turkey Italian sausage. The flavor was intense and the parmesan was a nice added touch. I will surely make this again.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Fast and delicious!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Absolutely fabulous! I used hot turkey sausage - I loved the pep this soup had. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I made 3 different soups for Super Bowl and this was the favority by far!! Husband said it was the best soup he ever had!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This soup is delicious! I will definitely make it again. I used loose hot, italian sausage that was surprisingly lean, because my husband loves spicy food, and I left out the pepper flakes. Next time I will try it with a different sausage just for a change, but this recipe is a keeper!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I LOVE this recipe! To add a little flair to it by adding 4oz of fat free cream cheese and a cap full of Mrs. Dash HOT seasoning
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This recipe is so simple and absolutely deliciouos. My family loved it. I will definitely be adding it to my regular recipe rotation.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is the first time, I've written a review...but it is also the first time I've felt compelled to! This is very tasty, for the amount of time and effort that is put into making the recipe. Very easy to make!!!I don't even like spinach...but this soup is soooo good!!I used sausage mince, in place of the Italian turkey sausage links, as this is what I had on hand.This was excellent and I will definitely be making this again!! Well done! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#My husband and I both agree this was delicious. Next time I will make a double batch so I can share it with family. Thank you MMB
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I made this last night and doubled the recipe, hoping to have leftovers. No such luck! My family loved this soup and said it's a keeper! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I used some bulk pork sausage that I had on hand, but I think I will try it with some bulk turkey Italian seasoned sausage to get the benefit of the lower calories. We really enjoyed the soup, and yes, I'll make it again! I served it with my home made Artisan bread with rosemary seasoning. Yum! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is one of our favorite soups! My husband and I fight over the leftovers and the kids love the tortellini and they even eat some of the spinach--I love that it is good for us too!
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Wow... so easy, so flavorful. It's on my list to repeat soon.Omitted the pepper flakes and used hot Italian sausage instead, like a couple of other posters did. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I Love this soup. It will be one that I will make again and again.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This is a great soup! I used hot Italian sausage and omitted the pepper flakes. It was so good I sent the recipe to my son who owns a bistro so he could try it too.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I love this soup. I didn't use the sausage, but added some left over shredded chicken instead. I didn't pre-cook the tortellini, I just let the soup simmer. Thank you for a great recipe!! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I love to make soup; this one has become one of my family's favorite. 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I didn't change anything except that I buy bulk Italian sausage (it's cheaper than links) and it has become my family's absolutely favorite soup. I love it because I can make it after work and know it will be a hit. I've also brought it to friends who need a meal. Great recipe! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#I liked this soup. I made a couple of small changes. I did not add the water, and I'm glad that I did. I used a low-sodium organic chicken broth. I also added about 1 Tbsp of tomato paste. I used HOT turkey sausage, so I didn't need the red pepper. I love basil, but I chose thyme and oregano as my seasoning.This recipe came together fast, and it is very good. Thanks! 
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Amazing flavor for a quick soup.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#This recipe was enjoyed even by my picky hubby! I added a can of cannellini beans, rinsed and drained, and it was terrific.
Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup#0#0#Great recipe.I used pork Italian sausage,frozen spinach and frozen tortellini because that is what I had on hand and it worked just as well.I definitely will keep making this 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Thus pie is so yummy
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#2#0#My new favorite summer pie. So refreshing
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#5#1#I have made this pie multiple times in the past. We loved it. So easy, and light, also.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#10#0#What a great recipe. I made one with lime, one with strawberry, and an orange one for a picnic. Your recipe is fantastic and so very versatile. :)
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#13#6#I have made this, with no changes many times, and it never lasts long! I also use this recipe, but use strawberry jello, strawberry yogurt, and if I have them on hand, fresh strawberries, sliced. Both are great for those warm summer days!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#42#0#To Dolores9364 Why give one star to something you don't choose to make? If you don't like the recipe and haven't made it, keep your opinion to yourself. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#24#26#1 important point that was missed. The mixed ingredients should be completely cool before folding in the whipped topping. Actually, in my case, I let the gelatin mixture completely cool before adding in the cold yogurt. That way the whipped topping retains more of its volume. I made this and it was very good. Not as good a real key lime pie, but way less calories.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#17#The pie shell was too big! I'm with Danital46, WILL NOT MAKE it AGAIN! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#6#13#Will not make this again. It was good, but did not get fluffy like the picture, and did not get firm when refrigerated. Maybe because I used regular Jello instead of sugar free?
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#15#0#While this isn't a traditional key lime pie, it's still a good pie. If you are looking for something light and slightly sweet, this is it. I've also varied the flavors and made peach, and strawberry. Really good, and always gobbled up!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#12#1#This is a very good and easy pie!! I have also substituted strawberry jello, and yogurt and some sliced fresh strawberries for another yummy pie!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#22#38#FYI all you pie fans. A Key Lime is a small seasonal lime, a separate fruit from a Persian lime. Only use Key Lime juice in pies or it's just a Lime Pie. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#24#15#Please review ingredient list! It says a small package of Lime Jello (.3 ounces). I think that's a mistake. Our small packages are 3 ounces not .3... So, I used the complete package..and it tasted delicious. Note: I did not use reduced fat ingredients. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#24#1#This was very good. Both my daughter and husband loved it. I did use regular lime gelatin because I couldn't find sugar free and I used regular whipped topping. Very easy to make. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#33#2#Excellent light key lime pie. Easy and quick to make. Want to try other flavors such as raspberry which someone suggested, maybe with a chocolate crumb crust and arranging some fresh raspberries on top.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#23#3#OMG this is so good. One of the best key lime pies I've ever made super easy only took 10 minutes. And so versatile. You could use numerous jello and yogurt flavors 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#5#0#whoops...I forgot to rate the recipe!:)
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#17#6#I've been making this for years & it is one of my families favorite desserts...expecially in the summer for a cool refreshing dessert. I started making my own greek yogurt a couple of years ago...& I have even used it to make the pies & use a real lime or lemon to flavor it. I also make different flavors using fresh raspberries, strawberries & peaches. It's hard to tell which one my family loves best. I do freeze the pies.....which, I think, makes them even better. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#2#1#Delicious!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#3#1#This is delicious, but I used Plant based whipped topping found at Whole Foods! Have tried Line, but would like to try raspberyt! Good low sugar dessert!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#7#0#Yummy and Light. I have been making various flavors with this recipe for years. We used to go camping and I would take the ingredients, then make this to share with our campground friends and it was always a hit.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#14#2#This has been a favorite in my household. I use 12 oz (1 & 1/2 bars) of cream cheese instead of the yogurt (not a fan), and use an additional 4 oz of cool whip on top. I use various Jello flavors. It is especially good with strawberry Jello and 1cup frozen sliced strawberries mixed in the filling. I also use the larger 9oz graham cracker crust to fit it all in. Love how easy this is. I always get compliments when serving to others. They can't believe how easy it is to make! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#5#0#Great recipe! Susan, I wanted to say that the 0.3 is correct. The sugar-free Jell-O 0.3 ounces and regular Jell-O is 3.0. You must've use the regular.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#10#This is a wonderfully easy, tasty & healthy dessert! My only comment is that the amount of gelatin is incorrect -- since it says one packet , I used the smallest size, which is 3.0 oz., Not 0.3 oz. -- just a typo when it was posted, I'm sure. I used the full 3 Oz. packet and it came out fine :) 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#4#2#This is an easy, wonderful, light dessert! I have made key lime, raspberry, and strawberry so far and plan to try more different flavors! I used regular gelatin and low-fat greek yogurt and light whipped topping. I didn't add all the whipped topping to the pie so I could put it on the pie along with fresh fruit when I served it. DELICIOUS! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#6#0#This recipe is for me. I followed the directions to the letter and it was fabulous. I made a low cholesterol graham cracker crust without butter to go with it. We put one of the pies in the freezer and it was a lovely frozen desert.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#5#0#This is a delicious pie. I was first introduced to it at a Weight Watcher meeting. It's a treat for those avoiding sugar. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#10#0#I am diabetic and love this pie I also make it with sugar free orange Jello and orange yougart makes a wonderful orange cream pie
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#Loved the crust. Made it with brown sugar. The filling wasn't very tasty. Added lime juice which helped a little. Will add more next time I make it. My family loved it as is and ate all of it. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#10#1#Love this pie. It tastes great and only takes 10 minutes to make. Sometimes I just make the filling and sprinkle crushed graham crackers over it.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#6#0#Love this easy, flavorful, summer recipe! If you are a key lime pie snob, it's obvious from the ingredients that it is not going to be true key lime pie; however, call it creamy lime flavored pie! Either way, mine came out delicious and it is great to serve on a warm summer evening. I used Chabani key lime flavored yogurt, just because I love the flavor of this yogurt by itself! Stick it in the freezer for about an hour before serving, and it's like eating an ice cream pie! Yummy!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#2#0#I made it, and it tasted great, however a package of knox gelatin was needed to make it firm. Today instead of Key Lime, I made it with Strawberries. Excellent!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This pie is super easy! You can also change up the flavor just by changing the Yogurt
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#7#46#This is absolutely the WORST Key Lime pie I have ever tasted. Maybe it's because I am a native Floridian but this is terrible. No one in my family would eat it and I had to throw it away. I made it on a trip to St Louis because I couldn't get key lime juice, but it was a waste of time and money. Disgusting. By the way, Key Lime pie is NEVER green. If it's green, it's not the real thing. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#5#0#I added juice from 1/4 of a large lime at the end and folded that in as well. Best key lime pie ever!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#3#1#Great recipe! I have made this pie twice. The first time, I made as key lime and the second time, I used strawberry gelatin and strawberry yogurt and they were both delicious! Our guests really enjoyed these pies. I am thinking of trying orange next! So quick and easy :)
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#3#0#I've been making this one for years. Hard to believe it's so easy and yet so delicious! I use sugar free gelatin and light whipped topping.. I've also made it with lemon gelatin and lemon yogurt. Sometimes I make it in an 8 x 8 square pan using just some graham cracker crumbs on the bottom instead of a crust to cut down on carbs. That way I get 9 servings instead of 8. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#Easy and quick!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#1#This was very good. I used regular lime gelatin, not sugar-free, since the sugar-free gelatins always take forever to dissolve completely. The pie was very tasty and looked cool and lovely. I brought it to a club meeting and it disappeared almost immediately!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#5#1#This was a disaster for me. The jello turned into little balls when I whisked in the yogurt. The only thing I can think of is that the yogurt was too cold and caused the jello to start to set. Maybe it would have worked if I had allowed the yogurt to warm up a bit first. I had to throw it away.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#2#0#You can make other flavors simply change out the gelatin and the yogurt...strawberry, peach, lemon, etc. I've been making this for many years. It is always a hit! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#2#0#Excellent! I made this using regular ingredients (no sugar-free or fat-free) and both hubby and I loved this pie. So easy and a great summer recipe! Next time I plan on using an Oreo cookie crust. I also plan on trying a lemon version of this pie.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#2#0#My husband just yelled out good pie . Guess that means I can make it again. Will try it in a different flavor, maybe orange in a chocolate graham cracker crust. Hmm, that sounds good. This is so quick and easy to prepare. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#Follow recipe as written, soooo good, quick and easy. MJAnderson
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Quick and easy.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#2#0#You DO NOT have to use the same flavor jello as the yogurt. I really like raspberry yogurt with peach jello, for example. I usually use an Oreo crust with most of my pies just because I like the look and taste; and I always add plenty of fruit. Most of the time I will also use a juice or flavored iced tea in place of the water, but that does bring up the sugar count. LOVE these pies!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#4#1#Great recipe ?? we used carb master yogurt to cut the carbs ? my daughter is a type 1 diabetic so we gotta watch those ?? anybody knocking this recipe or anything sugar free !!! Some people aren't as fortunate or have no choice with certain things ???? my daughter can still consume sugars etc and to be honest white bread would spike her more then a snicker bar lol contrary to belief... 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#So easy and delicious!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#4#0#I've made this many times with different flavors of jello and yogurt, even mixing and matching like orange jello and lemon yogurt. No one even knows it's made with sugar free or reduced fat/sugar products. If you want to reduce the sugar, there are low sugar yogurts out there, even without aspartame.The one thing I never done yet is put it in a pie crust; I never saw the appeal of it in a pie. The filling is great as it's own thing: a fluffy, cool, and flavorful dessert. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This recipe is so quick , easy & good.I have tried many flavor variationsraspberry yogurt & raspberry jellostrawberry yogurt & strawberry jelloIf you garnish it with fresh berries once it sets it looks really fancybut it is so quick & easy to makeIt tasted great in every flavor. Very light & fluffy YUM :o)In the future I am going to try coconut yogurt & pineapple jello .... Pina Colada Pie !
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#YUMMY- I made two pie's ,so simply and so good. I'm giving the other one to my sister in law for her family for Easter. Thank You, Lee-Ann Treacher 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#Very nice and very easy. Can also be modified using different flavors of jello & yogurt.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#2#0#I've made this pie twice, so easy to make and they came out flawless and scrumptious. My husband loves the recipe and so do I...this is a definite keeper and our families will be enjoying it in the future! I followed the recipe, but also added a little lime juice to increase the tang factor. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#I made this pie today and give it a huge thumbs up. My husband and I both loved this pie. So easy with only 4 ingredients. It makes a great last minute dessert. I highly recommend this pie as a field editor for Taste of Home.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#Well this was a big hit with hubby and I. Made it just as the recipe was printed. Would definitely make it again and again.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#This dessert was a fluffy little piece of lime heaven! I used regular jello and whipped topping as some other reviewers did. This would be a perfect dessert for a summer gathering. It just tastes like summer and is so easy!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#2#0#This is a good pie.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This recipe is at least 15 years old (nothing wrong with that), from Weight Watchers. It is very good, but I agree with the first reviewer. Not a fan of Cool Whip, and I'm not a fan of anything that is sugar free. There are some funky ingredients in both Cool Whip and the sugar free Jello. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I recently came across this recipe and I am so glad I did! This key lime pie is absolutely delicious and refreshing! I have made it 3 times, each time changing it up a little. For example, even though I use the ingredients it calls for... the first time I used 2 containers of light yogurt w/ some fresh lime juice, the second time I used 1 light yogurt and 1 regular yogurt and this third time I used 1 light and 1 regular yogurt and again added fresh squeezed lime juice. I tasted it before pouring it into the crust and it was DELICIOUS! Third times a charm! It's just now setting in the refrigerator but I think from now on I will be adding lime juice b/c it enhances the flavors and makes it a bit more tangy. Yum! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#Wonderful. I did make my own crust and used i/2 the sugar and 2 tsp. Stevia Sweetener. Yogurt. I used plain Greek Yogurt and put in 1/2 tsp. Vanilla, Stevia to taste and squeezed a fresh lime into it. It is to die for. I am making it a regular summer treat, Oh who am I kidding, year round treat.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#I've made this for my diabetic husband and sons and everyone loves it! I make it with low fat and sugar free ingredients. No one at our church pitch-in knew it was diet and low-fat! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Very light and fluffy. Next time I am going to add cream cheese.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Loved it! I did not have key lime jello, so I used unflavored gelatin and substituted lime juice for the water. The pie was awesome. This will be a repeat at our house!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#Yum, this pie reminds me of my childhood and eating ambrosia salad. I know our family and friends will enjoy it this year at Thanksgiving. I used a Pillsbury pie crust in place of the graham cracker crust. Thanks for sharing ;)
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#My husband--who doesn't usually like low-fat foods--LOVES this pie. I love it because it's delicious and super easy to make. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Delicious and so easy to make!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Very good & easy.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Absolutely Delicious! It was SO easy to make and turned out just perfect. DEFINITELY will make this over and over!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#Loved this pie recipe! My mom used to make a similar pie called Frosty Fruit. I added drained crushed pineapple and a half cup of pecan pieces to this recipe. My husband loved it!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Easy, easy, easy!!! Light and fluffy and taste great! What more could you ask for?
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This pie was very quick and easy to prepare. I'll definitely make this over and over again. Such a light lime taste. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#FYI: Use caution when you serve this to those who want SUGARFREE! This recipe isn't! Check ALL your ingredients' labels first before you serve this as SUGAR FREE! If you used the Yoplait Yogurt, as I did, there are 14g of sugar per serving, plus the Graham Cracker crust might have some! Mine will be for our dinner dessert TONIGHT!! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this for a get-together along with a couple of other pies. It was a hit! Everyone loved it. It's perfect for a light ending to a big meal. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#I prepare a dessert bar for the Fire Dept's monthly fundraising dinners and I always include a diabetic-friendly dessert. I will definitely try this recipe. Key lime pies go over well with our guests, so I know this key-lime-like substitute will make our sugar-conscious guests very happy. I can't wait to try it with other flavors, too. This sounds like a winner. Thanks! (star rating for all things about it; add'l star missing only because I haven't made it yet!) 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#It's a wonderful pie. If you don't want to make it (and miss out on a delicious, light dessert), simply because it doesn't use actual key limes, then don't make it. But if you do, you're in for a real treat!!! By the way, the color doesn't affect the taste. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#1#For those hung up on the color of this pie...Key lime pie really is not green unless food color is used..Key lime pie is a pale yellow green. I intend to make this soon...looks so good and inexpensive and light on the calories and fat. The other flavors people have mentioned sounds great too.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#2#0#I have been making for years. I'M diabetic and this is one of my go to desserts when i want something light. Super easy to make 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#First of all it is called Key Lime Pie because it is using key lime flavored yogurt. Secondly, you can make this pie with cherry jello and cherry yogurt or strawberry jello and strawberry yogurt or whatever compatible flavors you like. It is a delicious, light pie that everyone seems to enjoy whenever it is served.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#Actually key lime juice is yellow, not green and the limes themselves are more a yellow color. They're a lot different than regular limes. But that is neither here nor there, this is a very simple recipe for a nice treat, especially for diabetics. I've had this and it's tasty! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#Read the ingredients. Key lime yogurts. Enough said.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#The key lime pie I have ever had was GREEN...limes are not yellow!!! I have been making my grandmother's key lime pie for 40 yrs and love the GREEN look and taste. This one looks yummy...am going to try! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#4#0#Lighten up people - so its not the real thing - its still good!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#4#0#Great recipe, easier on glucose readings and delicious! Thanks for sharing with us. I don't care if it is green but for those who do ....don't make it! This so called sad imitation, as amateur cook called it, is better than most Key Lime' pies I have eaten in some of the finest restaurants that not so amateur pastry chefs made! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#2#15#I agree with pjmcbride. A key lime pie is NOT GREEN. Where is the key lime juice? What part of this pie even comes remotely close to a true key lime pie??????? I would NEVER, EVER, EVER make this sad imitation.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Will surely make this one!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#2#I love Key Lime Pie and don't eat it because of my diatbetes, so was very excited to see this easy recipe for a lime flavored pie. It was simple and very good. Still can't eat too much of it but it's a nice treat. I added some lime zest to it for extra flavor. Definitely make ahead of time so it has time to really firm up before serving. Giving it a 4 rating only because it isn't really key lime other than what is in the yogurt. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#13#AHHHHH! HOW CAN YOU EVEN CALL THIS KEY LIME PIE, NO KEY LIMES IN IT!KEY LIME PIE IS NOT GREEN...WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I've been making this for a long time and with various flavours - always goes down a treat :) 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Easy, quick and yummy - my favorite kind of recipe.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#It's a HIT! This is so easy, inexpensive and absolutely delicious. Made this 3 times this week it's so popular with friends. perfect light dessert for summertime! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#2#0#Light, low cal, and doesn't taste like it. Also is a Weight Watchers recipe. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#I have made this also with strawberry, adding sliced fresh strawberries, peach with sliced, well drained canned peaches, and with orange cream yogurt with well drained mandarin oranges - all are veryy light and fantastic!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I found this recipe in 2012 for St Pat's Day and have made a variety of flavors. This and all the variations have been big hits. The banana split one is the best-very well drained crushed pineapple, strawberry yogurt and jello with fresh strawberries chopped, some coconut too and small pieces of dark chocolate mixed with the cool whip is a great flavor too. Slice a banana on the bottom and pour all the rest on top in the graham cracker crust. Decorate with a few sliced strawberries and or coconut. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This is a very tasty dessert. I have made it for my diabetic sister , and my dieting self! it's really good, the only thing I did differently was I froze it instead of refridgerating it. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I added 1 tablespoon of lime juice to the recipe.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Very good and summer good.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Quick and easy. Very light.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Made this for my office for St. Patrick's Day. Everybody LOVED it. Am planning to make again to take in for Easter--one in peach and one in strawberry. Super yummy! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This was very light and easy to make. I make it for work on St Pat's Day 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Very easy to assemble! Am wondering if other flavors could be easily substituted as well (strawberry, raspberry); seems it would work as long as you have matching yogurt/jello's. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I do not like lime flavor typically. I love this recipe the sour lime taste blends so well with the sweet graham cracker. My family loves it as well. Cool, delicious and easy.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Very good recipe. My husband is a diabetic and he loves it!!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#SO easy, delicious, and light. LOVE IT!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this pie for my kids & they really liked it.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This was so great on a hot day. I did not put in a crust but in dessert cups. I have also made it in Peach and I plan on making Lemon and Raspberry. As long as the jello and yogurt match you can make any flavor. We love it.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This is delicious, quick, easy, and fun to make. My grandsons and I have made it several times this summer. We also decided to expand the idea. We have since made orange pie using orange yogurt and orange jello and lemon pie the same way. Next week we are going to try cherry. We think there is a lot a variety possible with these ingredients.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Very good. Also tried with strawberry yogurt/jello and orange creme yogurt/jello. These were a hit for summer.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I don't care if it's fake key lime! This was a hit with family and guests. Since it's so easy to make, I plan to keep the ingredients on hand to make it often. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I make this recipe for my dad who is diabetic and he loves it! You can also get cool whip in sugar free eliminating even more of the sugar. I've also tried it with different flavors of jello and yogurt and it works great! It also tastes great even if you aren't diabetic! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#this dessert is definitely simple- but it tastes exactly like what it is... just yogurt and coolwhip sweetened with jello mix.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I got this recipe from my mom awhile ago who makes it for my dad who is diabetic.It's so easy to make and so yummy, and it's not insanely loaded with sugars and calories like most other desserts. My boyfriends loves it too, so it's a nice treat for us. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This is an easy to make pie that is delicious and low in fat. The filling makes a little more than will fit in the crust, so I just get out a spoon and eat what's left in the bowl. I have made it several times and my family loves it. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This is a perfect summer recipe, especially if you use a ready-made crust, since there's absolutely no baking involved. I love citrus of any kind, but lime is my favourite. I can see that I'll be making this again and again over the summer. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I have made this recipe several times, twice for events I catered and also for my family. Everyone LOVES it. Its so quick and easy but people thing you really fussed.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#2#0#I have used different Jello flavors with matching yogurts on this one-peach is great! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I actually made this with berry jell-o and whipped strawberry yougurt. Everyone that ate it loved it! I can't wait to try this with another flavor. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#my son loves this pie and asks for it often .very easy and no as rich as the cooked. I use regular jello
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This was awesome. Light & fluffy and low calorie. I made it for work and even co-workers on a diet ate some.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this at Easter using lime juice instead of water for all my fussy eaters. Everyone LOVED it. My daughter has since made it using different flavors of jello, juice and yogurt and it continues to be a hit. A friend put the juice back on the heat after stirring in the jello. It quickly dissolved completely. I actually added a little lime zest to my pie for extra lime flavor. YUM!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I loved this. I used the Yoplait thick yogurt. I have also paired this with other flavors of yogurt and jello with the same great results.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this today for St Patricks Day. It is so refreshing, light and delicious.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This was great. The only thing is you can not get lime yogurt here, so I mixed rapsberry yogurt with the lime jello and it was a great combo.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#1#I love this recipe, I tried it with a raspberry gelatin, the chocolate and rasperry whips yogurt and added a few raspberries and it was delicious and still super easy.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#added 1-2 teaspoons lime juice to bring out the flavor. This is a light, delicious dessert to serve. I have made this dessert now three times this month!!!!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This is so good and EZ to make. I serve it to may grandchildren and they love it and it is good for them
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#this is a great pie. i have made it with several different jello's and yogurts. i really recommend this pie for diabetics and people wanting to lose weight 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Thanks for that tip----didn't think about that-as I'm sure other hadn't. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Now if there was just a way to convert to metric---Great Recipe---Thanks.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I LOVED THIS!!! I was so busy making food for our whole family that I didn't have time to worry about dessert until the very last minute. And this was perfect! Everyone loved it and they couldn't believe it when I told them how easy and fast it was to make. My brother hates key lime pie bc he thinks it's too rich and tart... he ended up taking some home bc he loved it. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#i have already made this 7 times everyone enjoys this very much
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#What a delicious taste and easy to make!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#loved this.I also used strawberry jello and strawberry yogart.It was great.the whole family liked it.I also made it without crust.It was just as good
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this for my husband who is a diabetic and took a piece to my mother. It was 3 days old and she loved it!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This recipe is a favorite in all flavors. I have been making it for years, now I seldom put into a pie crust, therefore saving even more calories. Norma
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This was easy to make and made a hit at our party on Sat. I also like that you can change the flavor.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this last week-it was wonderful! My only mistake was to put the jello and hot water into a metal bowl. For some reason it did not dissolve well and when I added the yogurt it globbed up. But it still tasted fantastic! I am sure lemon or strawberry would also be great!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this wonderful pie with an Oreo crust---WOW This easy and tasty pie is a definite keeper. Will try different flavors and colors for special day.....C
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this and took it into work. Everyone loved it. It was light, creamy, delicious and low fat. Carol
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this pie for a family St. Patrick's Day celebration. It was quick and easy to make and everyone enjoyed it! I used the extra large sized crust and it was still nice and full. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Delicious, light and easy to make. I made mine with peach jello and peach yogurt and served it with a dollop of whipped cream. Would be great made with any flavor!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#My fiance and I really enjoyed this dessert. It was so easy and very delicious too. We will be making it again and passing the recipe onto other family and friends!.. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#I prepared this pie for my family. It was easy (and quick) to prepare! Everyone loved it and it had a richer taste than the usual cool whip pie. Yogurt added was a simple way to add calcium to diet too!MWParsons 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made two of them for an office potluck on St. Patrick's Day. I had to leave before the luncheon started. I was told they were wonderful! I've been thinking of all the flavor combinations of gelatin and yogurt you could make into a pie. Thanks. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I tried this pie last night. I was a huge hit. I did, however, use an Oreo crust. Looked pretty and tasted wonderful. Everyone liked it and the people with health problems were not afraid to eat a big piece! It is so easy and hits the spot after a big meal. This recipe is a definite keeper!! lilbit2
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I only had one lime yogurt and one lemon yogurt...made it anyway and it was delish!! Made it for a St Patty Day treat and what a yummy treat it was.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#A super recipe. Hubby loved it. However, even though I heated both the mixing bowl and the measuring cup, the boiling water did not dissolve all of the lime gelatin. Think I will dissolve the gelatin in a small sauce pan next time and then pour it into the mixinf bowl.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this for our St Patty's potluck and no one even knew it was sugar free and low fat. I had 3 people ask for the recipe. I may try a different flavor next time. Peach sounds really good to me. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Why is it called key lime ? 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this pie for St Patrick's Day. As lime is not my favorite, I will make it only for special occasions like St. Patrick's Day, but it was quick and easy. However, I found that all the jello did not get completely'folded in' as there were a few chewy pieces of the jello spread throughout the pie. I also found that the crust apparently absorbed some liquid from the filling as it was a little softer than I would have liked. Maybe that was because I used Dream Whip instead of Cool Whip which I did not have on hand and no time to go out and purchase some. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This recipe came just in time for Irish Night at my church. I was responsible for desert for 80-and this fit the bill perfectly. I doubled the recipe and put it on a graham cracker crust in a 9x13 pan. I made 6 of them and there was one piece left over. It was hit with everyone who attended the event. Easy to make and very tasty. Oh, I drizzled Hershey's chocolate sauce over the top just to dress it up a bit. Wish I had taken a picture. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This is so easy to put together. I have made 3 pies for various occasions within a week's time and have received compliments each time! It was a great St Patrick's Day treat! Thanks for a sweet, light way to end a filling meal! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#We made this on vacation. Everyone loved it! I changed the flavors around and made four different pies: lemon, strawberry, orange and berry. They were all very good. The men like the lemon and key lime the best. They didn't even know it was a healthy dessert..hehe. I have been recommending this to everyone! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#i made this key lime pie on st pattys day.i thought i would try making the gelatin with lime juice. it was a hit,i myself that it was too sour,but guests overruled me....
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#1#No, I have not tried the pie yet, but I do plan to do so soon.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#this was really good. I am wanting to try it with strawberry instead of key lime.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I AM DIETING (WW'S) AND THIS DESSERT WAS IDEAL. EASY AND VERY GOOD. WILL DO AGAIN SOON. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This is a great pie. The first time I made it though, I did not wait for the gelatin to disolve enough. I got great reviews though on my Key Lime Flop . haha 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This recipe is great. I've made it many times for guests. I also like to make it using strawberry jello and yogurt. Also I thought using peach jello and yogurt would be great in the summer when fresh peaches are in season. I've given the recipe to my sister-in-law. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Delicious,lowfat dessert! Quick and easy to make. What's not to like?!? 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Getting the jello to dissolve in the hot water was a bit difficult.The church ladies said it was delicious, and so did my husband.46041
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This pie is so yummy. I got the recipe several years ago from Weight Watchers. I make it quite often.donna
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#The taste was outstanding but it didn t set that well so I tried it again with two boxes of jello and two-thirds of boiling water for the two. The second time I used a different flavor which was with two boxes of raspberry jello and two cartons of raspberry yogurt. After setting I sliced and froze it. What a wonderful summer frozen treat 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This pie was delicious! I made it for a friend for her birthday and she loved it too. Very light and refreshing.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Warm bowl should be used for Jello and hot water mix; with cold bowl, Jello does not dissolve as hot water'cools off' too quickly! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This recipe is very easy and very delicious. We also made a raspberry pie but changing the flavor of the jello and flavor of yogurt. Anybody can do this one.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This pie was so easy to make and really good. Next time I will make it with orange jello and orange yogurt. You can use any flavor of jello and yougurt.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#The same rubbery pieces happened when I made the pie. I used Black Cherry jello (my husband's favorite) and cherry vanilla yogurt. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Made this pie and brought into office. Went over really well. This is so easy to make and so tasty. I made a Raspberry the next day and I want to make it in strawberry next time using strawberry cool whip.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Hubby and I really liked this Key Lime pie. Easy to make. Only thing wrong is for some reason I had tiny pieces of rubbery lime jello in the pie even though I mixed it really good. Any help with that?
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this with a chocolate crumb crusr & it was a big hit. Fast, easy & delicious!jab
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Made this on 3/15/09. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this dessert. Will make it again using other flavors
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#My pies set up very well. I tried it with no-sugar red raspberry jello and reduced fat raspberry yogurt. It disappeared as fast as the key-lime pie.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This pie is great!! Can be frozen, so I make 2 at a time. If you use no sugar yogurt and cool whip, you have a delicious dessert a with LOW, LOW calorie count.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#My husband and I loved the taste of the pie but the texture was very runny. Even after refridgerating overnight - it was still soupy and did not hold up when cut. It didn't keep us from grabbing a spoon and devouring it though..... 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this to go with our St.Paddy's Day supper. Great hit loved by all. The cool lime flavor would go great on a hot summer day. Very easy and Quick to make. Could easiely be made in several flavors by changing the Jello and yogurt flavors. Will make again often Thanx 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I love this recipe. I made my own graham cracker crust--better than store bought & easy to throw together. You can definitely pick out the gelatin flavor you like and match a yogurt to it for peach, strawberry, or any flavor you like! Most of the ingredients I had on hand.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This was quick and easy to make anc very tasty. It would be good with any matching jello and yogurt flavor. Yummy. My next one will be raspberry.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made two of these pies last saturday for a lunch gathering. I needed something quick. Well this was just what I needed. It is really great. Everyone loved it. I made another one later but changed it all to peach. My next one will be strawberry.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This pie was so simple to make and tastes so delicious. The next time I make it, I will try using a different flavor of jello and yogurt.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made the Key Lime Pie for my family last weekend and the orders were please make it again soon! My daughter made one using strawberry jello and strawberry yogurt and it was delicious.This recipe will be used many times !
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this pie for St. Patrick's Day and it was a big hit! For an added touch, I served it with green candied maraschino cherries and green sprinkles. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Oh my gosh it was so quick and easy and tasted like I had slaved over it for hours. I took it to a potluck and everyone loved it.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Made it for St. Patrick's dessert with the pretty green color. Added a few slices of lime on top for color and hint of the flavor to come. Easy, quick, low calorie and yummy! A hit with our family. Will make it again, especially for the summertime. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I tried this recipe and my husband Johnny says its a keeper. That is how I know he likes the recipes I try. So far almost every recipe I have tried from all your magazines have been keepers with him. That should tell you how great your recipes are. Keep up the good work.Lou White, Leesburg, Fl.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I put the pie in the freezer. Add a little whipped topping and it is delicious served frozen.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I used regular jello the other day in mine and had no problem.  Maybe too much water?
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this dessert for St. Patrick's Day. I give it an A+. I did, however, get the same recipe off the Keebler Graham Cracker Pie Crust package. I'm going to try it with some other flavors this summer. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this pie with peach gelatin and peach yogurt as my husband loves anything peach flavored. I added some sliced peaches too, and it turned out to be so delicious! It is a wonderful light dessert.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This was so easy to make and a wonderful light refreshing low-cal dessert. There was no tartness like a regular Key Lime Pie and my whole family, grandkids to grandpa enjoyed it. Jodi C
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This was so good and so easy. You could easily switch the jello and yogurt flavors to make the pie different.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This is so easy and fast to make. I will try it with other flavors too.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#AWESOME!!!! Finally found a key lime pie my husband loves. THANKS.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this pie, boiled the gelatin, but wound up having tidbits of gelatin, did not mix well with the yogurt, but it does need a tad bit more of lime juice. I like that it was light and airy. Will make again, but try to boil the gelatin longer maybe.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This recipe was extremely easy to make and very tasty. I used a chocolate crust instead of a graham cracker crust. I will make this again and try it with different gelatins and yogurts. Strawberry sounds good with fresh strawberries layered in the bottom.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this Key Lime Pie and it lacked some things. Wish I had added some lime juice to it and maybe cream cheese or something. It just did not have the tangy taste I like in lemon pies.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Was a bit too fluffy--I prefer a more substantial pie. But the taste was good.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made this for our Bible Study adult group and used 1 carton of cheesecake yogart and one vanila, then added 1 tbl. key lime juice. it was wonderful and everyone loved it. Shared the receipe with all present.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL AND EASY. YUMHO
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Very refreshing and so easy! You can make this with different flavors. Next time I'll try strawberry. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I have been making this for several years. I also make it with strawberry.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This pie was so easy to make and delicious. My family and I loved it. It is so light and you feel good about going back for seconds. Thanks for sharing
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I loved it. I am going to make two for a spaghetti fund raiser for the youth at our church. Everyone that had a piece of the pie loved it. My husbgand isn't into yogurt, low fat, etc. He gave it a thumbs up. Thank you, Helen 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This was great..and you don't feel terrible getting another piece! I plan on making it again with other flavors. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I made the orange Dreamsicle version and it was great. Will definitely make this again.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#1#0#I made this over the weekend. My husband and I are both diabetic so I used SF jello and SF whipped topping. I didn't put it in a crust....I just crushed several graham crackers and spread them on the bottom of pie pan and then poured the topping on. It was great! Re: the comment about the pie not setting up; I wonder if she put too much water in it. You don't put the two cups like the jello box instructs....this recipe only calls for 1/4 cup. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#HELP! I tried this recipe yesterday and it did not set up. It had plenty of frig time. Any suggestions would be great - the family loved it anyway. Only change was used regular jello as I did not have sugar free on hand.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Weight Watchers has put this recipe in their handouts for years. I have made it many times & it has always gone over well. You can make it it in many flavors- try using peach yogurt & jello.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#Re: Fluffy Key Lime PieI also agree, excellent recipe have also tried several different flavors. Our favorite is still the Key Lime. Have also done the recipe without the graham cracker crust.Barb C
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I have made this pie for a couple of years and it is oh so fast and easy. I have taken it losts of places and everyone likes it so I share the recipe lots. Rena
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This is a great recipe - very easy and oh so good. I've experimented with other flavors of jello and yogurt and have had wonderful results. (strawberry jello and strawberry yogurt, lemon, orange, etc.) 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#THIS RECIPE IS WONDERFUL, LOVE LOVE LOVE.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I always use chocolate crumbs for the crust and a little sprinkly on top. Instead of Cool Whip I find Carnation milk healthier. You freeze the milk until crystals are forming along the sides and then you whip it.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I have made this with strawberry jello & yogurt, lemon jello & yogurt,orange jello & yogurt,raspberry jello & yogurt and peach jello & yogurt & they are all delicious!!!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I use only sugar free Cool Whip! It doesn't taste any different to my husband & I. I am thrilled we have it available as he is a diabetic! 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I am also a diabetic and this pie sounds wonderful! They do make sugar free cool whip in the frozen aisle, too, which would bring the sugar content down even more.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I make this every year for Easter. I make 3-4 pies using different yogurt & jello combinations. They look so pretty on the dessert table.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This sounds wonderful. Since I am a diabetic, I am always looking for something yummy. I love Key Lime, can't wait to try this. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I have made this also and instead of the boiling water I use boiling lime juice.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I have made this recipe in the past it is the best and easiest keylime pie recipe ever. I have tried lots of keylime pie but nothing comes close to this one!
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I've done a variation on this - just jello and key lime yoghurt, but this looks even yummier, and will be on my must-make list for summer desserts. Thanks. 
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#To use real key limes, add them to yogert, and to juice them use a garlic press. Works great. Donita Lindamood
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This recipe is so easy and delicious. I also have used different varieties of jello/yogurts. Key Lime is my favorite, but I like the orange dreamcycle also. This dessest is so lite, you always have room for it.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#I make this pie all the time and it is wonderful. It is low in calories, sugar and fat so is a good snack for those of us that have to watch our weight. Try different jellos and yogurts. Black cherry is especially yummy!lkkboyd
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#For a true Key Lime flavor, use 1/4 cp. of fresh Key Lime juice in place of the water.
Fluffy Key Lime Pie#0#0#This is easy as Pie and I have tried it with lemon jello and lemon yogurt. It's light as a cloud and oh so yummy!! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Fixed this last night for my weekly dinner with my grandsons. There was not a drop of it left it was that good.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#3#1#I made this tonight and it couldn't have been easier PLUS it was really delicious. This is a keeper! *As I write this review, my husband is getting himself seconds.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#14#0#Hello from Clarion PA, Krista in Meadville! She probably has nothing to do with the actual post and just a blurb about the restaurant. Let alone the comments section, and will never see this ?? I am going to hope she does see it !! ?? This turned out great! I did a few swap outs, because teenager ???? I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced. I 100% recommend putting soup over your rice, or grain of choice. I have made a few different versions over the years and found out (I'd say kind of the hard way) the first time I made it to separate the grain and soup! You really can't store or re-heat it well with it added in during cooking. I got gloop instead of soup the next day! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#6#3#Love this recipe! Even my husband loves it and he does not like rice. This one is a keeper.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#8#0#Just made and it is yummy. The brown sugar must be one of ingredients that makes it so tasty.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#3#1#This delicious soup like so many other reviewers have said will now be in the dinner rotation. Even my extremely picky husband enjoyed it.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#21#3#LOVE this recipe, it's my go too. My Taste of Home recipe is from 2012 and calls for 2 quarts of water. I substitute 6 cups of beef stock, we like a thicker soup. A few other tweaks, I use 1/4 cup of uncooked rice and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. This soup never stays very long in the refrigerator...if it makes it that far. You won't go wrong with this recipe! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#45#5#Made this for the second time today - followed the original recipe the first time - and then today incorporated ideas from some of the reviews and we liked it much better. Instead of 6 cups of water, I used 4 cups of beef cooking stock and 2 cups of water. Also added 3/4 cup of onions with the beef, and 3/4 cup of celery and couple teaspoons of garlic when adding the tomato sauce, etc. Lastly, I added 1 TBSP worcestershire sauce for flavor and the result was great.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#26#0#Sounds delicious. Could this be frozen?
Stuffed Pepper Soup#16#6#I really liked this soup. I found it interesting that the rice needs to be cooked beforehand and can't cook in the broth while the soup simmers for 30 min. But followed the recipe as-written and give this five stars. Was a bit sweeter than expected so next time I might decrease the amount of brown sugar.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#28#4#I used 3 cups of chopped green peppers plus 2 red bell peppers. Served it with cornbread. Outstanding recipe! This is one of those dishes that tastes even better the next day. Guess what I'm having for dinner tonight :-&gt; 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#21#0#This was great. Added some stuff- lots of garlic, 2 onions, a dash of Worcestershire, 3 jalapenos diced. With a house full of extremely picky eaters they all loved this soup. I think it's a first for me. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#16#3#I do a lot of cooking and have been making this since I first saw it in TOH years ago. It is my absolute favorite soup in my large repertoire. People that tell my they hate bell peppers ask me for this soup when we get together. I use green, red, and yellow pepperswhatever I have on hand. I do add a little garlic and Worcestershire, but it's fine without it. Very hearty, healthy, and comforting.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#22#4#This recipe is great but to make it better I used half beef half bulk sausage; I also added one onion medium size for a single recipe, or a large for a double recipe. I used all beef broth instead of water and bouillon. And, if you are a garlic fanatic like me, then add a couple of tablespoons of garlic, you can start out with less and add more if you would like. Last but not least if you feel that you still don't have enough flavor use about a tablespoon or so of onion soup mix, that definitely secured the flavor for me, Ok that's all...just my little tweaks. Oh, and you must serve this soup with homemade bread topped with Land O' Lakes Olive Oil and Sea Salt butter spread. DELISH!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#8#1#Use leftover meatloaf, it's really tasty! The recipe needs salt, about 1/2 tsp. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#19#9#This recipe gave me a starting point - I had a bunch of peppers of many kinds, chopped em up. Used ground turkey I had on hand plus a can of Ro-Tel and another of diced tomatoes, threw in some Clamato juice. Pretty tasty but I didn't think it went very well with rice, which I kept on the side so I can freeze the soup leftovers. WHen I that it out out I may add chili powder and beans, as it's a good base recipe for chili.... Overall pretty tasty.... 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#3#0#Great recipe. Love changing the peppers when local produce is in season. Very tasty and the smell is great. Thanks
Stuffed Pepper Soup#1#0#This soup is so good!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#2#0#next time I would use a little more spices. I only had half the tomato sauce,so added 15oz. of tomato with green chilles . I also added tbs of worcestershire , minced onions and garlic. I would also add celery
Stuffed Pepper Soup#2#1#Tasty mistake we loved. I made 1/2 batch for the 2 of us and accidently used diced tomatoes and green chilies 14.5 oz can in my pantry right next to diced tomatoes on shelf. It gave it just a little more kick . I didn't add salt and I stir fried about 1/2 cup of chopped onions with the ground beef. It was delicious and my husband really liked it. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#7#0#I have made this soup 6 or 7 times. It is so good! I have also taught a couple of people how to make it since they loved it when they had it at my house. I also used beef broth rather than bouillon and water, and also added onion and garlic. We also use 2 green peppers and 1 red pepper. This is a recipe I'll use for years to come!!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#2#1#This soup is absolutely amazing! My kids thought it tasted like tacos and enjoyed topping the soup with shredded cheese, sour cream and crumbled tortilla chips for a fun, fiesta kind of feel!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#2#1#I'm not a big fan of stuffed peppers but i love this soup! I make it with ground chicken or turkey, brown rice and add more chopped peppers. Delicious! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#2#1#One of the best soups ever. I didn't use beef bullion but used 1 litre of beef broth and 2 cups of water. Also as others have said, added an onion, chopped celery, garlic, a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and a few dashes of hot sauce. If your kids don't like diced tomatoes, omit them and add an extra can of tomato sauce.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#1#Best stuffed pepper soup I have ever had. Only change I made was adding 4 cups of cooked rice instead of 2.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Delicious!! Will make again!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#2#0#This soup is yummy and the hubby loved it too! I added a large onion, two cloves of garlic and a few splashes of worchesire sauce. I did not put rice in it. Will definitely make it again!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#1#0#Soooooo yummy!!!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#1#0#My family enjoyed this
Stuffed Pepper Soup#2#2#We had an abundance of tomatoes and green peppers in out summer garden so I was able to those fo the diced tomatoes and green pepper. I did not use cooked rice but since the soup was simmering I let the rice cook in the soup. Everyone loved it.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#2#0#Beth, use the vegan ground meat substitute from the frozen food section of your market. You honestly can't tell the difference. I also use vegetable stock instead of beef stock or boullion when I make this for my boyfriend's daughter who is vegan. This tip also works for chili too.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#1#0#I don't eat red meat or pork. Is there anything I can use to substitute for the beef? 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#My whole family loves this soup! Easy to put together and the ingredients are probably staples in many kitchens. Hearty and flavorful, great for a cold winter day or a rainy day. Although we didn't make any changes initially, since we dont like tomatoes, we decided to try substituting 15oz of tomato sauce for the 28oz can of undrained diced tomatoes. Wonderful! Most people will probably enjoy the recipe just as orginally submitted and it is wonderful. Thank you for sharing the recipe. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#3#1#I've made it with and without brown sugar and it's much better without the sugar in my family's opinion.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#2#0#This is delicious! And even better reheated! Another keeper! I love making homemade soup that's quick and easy and tasty enough for after work preparation. This one fits the bill! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#really good soup. kids don't like green peppers or tomatoes-use red peppers and run tomatoes through the blender. use better than bullion in place of water and a dash of worcestershire sauce 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I don't often rave over my own cooking, but this soup is amazing. I added a large white onion, marjoram, and sage; reduced the simmer time to 30 total so the veggies stayed crisp. Best soup ever!!!!!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This is a keeper! Made as written except I reduced the sodium using lower sodium tomatoes, tomato sauce and bullion. Very easy to put together and was excellent!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#1#0#Another go to recipe for me. I've made this a number of times, but do not use the rice in the actual soup, since it gets mushy for leftovers, and I love them! Instead, I just serve the rice separately so each can take the amount they want. I learned this from mother--in-law, who served her chili this way. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#2#0#Love this soup! Modifications: used no salt added beef stock instead of water and bouillon cubes, added chopped onion, used ground turkey (99% lean) and added 1 T worcestershire sauce. I will freeze this soup (without rice). My recipe makes 10 servings (uses 1/2 c cooked rice per serving). We are following WW and this equals 4 points.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Absolutely delicious! My husband made this soup for dinner, but without the rice for we're on the keto diet. It's a comeback to recipe!. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Have been trying new recipes, found this to be in top 3. Easy, ingredients always in pantry, one pot wonder. Everyone would place rice in bowls first, then sauce over. Left over rice will be used in another recipe. Nothing goes to waste... mmmm mmmm delish!!!!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This soup was delicious. I only used 1 lb of hamburger but that was plenty for us. I did have a lot leftover, so next time I'll add the rice to each bowl and not to the entire pan of soup. It soaked it up and was no longer soup the next day. It was easy enough to thin out with more stock, but the rice got a little mushy. Still good and none went to waste! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This recipe was great! It was quick and easy, using ingredients that a lot of people have on hand. I cut the recipe in half and it still made a ton! I would make this again. I added some grated Parmesan cheese to mine.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#1#1#Wonderful recipe!! I left off the brown sugar (I am diabetic) and added a half an onion, diced, and about a 1/4 cup celery which are two additional ingredients that I include in my stuffed peppers. I cooked it in my crockpot on low for 8 hours. I will definitely make this again!!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This soup is delicious! I browned the ground beef and then threw everything but the rice into a crockpot & cooked on low for 6 hours. During the last 1 1\2 hours I added the cooked rice to the crockpot. I had roasted red peppers so I used 1 cup of those & 1 cup green peppers. Leftovers are great too even though it is thicker.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#1#0#Very easy and delicious! I doubled the green peppers and added onion, garlic, and a little cayenne pepper. I didn't add the rice to the soup, but put a little rice in the bowls and ladled the soup over the top. I served it with some delicious crusty bread. My husband and I both loved it. This recipe is a keeper!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#1#0#This recipe has been so popular. So many great reviews. I am happy to finally be adding mine. I can't add much more then what has already been spoken for. It's a greet good, satisfying soup. One that really matures overnight.It has the perfect name, it does taste like a stuffed pepper! Due to some diet restrictions I made the following changes. No brown sugar or tomato sauce. I used 1 very large fresh tomato. I used a packet of beefy onion soup mix and added some Better Than Boullion Beef base to the mix. I upped the amount of green pepper and used less ground beef. And I used no rice.This is all about the beefy taste wrapped around Green Peppers.It was most enjoyable.TOH-VFE
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This recipe is excellent! My family loved it! My husband, who is not big on ground meat, would have liked a bit less but did love the taste. It is very hearty and great with a salad and crusty rolls.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#1#1#Amazing! Growing up....stuffed green peppers were my favorite! I did NOT (wish I had) know there was such a thing as GREEN PEPPER SOUP until I was at an upscale restaurant a few months ago and it was one of my choices for soup. I tried it and was blown away how good it was... it reminded me of my mom's! That night when I got home....I searched online to find this v recipe. I had all the ingredients.... so the next day I made it and now it is a monthly dinner plus enough for MY lunch the next day! I did add a few splashes of .... worcestershire because that was something I remember my mom putting in her stuffed peppers & with my eyes closed it was liked eating my mom's stuffed peppers! Amazing!!! To put a slice of American cheese on top of each bowl..... will blow your mind.... makes it creamy and delicious! I am a picky eater.... so to find this recipe is the BEST! To make it thicker add a little more cooked rice other than that ENJOY! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#We loved this soup! I made only 1/2 of the recipe to make sure that it would be one that I truly like. Like others, I added the white rice to each bowl first, then topped it with the soup and mixed it in. I wanted to avoid the common complaint that the rice expanded and got gummy as it sat in the refrigerator. The only change I would make is add more green pepper and reduce the amount of fluid. I cooked this on the stove for a couple of hours, adding fluid as needed. I used beef broth and a bit of water, and only 1 beef bouillon cube.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#So easy....so good!!!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#1#0#Tasty, but way too sweet. Cut the brown sugar by at least half.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This soup is a Christmas Eve tradition in my family! I use a 32 oz. carton of beef broth instead of boullion & water, and a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce & diced tomatoes (since hubby doesn't like tomato chunks). I also use instant brown rice & add it during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Hearty & delicious! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#So good! I used 1 pound each of ground beef and turkey and added some sliced cabbage too. Definitely a keeper!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Absolutely the best soup recipe, a definite keeper.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This soup is awesome. My husband raves about it, and we especially enjoy it with corn chips.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This classic comeback was republished in the Sept/Oct 2017 issue, where I saw it for the first time. I just happened to have made stuffed green peppers the day before, had two leftover, so I combined this recipe with my leftovers, and it was terrific. Now, I may just make the soup and skip the stuffed green pepper altogether. Wonderful. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Very good. Hardy and quicksand essy. I'll use it again. Five stars.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#4#2#Please dont rate recipes if you dont follow the recipe directions. Make as is and rate it, otherwise there is no point to it.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#My husband begs me to make this AWESOME soup. I did use no salt added tomatoes and sauce and I cut the water to 5 cups andthe second time 5 1/2. If there is any left over from the first making, I put 2 cups in a quart freezer bag for when my husband begs again!Jim's wife Sharon! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This recipe was delicious! I used fresh peppers and tomatoes from my garden. I emptied the 28oz can of tomato sauce and used that to measure my own diced tomatoes. I also used about 1 cup more of cooked rice which made it a little thicker but it was still soup. Since there's just two of us, the recipe made enough for me to freeze two more dinners. Great for a cold fall or winter day for sure!!! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#A new fave! Made recipe as is except substituted ground chicken for the beef. Great the next day, too.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I made this for the 1st time and definitely NOT the last time! This soup is AMAZING! I doubled it because I share it with family and friends. I added fresh chopped garlic and chopped onion. I also added 2 envelopes of Goya seasoning. We slurped it up with some Garlic toast and couldn't stop raving about it as we ate it! What a perfect soup for Fall and a cold day! I will definitely be making this in the winter too! Thank you Taste of Home for a most EXCELLENT recipe!!! =) 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#For those of you who do not want to add brown sugar to the soup, try a can of stewed tomatoes. The sweetness in that type of product should be just right!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Delicious as written. Tastes just like stuffed peppers but much easier to make.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This soup was excellent. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added chopped onion and garlic. I didn't have a 28 ounce can of tomato sauce so I used a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. Six cups of water did not make it too thin. I measured out 1 quart of the soup without rice into a saucepan and added 1/2 cup of cooked rice for our meal. The recipe says it yields 2 quarts, but I got 3 additional quarts without rice to freeze. I will add 1/2 cup of cooked rice to each quart when I prepare it so the rice doesn't get mushy. This will be a regular go-to for our Wednesday Soup Night! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This soup is awesome, I make soups and desserts at a local supper club, and I love making this soup, I tweak it a bit to my taste, and added a few other ingredients. Definitely a 5 star recipe!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#1#I pulled this recipe out of the recent Taste of Home magazine. I was looking for a quick meal to make and I had all the ingredients on hand, with some swap outs. I used ground turkey instead of beef. Sauteed a half an onion with it. I thought that 6 C of water would be too much, so I cut back to 4 C and used 1 whole low sodium beef bouillon cube. For the diced tomatoes, I used (2) 14.5 oz cans and partially drained them before dumping in the pot. I only used about 2 tbsp of the brown sugar and no additional salt. Instead of rice, I served it on top of'cauliflower rice.' It was a hit. I'm giving this a 5 because the flavors are amazing and I'm betting will taste even better tomorrow! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This is excellent. Easy quick and l'm sure it will be even more flavourful tomorrow. Great make ahead dish. I could not bring myself to put sugar in so I didn't. I used home canned tomatoes so 2 32 oz. jars. I mostly cooked the rice then let it sit and cool awhile so it would not turn to mush and must admit l remembered wrong and added 3 cups of rice. Also l put a dollop of sour cream on each bowl before the garnish. Great recipe. Janet. VFE 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#1#0#We loved this. Didn't change a thing, also made great leftovers. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This tastes delicious!! I make it often and everyone who tries it says it has great flavor. It reminds my of my mom's Spanish rice from when I was growing up! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This was fantastic. I did add some garlic and chopped onion. Everyone loved it. Defiantly a keeper.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Loved it,added onion ,2 more cups water,bullion,1 more pepper.Will be one of my go to meals!!!! So easy
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I made this recipe incorporating some changes recommended by other reviewers: We are just two unless our grown children come, so we halved the recipe except for the rice and green peppers. Added onion & garlic and sauteed them with the green pepper & ground meat. Used beef broth instead of water. Added the rice right at the end. Despite the changes I am giving this 5* as the end result is so delicious and it is so easy to make. We loved it and the leftovers as well.Next time, I will try it without brown sugar and adding some smoked paprika for a little spicier taste.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#1#Way too much water!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This is a winner with my family and our boys' college roommates. I added 1 onion, a jalape?o, 4 cloves garlic, 2 grated carrots, & 1 quart water with beef base because I cook the rice separately. It freezes better that way, too. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I took this to an annual soup and salad lunch my ladies group has every January and it was a hit. I only made slight changes as the recipe is written here. I added a small chopped onion as I was browning the meat, reduced the brown sugar to 2 tablespoons and added one quart of beef broth instead of 2 quarts water and the beef bouillon. Everything else was the same as the recipe written here. I say that because the recipe published in the magazine in 1996 did not call for any water at all. Why does the website recipe say to add 2quarts of water? Did the restaurant notify the magazine after it came out that they had forgotten to include it in their recipe when they sent it in? Or did the TOH test kitchen add it? If so, why? I'm not complaining, just wondering. Anyway, I will be definitely make this again! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I always follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it, then make my own changes. Here is what I changed. It was too watery with 2 quarts of water. So I used no water and a 46 oz. Bottle of V-8. Also instead of all that rice I used half rice and half quinoa. Instead of beef bouillon granules I used roasted beef base. Absolutely delicious!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Soup needs onions and I won't be using brown sugar. As for the rice. I always cook it, or pasta in a separate pot as was suggested to me by a friend who is a chef. When you are ready to serve put rice, or pasta, in the bottom of bowl and ladle soup over the top. No gross, soggy rice or pasta ever again! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This was wonderful! I also halved the recipe as there are only two of us. I omitted the brown sugar and added chopped onion as one of the reviewers suggested. I'll definitely make again. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Make sure you stir occasionally, as I didn't and some of the rice stuck to the bottom of the pan. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#1#This recipe is DELICIOUS! I'd prepared it 11-13-15! This was my adaptation of the recipe: one can (8-oz.) sliced mushrooms, drained, one can (14-oz.) Italian diced tomatoes, undrained, 2 cups instant BROWN rice, cooked, 1 large green pepper, chopped, 1 medium onion, finely chopped, 1 beef bouillon cube, 1 cup water, 1 lb. ground turkey, cooked, 1 to 1-1/2 tsp. salt for taste, 1/2 to 1 tsp. pepper for taste, 1 cup Marinara sauce. This soup tasted just like stuffed peppers, too! It is definitely a keeper recipe! delowenstein 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I made this exactly as the recipe calls, and it made a TON of soup. It was delicious!! I will definitely make this again, although next time I will half the recipe, or reduce the amount of liquids. I didn't have a problem with mushy rice at all. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Easy to make and tastes great.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I did not use the brown sugar but added 1 whole onion chopped and 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of garlic powder. I also only added 1 quart of water for a thicker soup. This is awesome!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Delicious! Like others said, I added diced onion to the ground beef. Since we like thicker soup, I started out with two cups of water with the option of adding more, but it ended up being more than enough--I let it cook down once I removed the lid. I used white minute rice and added it in once the soup was done, rather than letting it cook the entire time. Also, I only added one tablespoon of brown sugar Splenda blend and skipped salt since the beef bouillon made it plenty salty.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This soup was delicious the first time it was served. However, the rice soaked in a lot of the liquid so the second time I served it, the taste was great, but the texture was mushy. I will definitely make it again but won't plan on leftovers. As other reviewers suggested, I added chopped onions. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Great soup to kick off the cold weather today! My changes were, I added 1/2 cup finely chopped onion while browning meat. Then I simmered the peppers alone in olive oil for 10 mins with some basil, oregano, and the salt & pepper. Used 3/4 cup brown sugar, only 1 beef cube & added 1 can of chicken broth. Made extra rice for those who like less hearty fare :)
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This soup was very very good
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#always wanted this recipe easy fast and delicious thanks
Stuffed Pepper Soup#1#0#Very Yummy!! My Husband & My Parents really loved it! (and my Dad is very picky nowadays) I used 2 pounds of meatloaf mix meat instead of only ground beef, cause beef is just so expensive, and it was wonderful! I also kicked up the spices a little with Montreal Steak Seasoning when browning meat and a little crushed red pepper. So Good!! And those of us who wanted added a little Texas Pete to soup when we ate (with grilled cheeses). Had plenty to freeze, too! Even better reheated!! Will be making A LOT!!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This was very easy! I used fresh tomatoes and beef broth instead of can tomatoes and the bouillon. It felt like maybe something was missing for our tastes so I added garlic and cayenne pepper. It was the little extra something we liked in our soup to take it to the next level. I will definitely be making it again!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Super easy and tastes delicious!!!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Ohh my gosh, so yummy and easy! made tonight for dinner..
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Oh my gosh....this is a terrific dump and cook soup! We enjoy this soup each and every time I make it......even for company!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This will easily become one of my favorite soup recipes. It tastes just like stuffed peppers and oh so easy to make. Not sure why the recipe says that it makes only 2 1/2 quarts. I cut the recipe in half, and still had 10 cups of soup.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I gave the recipe 5 stars but none of them showed up. :o(
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I gave the recipe 5 stars but none of them showed up. :o(
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#My husband and I loved this! I have to say I went through my cabinets and used random cans of tomatoes and sauce. One can of tomatoes was garlic, the other was with onions and green peppers. One of my tomato sauces was Italian and the other was plain. I also did the Minute rice in the last 10 or 15 minutes. Mine turned out more like stuffed peppers without taking all of the time of boiling and baking. I will definitely make this again! Thank you!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Delish!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Great recipe, but I did make a couple changes. Substituted lg. carton of beef broth for one of the two quarts of water; added a cup of chopped onion; and substituted crushed tomatoes for the tomato sauce. Also, simmered it 60-70 min.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#1#0#Excellent recipe. I mixed red, yellow, and orange with the green pepper for color and a milder flavor. I also added an extra pound of ground beef and served it over fresh bowtie pasta (if desired, on the side) to add some substance and stretch the batch to all the enthusiastic consumers.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This looks awesome and I love some of the reviews. I too thought about 1/2 C chopped onion and also changed to 1Qt water and 1Qt chicken stock. makes the juices a little richer. I love those like me that think to tweak a recipe to maybe make it a little better. YUM
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#My husband said that this soup is the best he has ever had! I added a half cup of chopped onion when I browned the hamburger and I used Minute Rice, adding it about ten minutes before serving. Then I sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on to serve it.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This soup is delicious. I belong to a soup club at work and it was my turn. I used two smaller cans of diced tomatoes, one with onion and the other with roasted garlic. Everyone loved it.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Love this soup. Making another pot today
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#1#Have been on the hunt for the best Stuffed Pepper Soup and this is it! I used a box of beef broth (and no added salt) for half of the water and a can of Italian tomato sauce. Also added 3/4 cup orzo pasta. I debated using the brown sugar but don't be afraid..it is delicious! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Great soup base, add garlic, add cayenne pepper. I used the larger diced tomatoes and it made enough soup to try and freeze. Love this recipe.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I used 3 cans of garlic flavored pasta sauce in place of tomatoe juice. I increased water and added 4 peppers. added two cans stewed tomatoes. 4 cups rice
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#My Hubby loves this more than stuffed peppers. He says you get more of everything in 1 bite and it is much easier to eat. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Great soup, for some more flavor, use the garlic/herb diced tomatoes. Adds great flavor to it!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Family loved this soup.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Tasted great!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#My husband loves this soup. It's perfect for a cold winter's night with some crusty bread and butter. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This recipe was so good. I'm an older senior who needs easier things to make. I love stuffed green peppers & I cook a lot. This made it so much easier to get that taste without all the work. I put in 1/2 the brown sugar as I don't care for sweet food. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#easy and is very good
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This recipe is so very tasty. Followed the recipe and we all loved it.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Made this last night and husband loved it. That's enough to make me add this to my recipe collection. This is sure to be a regular at our house. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I've made this recipe for years! Great stuff. Also make a great pasta sauce if made a little thicker! Adjust spices to suit your taste on any given day. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#So so good!! We spiced it up by using Italian sausage instead of hamburger and made it thick by using 2 cups uncooked rice instead of cooked rice. Plenty of liquid in the original recipe to allow the rice to cook up well!!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This is nice.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I made this over the weekend and planned on using it for a couple of meals throughout the week. My suggestion? Do not put the rice in until you are ready to eat it. I put all the rice in, and the next morning, it was just a big ball of rice...all the liquid absorbed. I was very disappointed.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I made this several weeks ago with minor changes... omitted the brown sugar, and added hot paprika. I also didn't add the rice until just shortly before we ate because I don't like mushy rice. There wasn't a drop left! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I found this recipe very bland. If I make this again I will add some Italian Seasoning or basil. It was disappointing the way the recipe is written.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I've made this soup several times and its always a winner in our house! I can't stand green peppers, but can tolerate the milder yellow and orange varieities, so thats what I use. I also use less water to give it a richer taste. All in all, one of our favorite soups! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I made this tonight and everyone loved it. It was the perfect taste on this chilly fall day. It has SO much flavor!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Woah! So how did I NOT know this soup existed? Yum...I added everything except the bullion cubes and switched out the plain diced tomatoes for Rotel instead, and added the worcestershire sauce like another review said to, and it's got just the right heat with the Rotel, you won't need anymore. Bon Appetit! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#1#0#This is a very yummy and quick soup to make usually have all the stuff on hand! My only changes were to brown the beef w/the green peppers and added onions, celery and garlic (as i just love those flavors in soup) and substituted beef broth for the water and bouillon and added 1 extra cup of rice. MMMMMMM
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This recipe first appeared in the 1997 TOH cookbook and it's been my family's favorite ever since! In fact, everyone who has ever tasted it has asked for the recipe. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#The best I have tasted.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#We love this soup! At this time of year we have an abundance of peppers and tomatoes so when I make it I substitute 3 Cups of diced fresh tomatoes. In the winter, I use canned tomatoes and green and red peppers that I have frozen with great results.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I made this last night and declare it a winner. I made just a couple small changes. First I halved the recipe. I omitted the brown sugar and added chopped onions. Even halved, it made a lot of soup. This is a delicious soup and I will definitely make it again. Worth five stars!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This soup was wonderful, I will make it often, I sauteed the peppers a bit before I browned the ground beef, and added onion. Nothing to change the taste, it was delicious. We all loved it.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I would not change a thing. Marvelous.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#A big hit with my husband & sons! I used homemade tomato sauce & fresh chopped tomatoes. Great way to use up garden produce!10/2014: My sons now call this my favorite soup ! I use half the water (I usually use stock if I have it on hand to replace the water), 1/2 the sugar (I usually use sucanat), double the green peppers (or any color peppers I have on hand), and canned or homemade tomato puree (if I have fresh tomatoes, I just chop those up to replaced the canned tomatoes or put them in my food processor to puree them in place of the tomato sauce). I have used cooked barley instead of rice and all varieties of rice--red, black, jubilee rice, brown rice--instead of white rice. Each pot is always met with rave reviews! You can definitely boost the nutrition of this with a few simple changes! Thank you so much, Krista Muddiman, for a soup that I'm sure one day my sons' wives will request the recipe! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Despite the 97 degree temperature, I made this because of all the peppers from our garden. We thought it was a tasty soup. I did add onion, garlic and Worcestershire sauce and substituted beef broth for the water.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I came, I saw, I made, I loved it.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#yummy
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This recipe is absolutely awesome. The only thing I did different was add 4 envelopes of Swanson Beef Boost. This soup is sooooooooo good!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Absolutely wonderful! I wouldn't change a thing. I made it for the first time yesterday and have already shared it with several friends! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This is great on any day. I had frozen green peppers from my garden and added them. Very good!!!!!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#2#0#I do substitute beef broth and it could use more green peppers, but it is yummy on a cold night. I think that it's funny that some folks substitute all of the ingredients. Is it still the same recipe?:) 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Excellent! that's enough 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#i made this for my boyfriend and his kids they loved it and it was my first time trying it along with my three year old son and well lets just say their wasnt any left!!!!!!!!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Wow.. this was a hit during the latest deep freeze in the Northeast. I followed suggestions here and added an onion & minced garlic to the beef. Used beef stock, Marinara sauce, better than boullion beef base & diced tomatoes with jalapenos, plus an additional cup of peppers. Brown rice into the bowl when serving, because its what I had on hand. A nice sprinkle of Parmesan cheese is a must...it isn't stuffed peppers without the cheese. My family & neighbors enjoyed this so much..I may never make traditional stuffed peppers again. Thank you Hosses for the keeper recipe.Haha..well look at that, making it again after a storm almost three years exactly to the date. Yummo. House smells crazy good. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#1#One of the most delicious soups to make when it's cold outside! So many flavor layers! I did use ground turkey, added some Worcestershire sauce, vegetable stock instead of water, used Honey instead of sugar, quinoa instead of rice and used 1 can of Italian diced tomatoes and 1 can of fire roasted diced tomatoes. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Very good! I cooked the hamburger and peppers together and added an onion. Substituted beef broth for the water and left out the beef bouillon. Husband (a very picky eater) agreed that it was very good! We ate ours with a little cheese on top.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#made this for my family and everyone loved it, I will definetly make this again!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I own a deli and serve soups every day. I look for new ideas all the time. I saw this recipe, tried it, and it was a hit. I did substitute beef broth because I don't like water in soups. I also added more pepper and rice. this is a keeper for Plain Nuts Deli. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#My husband and I enjoyed this soup. I made a few changes to make it smaller since there are just the two of us: 1#ground beef, 1 can beef broth (in place of water and boullion), 14 oz diced tomatoes, and cooked instant white rice (we had in pantry). Otherwise I made as listed and it was great. Much thicker the second day and was great with cornbread muffins. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I look for hearty soup recipes. This one is delicious and filling.I made some modifications to it. I used venison sausage instead of beef, added 3 cups of rice instead of 2, reduced the pepper and eliminated the salt (only used the salt in the beef bouillon cubes). Served with homemade rye bread. Big hit.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Outstanding!Some changes I made:I browned the ground beef with a diced onion;I also used one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with habaneros for a bit of kick;and used more rice to make the soup thicker.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Very good. I did make a couple changes though. I was worried about the brown sugar since I don't like meat to have any sweetness to it so I gradually added white sugar and decided 1 T. was enough. I also added a t. of garlic powder. As for the rice, I added a cup of uncooked instant rice toward the end of cooking time and it was still plenty soupy . Oh, and I also added a small chopped onion when I browned the burger. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I tweaked the recipe a bit. I only had 1 lb of ground beef. I did not use tomato sauce, just the diced tomatoes (28 oz). I used only about 3 cups of water and only 1/8 c of brown sugar. I added a diced onion, minced garlic, about 1 tbsp of worestershire, and a few dashes of hot pepper sauce. Since I reduced the amount of brown sugar, I added just a dash of clove. Instead of rice, I added 1 c of barley. IT WAS AMAZING!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Recipe was very good, with the exception of the rice. I think it would work better with uncooked long grain rice. Otherwise the soup is too watery. I ended up using 2x the amount of rice called for to make it thicker.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Marvelous!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Haven't made it yet, but was wondering if you all used 28 oz of tomatoe sauce? 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Excellent! Comfort food made simple!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Loved it! It's an easy and quick way to eat stuffed green peppers. Hmmmm 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#GREAT soup!! Let alone from my Mom in laws hometown!!!! AWESOME!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#My family is very pleased with this recipe! I did read through the reviews before making and decided to make some adjustments of my own. I started off by cooking the green peppers with 1lb of ground beef (not 2), which I seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, and a little seasoning and kosher salt. I also used beef stock instead of water and cut it back to about 46.5oz (1 32oz box container and one 14.5oz can) instead of 2 quarts. My family and I like a thicker consistency with our soups so I added a little at a time, making sure it was just right. I also used 3c of (cooked) instant brown rice (that's what I had in the pantry) since another review recommended it! This soup turned out way better than expected and my SO says it's definitely a keeper! I also liked the idea of serving it with bread so I added Hawaiian Sweet Rolls to our meal! Yummy! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I LOVE this soup!!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#My husband, who doesn't like stuffed peppers, loved this soup! It was an instant favorite from the first bite. Awesome recipe, I didn't add all the water called for, and used half sausage instead of all beef. A keeper for sure!! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Update - had a ton of leftovers and froze them. I'm happy to report this soup freezes and reheats extremely well. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This was good, but I did add some onion and Italian seasoning and salt and pepper. diff will make again. Even thought about adding 1/2 Hamburger and 1/2 Italian sausage.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Decided to try this recipe after my boyfriend requested stuffed peppers. We both thought the leftovers from this recipe would be better for reheating than actual stuffed peppers. Based on other reviews, I added a whole chopped onion & 3 cloves of garlic to the ground beef as it browned. I used 1.5 Quarts of reduced sodium beef broth and brown long grain rice. I also reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon and added 1 tablespoon of dried basil and 1 teaspoon each of dried rosemary and thyme. We topped it with shredded extra sharp cheddar and had crusty French bread on the side. It was extremely filling and fairly healthy. I used 93/7 lean ground beef, and with the additional spices, we found it very flavorful. I hope it will reheat well as my freezer is stocked full of it.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#My sister passed this recipe on to me and it's delicious. I add much less water and reduce the s & p. We like the thicker consistency. I serve it with a hearty bread. Umm, umm, good! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Very easy to make and delicious! Serve with crusty bread!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I used 1 lb ground turkey and 1 lb sausage. I also reduced the salt to 1 tsp. It was excellent!!!!! It really makes a lot. Will probably have to freeze some. My kids even liked it!!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I try to find recipes that are quick and delicious for my job at an assisted living facility, I thought this one looked good. Tried it out on my family yesterday, my husband and I really enjoyed it! I will make it for the residents this week! Thank You!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I love this recipe, but my problem isn't the recipe itself but the comment made by the submitter that leads pple to believe they created this recipe. The recipe has been around for a lot longer AND there's a starlite tavern in PA that has one of the first versions of this. Not this place. Good either way though and I recommend it. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This is a very delicious soup. Getting ready to make it again.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I cut this recipe in half and added a can of tomatoe soup. Its delicious
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I've made this recipe for a year and love it. Then tasted a friends Stuffed Pepper soup and she added a can of Rotel tomatoes that has Chillies and about 1/3 package of Taco mix. This really adds to the whole recipe. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This was great! I added celery and onion to the meat while it was browning. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as written. I will definitely make this again!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Made this last night for my husband's study group of graduate students. Great recipe, easy and made enough for seconds for everyone. Delicious. Will make it one of my routine dishes! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Used Red, Yellow, and Orange Peppers in addition to the Green. Had to leave, so after bringing to boil, covered, turned off the heat. Came back 2.5 hours later - It was outstanding!!Definitely will make again!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I made this recipe with some slight variations. Diced half an onion and saute'd the peppers and onions in a tbsp of extra virgin olive oil for several minutes. Then I added a clove a fresh garlic minced. Instead of beef I used ground turkey to cut down on fat and used beef broth instead of water, omitting the beef boullion granules. Came out great and we loved it. Will make it again. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#The brown sugar adds just the right amount of sweetness. Excellent soup!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This soup is easy to make and very very tasty as well as filling. We loved it and I would make it again.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Absolutely delicious!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This was an awesome soup, but I did make a few changes as others did...used beef broth, added a large onion & a little garlic to meat when browning...Also spiced it up with a palm full of dried basil and a lesser amount of dried rosemary, thyme & marjoram....Tasted just like the stuffed peppers Mom used to make. Everyone gobbled it up (Also used sweet red and yellow peppers since some have digestion issues with the green)
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This recipe was good. I used beef broth in place of the water and the boullion and also only used half of the amount called for, for a thicker soup. The flavor was rather mild and could use some spice, but it was good. I added velveeta cubes on top, that melted over the soup, which greatly enhanced the soup! Makes tasty leftovers too.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#A great filling soup that's perfect on a fall or winter evening. Will definitely make this a regular meal! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I have made this recipe for several years. If you like Stuff Bell Peppers you will love this. Taste exactly the same. I add an envelope of Lipton's Onions Soup and about a tablespoon of minced garlic. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I only used one pound of hamburger and a little less water. It tastes EXACTLY like a stuffed pepper. My husband says it's a keeper! VERY GOOD. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Very, very tasty! I substituted 4 boullion cubes for the granules, used less tha 1/4 cup of brown sugar and used 4 tsp. Kosher salt for the regular salt. Very easy and quick! I took this to a 5 person luncheon and brought home very little. Everyone asked for the recipe. Thanks!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This really tasted like stuffed peppers without all the fuss. I used red and yellow sweet peppers, very good!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I thought the tomato base tasted on the bland side. So, like one of the reviewers, I added a couple dashes of garlic powder when browning the ground beef, which definately zips it up, plus, I added about 3-4 dashes of worcestershire sauce, and 3 shakes of cayenne pepper to the soup. This recipe is easily customizable to your family's taste buds! I will definately add to my recipe file! Thanks! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I followed the instructions as given except I made a topping to make it taste more like my wifes stuffed peppers. I used buttered croutons with some grated cheddar cheese. It was fantastic.! thanks . jim
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#this soup was delicous. even dh who is not really a soup guy loved it. i did make a couple improvements to the original recipe. instead of water i used 2 qts beef broth, i added one small onion diced, i used seasoned pepper instead of regular pepper, i used left over rice and added it to the bowls before i ladeled the soup over. garnished with a touch of shredded yellow cheese. yummy!!!!!!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I made this recipe a few days ago and we are just finishing up the left-overs. This soup was GREAT. I did make a few changes to it but didn't do anything unusual. I used 1 1/2 lbs ground beef and added 4 cups of cooked rice to the soup. 2 cups of rice wasn't nearly enough. It had too much broth with that small amount. I did use Beef Stock instead of water because water doesn't bring anything to the party if you get my meaning. The soup was excellent and I will definitely make it again. Thank you for a wonderfull recipe! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I added a small can of whole corn w/peppers and it realy made it great. I realy like the system Taste of Home has for printing out the recipes. You can select the size,color picture(if wanted) and health info. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I have been making this for years. I add a big can of tomato juice and lots more peppers to it. We love it and have had many requests for the recipe.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I would give it a 5 star, but it is just a little too watery for our taste. I only used 1 lb of hamburger, and added extra rice, but next time I will cut back a bit on the water.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This is the second time I have made this soup and it just gets better. Both times instead of cooking the rice before adding, I put it in raw (using brown rice) and it makes it get nice and thick.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Love this soup-have made it lots of times and have given recipe to family and friends. Definately will make again and again.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Needed a quick and easy meal on a cold rainy evening and this turned out really great!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Our family LOVES this recipe.. We do however replace water with beef broth and green peppers for sweet peppers. Cook the rice separately. It is a nice heart bold soup.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This is the best soup.. We use sweet peppers in place of green peppers and it is to die for!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#EXCELLENT!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#a great soup for winter!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Amazing soup!! I dont even like green peppers and I LOVED this! I like my soups more hearty like a stew so I omitted some of the water and I added extra green peppers! I also tried doubling the recipe except the beef because I think 2 pounds is a lot and it turned out fantastic!! Yum!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I made this recipe with stew beef cubes instead of ground beef, and diced fresh tomatoes in place of the diced canned. I cooked the rice separately and added it at the end. I would definitely make it again and want to try it with ground beef next time.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I was specifically looking for this recipe. I used to make it and lost it. I throw everything into the crockpot except the rice-let it cook all day, then stir in instant rice when i get home. Itis fantastic!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This soup is wonderful! Everyone who tried it raved it was so good!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Update to previous review: I seasoned the leftovers with just a bit (about 1 tsp) of garlic powder and it made such a dramatic change. it was delicious!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Use 2 quarts beef stock, omit the water and beef bouillon. Cook rice on the side.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This soup was really good. I was skeptical but the photograph looked so good, I decided to try it. It was my first time making it so I followed the recipe. Next time I make this, I will cut back on the amount of water but other than that - it was perfect. It does actually taste just like stuffed peppers with much LESS work.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This recipe does call for 2 cups COOKED long grain rice , so I don't know why it would turn out gummy. You are supposed to cook the rice before you add it to the soup. This is absolutely a wonderful soup. Even my husband who doesn't like stuffed peppers, or green peppers at all for that matter, loves this soup. I add a small chopped onion, and saute the onion and green pepper when I brown the ground beef. Drain. Then add the rest of the ingredients. Delish! 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Made with ground turkey, diced tomatoes with chilies, omitted the salt, and used 3 cups rice.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#1#This soup was just average to me. I think that if you like a stuffed pepper soup this is great, but I tend to like a more creamy soup. I probably won't make this again. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I used a vegetarian meat substitute (Morningstar Farms Crumbles) instead of ground beef. I also used 4 cans of vegetable broth instead of the water and bouillon. I did make it with 2 cups of cooked brown rice in the pot the entire time and it was fine. Great recipe! My family loved it!
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#the recipe is good but the RICE should be cooked separately or only for 20 minutes. It became GUMMY if recipe is followed. need improvement.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Awesome!!! I used 1 large green pepper and 1 red pepper. The flavors were awesome. Also, I used 1 lb. ground round, 1/4 lb. sweet Italian sausage and about 1/3 lb. of left over meatloaf and brown rice. Definitely a make-again recipe.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This is so-o-o good! My kids don't like stuffed peppers but they love this. I've served it in bread bowls made from dough using my bread machine and then baked. I don't cook the rice beforehand. I put 1 Cup uncooked rice and 2 Cups extra water in the last 20 minutes of simmering. Turns out great. I also subbed chicken bouillon for the beef'cause that's what I had on hand. Delicious, hearty soup =) 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#Yum! Just needs some extra humpf to get five stars. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I love this recipe. So easy and I usually have all the ingredients on hand. I make it several times a year and my family loves it.
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I made this with lean ground turkey for a healthier version and it was DELICIOUS! We ate it all week and I'm making it again tonight! :) 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#I couldn't find plain diced tomatoes so I used the kind with green chilies in it. It was WAY too spicy! I'll try it again without the chilies and hope it's not so spicy. Will definitely make again though. 
Stuffed Pepper Soup#0#0#This soup was hearty and wonderful on a cold winter night. I did substitute about 4 oz of sausage and used ground round instead of ground beef. I also used both green & red peppers. It is a lovely dinner soup!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#How many cups of batter does this make?
Moist Chocolate Cake#6#0#This is my go-to cake now. Everyone that I have served it to raved about this cake. I use my favorite Lavazza coffee for the brewed coffee. I substitute canned evaporated milk for the whole milk. My favorite frosting is a peanut butter frosting and I use it with this cake. I put a few piped swirls of frosting on top and top each swirl with a Reeses peanut butter cup.
Moist Chocolate Cake#2#0#Is there a high altitude version of this recipe? We love it, but have moved to Colorado and I cannot get the cake right.
Moist Chocolate Cake#7#1#I made this for Mother's Day desert. Fabulous. Everyone loved it, moist and really quick to put together. The icing is excellent as well. Not to sweet. I put almost a cup of good raspberry jam on the bottom layer and put the icing on the bottom of the top layer, shaped them together and it was perfect. I decorated the cake with fresh raspberries. The leftover cake is now 3 days old and just as delicious as the first day. I bake the cake a day ahead and iced in the morning. This will be my go to chocolate layer cake. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#11#5#This is the second time I've tried to make this cake and it just falls apart. This time I put it in for almost 20 mins longer and still, completely fell apart. It tastes great, I'll give it that. My MIL swears by this cake but I'm starting to wonder if she actually makes another one. It's really frustrating bc now I'm cakeless for my son's birthday after the same for Father's day. I bake and decorate cakes as a hobby but have never had this experience before. Maybe cutting the coffee or another liquid in half would work better or a higher temp? Idk either way I probably won't be trying again with this recipe. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#4#0#This for Chinyere, if you are worried about the coffee flavor in the cake, you can't tell it is there. If you don't want the caffeine, use decaf. Yes you can use regular cocoa, I used Hersheys. I made it in a regular cake pan 2 different times and it turned out great, cooking time at 325 was 40 - 45 minutes. Kick it up a notch with this icing: https://www.southernplate.com/grandma-pearls-flaky-chocolate-icing/ (be sure to double this icing recipe) 
Moist Chocolate Cake#2#2#I cannot wait to try this but I would rather bake it a bundt pan. Has anyone tried that?
Moist Chocolate Cake#2#0#The best chocolate cake and icing ever! Moist and delicious, reminiscent of Sara Lee cakes, of days gone by. Icing is perfection, just sweet enough and super creamy, similar to seven minute frosting and easier, goodbye buttercream icing.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Please is there any substitute for the brewed coffee and can l use the normal cocoa powder
Moist Chocolate Cake#1#0#I have been making this cake for over 30 years. It is the absolute best. Everyone loves it.
Moist Chocolate Cake#6#0#Delicious. Have been looking for a cake like this for years. Icing is amazing. Thank you!
Moist Chocolate Cake#4#0#I have been making this cake for 26 years. It's my favorite cake and I love the frosting! It's moist and delicious.
Moist Chocolate Cake#2#1#Cake is tasty but worse icing ever - both in taste and texture. Just threw the whole lot in the bin.
Moist Chocolate Cake#2#0#This was very good!! I made it the day before and kept in fridge, eating the cake chilled may have made it better. I did double the icing recipe and made 3 layers of cake, I will definitely make this again for an event! Better than store bought bday cake.
Moist Chocolate Cake#2#0#First time to try this recipe, it's easy and I love it. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#2#0#Love this recipe
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Awesome recipe, made a few times and always consistent results!
Moist Chocolate Cake#2#0#An amazing cake! Not difficult to make and delicious. Following some of the reviews, I used black/dark cocoa for half of the cocoa and made an extra half batch of icing using a bit more vanilla to bump up the icing flavour. We found that the icing really complements the cake. Definitely a make again.
Moist Chocolate Cake#5#0#This has been my favorite chocolate cake recipe for years now and has been my go to cake recipe. My Aunt loved the cake so much that she asked me for the recipe and made it for a bridal shower and everyone loved it. My cousin also asked for the recipe and entered the cake in a contest at school and won! I got this recipe from your magaine years ago.
Moist Chocolate Cake#1#0#This has been my go to cake whenever I feel the need to bake. Gonna make full sheet itll be quadruple the recipe Cant wait!!!
Moist Chocolate Cake#1#1#I just had to make this cake because I was intrigued with the frosting. As with other reviewers, it did take longer than 30 minutes. Per recommendations of some of the comments, I made 50% more icing than what the recipe calls for. This cake is wonderful and the frosting is great.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I know different areas cooking time can be different but in Oregon it took my 2-8 inch round cakes 45 minutes to bake .
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Wonderful chocolate cake. Worth the effort. My new favorite chocolate cake. It took my cake layers about 40 minutes to cook until they were done in the middle.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This Moist Chocolate Cake is excellent, and the delicious frosting takes it over the top!
Moist Chocolate Cake#1#0#Its a great recipe. My Grandmothers was the same minus the icing and I know this because this recipe has been on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa Can for 3 Generations at least! LOL 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Best chocolate cake recipe ever!
Moist Chocolate Cake#2#0#This is the perfect chocolate cake. It's super moist. It took 43 minutes to bake, not 30 which is no big deal. Also, next time I make it I think I need a little more frosting, which was equally awesome. PS in the frosting, use all butter, it's tasty! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Best chocolate cake recipe I've ever made. My family loved it! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#1 cup whole milk 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 cup butter, softened 1/2 cup shortening 1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Additional baking cocoa, optional
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Icing ingredients only lists 1 cup milk. Directions say combine milk and flour, how much flour?
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This icing recipe is my Mom's French Cream Frosting exactly and is WONDERFUL, not quite as sweet as most but still plenty sweet and ever so smooth! Can't wait to make this cake! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This recipe is great. However if you use only butter (1 cop) the frosting is much better! Whip butter and sugar till light and fluffy,then continue as stated..
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#What kind of sugar is used in the frosting...confectioners or regular...would superfine work??
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have found my chocolate cake recipe! This is exactly what I was looking for; rich, dense but not heavy, great chocolate flavor. Very moist! Delicious! I used vegetable oil because it's what I had. Came out beautiful. Definitely a keeper! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Oh, my gosh! This has been our family's favorite cake since I first made it when TOH debuted in 1993! We have six children, & all of them frequently requested it for birthdays, nameday treats, half-year birthdays (we celebrate a lot in our family!), baptismal anniversary days, etc. Our oldest daughter asked me to make it for her wedding reception in Oct. 2013! The only change I make is to make 1 1/2 times the amount of frosting & then use the recipe for the frosting in the TOH 2/96 issue for Pastel Chocolate Cake. We call the resulting cake Rainbow Cake. I don't change a thing in the recipes! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I'm still waiting for my cake to finish baking! It's all giggly in the middle and I need it in an hour and a half for my moms birthday. I may be throwing it out and buying one. What went wrong? 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#We make this recipe all of the time since I received my first issue of TOH. It is the requested chocolate cake. We do like it with the frosting recipe that comes with it but I have also done it up with chocolate frosting. I have reduced the amount of oil to 3/4 cup and the amount of sugar to about 1 1/2 cup.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I use a very similar frosting recipe that was my mothers, however it calls for confectionary sugar instead of granulated white sugar, which incorporates much easier and faster, with no grittiness. You can also easily add more powdered sugar if the frosting isn't sweet enough for your taste. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This has been my go-to chocolate cake since it was originally published in 1993! I have made it countless times, and it has never failed. Adding coffee to enhance chocolate is actually a very old trick. The unique frosting is also a keeper that I have used on this cake and many others. I have never seen frosting using a white sauce paste and granular sugar anywhere else. I will say I am glad to have a stand mixer now for the frosting since it takes so long for the granulated sugar to incorporate- even if you use fine grain.
Moist Chocolate Cake#1#0#Perfect chocolate cake! I have used this recipe many times and refuse to use any other chocolate cake recipe.
Moist Chocolate Cake#1#0#Similar to my moms cake but we used i think quarter cup mayo, and no canola oil or coffee, and raisins , try it ;) not salad dressing, real or low fat mayo , she preferred hellmans, raisins optional ;) ill have to try the coffee ;)
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Hands down favorite chocolate cake recipe! The coffee really helps with the color and flavor. I swap out the oil for butter and it gives it a richer and a bit denser taste and texture. Yum!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is my go to birthday cake for our whole family. It has never failed! It is ALWAYS so moist. It does not have a coffee taste, in case someone is curious; it is not overly chocolate, but just right. I've doubled it before when making my kids multi-layered, multi-shaped birthday cakes. Everyone always complements it!! I have made the frosting listed in the recipe, but have made other favorite frostings instead, too, mostly because I don't use shortening. I use all of my organic ingredients and follow the recipe exactly. Someone said the center comes out raw....the recipe does state that the batter will be very liquidy and it is. However, it does bake thoroughly without adding excessive time. I typically average a few extra minutes and it's perfect!!! It also does freeze great, without frosting. When I'm making shaped birthday cakes, I freeze my cut-off extra pieces as I'm layering and then take them out for a later day. Sometimes, I frost the pieces after removing from the freezer when serving, but not always. They're great without it too.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#The cake was phenomenal! my family loved it, and when I brought to my bake sale, it was the only item that was sold out completely. The only thing I added to it was a little more flour because the recipe was a little too liquidy. Other than that, it was an awesome cake!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#our favorite birthday cake to make. So moist and heavy. I rarely bake...but this cake always comes out perfect no matter what your skill baking level is. Its the best :) 
Moist Chocolate Cake#1#0#I am an experienced baker and this cake was less than disappointing. The middle was completely raw and sank to the middle SO MCH SO IT LOOKED LIKE A GIANT CRATER. Had to throw outand start over! I cooked it for so long that the edges were getting burnt DONT BAKE THIS CAKE
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Delicious family loved it
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I make this same cake only I use no sugar added applesauce.instead of oil...no difference in the taste...is still very moist just a whole lot better for you....
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Hi Michelle,Direction 4 is the beginning step for the icing. The flour is there.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have made this frosting/icing before and use it in my whoopie pies-it is amazing as is the cake!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Delicious! I did use half and half regular cocoa powder and special dark cocoa. And it is better the second day! Great cake.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Good cake
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Excellent
Moist Chocolate Cake#1#0#There is obviously a typo in this recipe. Our oven temp is correct we even got out the thermometer just to make usre, but it took an hour to cook 2, 9 pans and they overflowed. 3 cups of liquid (Oil, coffee and milk) will not work with only 2 cups of flour. I'm with Leehigh69. This recipe is missing something (like another cup of flour). Perhaps you don't notice so much in a larger 13 x 9 pan. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I think this is a good starting point but it didn't have much flavor and we won't be making this again. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Hey, how can I half this recipe but still use 2 eggs, and the rest I would like to half
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have made a wacky choc.cake for years and this :has similar ingredients.But I question that this recipe has only 2c of flour, not 3c. Likel theacky cake.I have not baked this cake because of the flour discrepancy.Are you sure it is 2c flour.? For the . Liquid ,sugar,and cocoa amount IT does not seem proportional to the liquids.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Loved it! Didn't make the frosting but it is awesome just like that. Thank you. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Love this cake! First time I made it I hesitated putting shortening in the frosting, but it's so good! Very moist and chocolatey...my kids always ask me to make it for their birthdays. Definitely a keeper! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Reminds me of your grandmother as well specially of her moist cakes
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake recipe is delicious! I used a different recipe for the frosting so can't comment on the icing provided on here. My only complaint is that it sunk a bit in the middle. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#My favorite cake and frosting. Perfect every time!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Gram-9 when shortening is listed as an ingredient, it's always solid. Hope that helps. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#My Aunt gave us this icing recipe 60 years ago. I remember she had blue hair : )) The cake is excellent too. In warm weather I use all Crisco in the icing. Also I use my hand mixer to blend the flour & milk WHILE its cooking NO LUMPS. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Is the shortening liquid or solid?
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I've been eating this cake for the past 60 years and making it for the past 45. It's a bit time consuming and the icing takes practice to get just the right consistency for the cooked milk/flour icing but....It is soooooo worth it!. This is truly my favorite all=time cake recipe. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is the Hershey's Cocoa recipe for the cake and the Waldorf Astoria recipe for the frosting, but regardless of who created it, the cake and frosting are delicious together. I've been making it for around 10 years. The coffee adds a really rich flavor to the chocolate cake, but doesn't make it taste like coffee. The cake has a very moist crumb. Also, I'm not a huge chocolate fan, and I can't do chocolate frosting on top of chocolate cake, so I love the contrast of the vanilla flavored frosting. This cake keeps well in the fridge and maintains its moisture nicely. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Loved the cake and the frosting . My mother and I had a similar version only we didn't use vanilla (which is a great extra) and shortening was substituted with margarine instead.?? 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I loved the cake!! So moist, chocolaty, and soft! This will be my new go to chocolate cake recipe. However, we were not fans of the icing. It was kinda....bland, and runny. not really runny, but thinner than I would have liked.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have loved this recipe ever since I found it in the first issue of Taste of Home. The cake is moist and delicious and the icing is superb!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Does the icing use powdered sugar or granulated sugar?
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is the best cake I have ever made. My family loves it, it is always a hit. I did have to cook it longer. My oven runs a little bit hot and I usually have to reduce cooking time but with this recipe I cooked for an additional 10 minutes.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I love this cake!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#My husband is famous for making this cake. In the icing, we use 2 T. cornstarch instead of the flour and add 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. It is addictive!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#this is almost the same as a cake I make all the time except there is a lot more oil added. Some have said there was not enough flavor, I always use Hershey's special dark cocoa in mine and it makes a huge difference. And the frosting recipe is what I use as a filling inside the cake. and use a buttercream on top. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Loved loved loved this cake! I not read the reviews beforehand, did not use parchment paper but mine thankfully did not stick! I had deep pans also so no overflowing either. But I will say cook time was way off...it was considerable more. But it turned out so yummy! Very moist cake! I will use again but with a differ icing. Was not a fan of that icing at all!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Although moist I didn't find it very flavorful. Maybe I didn't measure right. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This known as Ginny's Chocolate CakeYes instant coffee works or Coke worksBuy Wondra Flour for the icing and use Real Vanilla 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake was very moist with a light not very sweet frosting. I followed the recipe with the minor suggestion of adding a smidge more cocoa powder. For anyone that might find this helpful: the cocoa powder was Hershey unsweetened, for the frosting I used unsalted butter and regular white sugar not confectioners. The frosting is enough to generously frost the whole cake.I baked in a 9x3 round pan with parchment paper on the bottom and sprayed Pam all over the pan. Baked at 325.it did not overflow... It baked maybe 45-1hr I didn't take the time. I also added strawberry filing with a thin layer of frosting in the middle as a personal preference but the cake itself is moist! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Very easy to make. I lined pans with parchment paper as suggested and it still stuck a bit on sides, though I liberally greased pans. Very good cake. My Dad loved it.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake look exactly like the display cake and is so light and moist, the icing is similar to whip frosting like I love!! I will definitely make this again and again in the near future..
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is the BEST cake recipe I have found, and I have been looking for a long time. I first made it for my mother-in-law's birthday, and we were all very happy with the results. The next time I baked this cake I flavored the icing with mint extract, and I am now in the process of repeating that icing for the cake for Christmas. I have found THE cake for any and all of my chocolate cake needs and desires! =) 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake has been our go to birthday cake since I found the recipe many years ago in Taste of Home....it is simply the best and all my family and friends look forward to birthdays so I can make it for them. The frosting is so yummy too! I have been using a rich European cocoa and this certainly does enhance the flavor and for an additional twist you could use Mexican vanilla for the regular vanilla. Awesome cake!! I have also made it into cupcakes.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I love this cake and the frosting is so light and fluffy, it's like my great grandmothers. My middle daughter always wants this for her birthday cake. I have found refrigerating the frosting overnight makes it creamier. I have added red food coloring so my brother can have his special Red Velvet cake he don't have a clue. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I absolutely love this recipe!!! moist and very flavorful. 1 question though. I am going to make a 12in round cake. Could anyone tell me how many cups of batter this recipe is. I've never measured it before with making just 2 9 in round cakes. thanks 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#The cake was delicious! I did not make the frosting. I made it in 2 9 by 13 pans for a layered birthday cake. It was a bit hard to stack but I expected that because I made it in a different pan than intended. Absolutely delicious though. Very moist.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#i just made it then. it was delicious!!! love this recipe mmmmm mmmmm :D im in australia and substituted copha for the shortening. this recipe is amazing :D
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I just made this cake yesterday. OHMYGAWD! YUMMY! I lessened the amount of sugar in the icing and also used powdered sugar instead. YUMMY! What a keeper! And the cake is MOIST! Love it! ...I just wasn't able to use two baking trays...poured it all in one...and ended up with a volcanic cake. Haha! But taste wise....YUMMEH!!! https://instagram.com/p/7gG5mkyUnJ/?taken-by=missgladysl 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I just made this cake but it stuck so bad to the pan it could not be used as a birthday cake. WARNING!! Use parchment paper! It tastes great though...
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have made this cake time and time again. My family loves it and I have shared it with many friends. I did adjust the temperature up to 350 from 325 and bake time to 35 minutes. I still check the center at 30 minutes but that's just a habit. The frosting is so light and fluffy. If you start the first half of the frosting before you begin putting the cake ingredients together, it saves time. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This chocolate cake is amazing! Easy, moist and nice chocolate flavor. You can taste the coffee in the batter but not in the cooled cake. It just adds a deeper fuller taste. Sometime I substitute half the cocoa powder with dark chocolate powder. I occasionally try different chocolate cake recipes and even if they are good I always come back to this cake as a reliable, delicious go to option. I have never tried this frosting recipe.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#So good!!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#just made the cake it was reallygood
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is our very favorite chocolate cake. We have been making it for over 20 years. We renamed it Suzie Q cake. Because that's exactly what it tastes like! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Best and easiest chocolate cake EVER! However it is NOT light and airy but rather very dense and heavy; fabulous. Also - the icing listed here is extremely heavy and if refrigerated is very thick and almost solid. It is better using a different lighter icing
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made this cake for valentine's /birthday cake. My family loves it. It did stick to pan so will use waxed oaper next time. Put red food coloring and it was perfect. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#CAKE IS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! Prepared according to recipe without modification. No issues with batter running over cake pans, although one pan came close. Suggest using deep pans. Cook time was 35 minutes. Frosting is a separate subject. Although it turned out without issues (was not runny or grainy and did not have strong flour or shortening tastes) I will not make it again. The only positive thing I can say about it was that it was not a terribly sweet frosting, which I liked. I did not like all the fat and hydrogenated oils and will look elsewhere for a frosting recipe to compliment this outstanding cake.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is the second time I've made this cake and it came out great both times. The cake is very moist and has a smooth chocolate flavor. I actually prefer this frosting because it's not as sweet as most. It allows for the chocolate flavor of the cake to stand out. After baking it, it does tend to stick (a little) to the bottom of the pan so I might try the parchment/wax paper suggestion next time. I didn't have problems with the baking time. Both layers were finished in the 25-30 minute suggested time. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This the the best homemade cake I've ever made or eaten! Moist with great flavor.Made this twice and it came out perfect both times. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I had intended to make a different chocolate cake for an event but realized I didn't have all the ingredients the day I was going to make it. Just 2 days prior I had come across this recipe and had all the ingredients on hand. I normally would not try a recipe for the first time for something special, but I had promised to bring a cake so I went for it. I made it in a 9x13-inch pan, putting waxed paper on the bottom of the pan and using cooking spray before pouring in the batter, and baked it for 40-45 minutes. I used a buttercream frosting that I had already planned on. Everyone LOVED this cake! There were other desserts there but mine got eaten first. I will be making this again! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#The cake is super moist, however the flour and shotening in the icing should be swithed out because it gives the frosting a bad taste. The amount of the frosting needs to be decreased because it ran over the cake and everywhere else. Some of the batter stuck to the bottom of the cake pan, perhaps a lining of parchment paper would have been better. Other than that it was a wonderful cake.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Before I make this, we don't drink coffee so have NONE in the house - and don't wish to buy it just for this recipe. Can someone suggest an alternative? How about orange juice? Water? Almond milk? Thank you in advance for your reply. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made this for my grandson's birthday. I did not use this frosting as chocolate frosting was requested. It did take a little longer to bake but the awful part was while baking in two 9 pans the batter ran over the top and I had a huge mess in the bottom of the open. I would have to have put it in two 8 pans. When I make this again, I will definitely use a 13 x 9 x 2 pan. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#One of the easiest, moistest, best cakes ever! I have made it several times with no issues, and my mother made it often. If you have issues, you are not following the instructions exactly and correctly, it's that simple. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#i read all of these reviews and finally I found one that had the same issues. I can not believe no one had issues! I used 9 pans, the dough over flowed and created a huge mess. The pans were greased ,floured and cooled and the cake stuck to the pans. The cake was moist maybe to moist. The cooking time was way off. I cooked it for an hour. And yes my oven's temp is correct. The icing.....had an after taste of flour and I still had grit from the sugar. After doing patch work on the cake, I salvaged it to a degree. NO I would not recommend this cake to anyone. It was a disaster!, 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Wonderful made it yesterday , I too only used butter for the icing and also curdled a bit , but was magic the flavour is amazing ! What I did add in was some Panettone essence to both the cake and icing adds a wonderful flavour . Will make again !
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Made this today and it was incredibly moist and delicious! The frosting was a little curdled in appearance (I used all butter and no shortening as others suggested) but the flavor was fantastic. I always use Hershey's Special Dark cocoa for a dark chocolate flavor. Will definitely make again. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Made this today. First time I've made a cake from scratch that wasn't dry. It was so easy and quick. Turned out fantastic. Changed the icing a bit, used all butter and added a bit of cream cheese and cocoa to make a chocolate icing. We loved it. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#is the dry chocolate part the hersheys can unsweetened cocoa.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Awesome nothing else is needed to be said????????
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Usually I make box mix cakes but this cake was delicious and easy enough that I will definitely make again. Followed recipe exactly cake was moist and delicious, the coffee flavor does not come out in the end result if you are worried about that. Cake cooked in 33 minutes. The recipe for the frosting was really nice as well, make sure you whisk the flour/milk mixture while its cooking. Also granulated sugar is the correct sugar to use, end result is not grainy at all. The end taste of the frosting was light and delicious, look was very glossy and shiny. Frosting was good but the cake is so good on its own you don't need that much frosting, next time will cut frosting recipe in half. Great recipe! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#love it the cake and the ICING thanks for sharing so we can try it
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Great cake, easy to make. I use brewed coffee but instant will work as well you just need the flavor of coffee to intensify the chocolate. I had never used this icing before but it was great, too. Thanks for sharing.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Can't wait to try this recipe, but would like to know if it would work as a sheet cake? I gave it 5 starts because of all the tremendous already 5 star ratings it has gotten. I would though, use all butter instead of using shorting in the icing. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Love this cake. I used to make it years ago. I couldn't find the recipe and then I opened my email and there it was. I think one could use instant coffee, just make a cup of it, then add to recipe. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#For bushbabe I have several recipes that call for brewed coffee and all I use is instant. Just make it like you would for a cup of coffee and add it into the recipe. Any recipe that calls for espresso powder I also use the granulated instant but I crush it to make it a powder then I measure. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This sounds delicious! We only drink instant coffee in our house. Does anyone know the results if instant was substituted for brewed? I'm anxious to try it, but don't want to waste the ingredients and ruin it by using instant coffee. Has anyone baked this with instant coffee? 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I've been making this cake for over 20 years and everyone loves it. The coffee enhances the chocolate flavor. Peanut butter frosting put it over the top. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have used this wonderful recipe for many years. My children and I have won many blue ribbons and Best of Show using this recipe. I often use a chocolate butter cream frosting.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#have used this recipie for years, using all butter or margarine for icing, no shortening. 5 Tbl. flour is correct
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I can't help but noticing 5 tbsps. of FLOUR for the icing???? Is this an error???Also baking cocoa......not sure if I can get it here, so can I substitute with the regular cocoa, which we mix for tea?? Apart from these 2 enquiries, I'm ok and dying to get started. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I use a similar recipe for icing, but use 1 cup butter instead of the butter/shortening mix, 4 T. flour. everything else the same. If you beat the butter and sugar well, it shouldn't taste grainy. We really like it because it isn't as sweet as regular butter-cream frosting. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This year I was in charge of my uncles birthday cake. I make chocolate cakes a lot, but I have never made such a good one! I loved it, and so did everyone else! Even my dad who eats lots of chocolate cake, and is picky about what he gets said that this was one of the best he had ever had! I have never done this before, but I printed out this recipe, it is definitely a keeper! I cooked it for 28 min. and used a different vanilla butter cream frosting recipe, and it tuned out FANTASTIC#BESTCAKEEVER : b : ) 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake sounds wonderful will be trying it soon.i wouldn't think the shortening would make the frosting not taste good because a lot of butter creams are half shortening half butter as in decorating cakes and reading the frosting recipe I would think either sugar would work I do know cheap shortening does not work as well and you don't want it to be more than a couple of months old. But as others have said regarding frosting you really need to beat it good You can almost burn up a hand mixer trying to beat it sometimes. Thanks for sharing 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made this today and its delicious. In fact, my whole family likes it. I followed the directions exactly, baking the cakes in 9 pans. They did take about 15 minutes longer to bake than directed, but I know that there are oven variations, various types of pans, etc. that would account for the difference.For those hesitant to make this because they don't like coffee, I can promise you the cake doesn't taste like coffee. I'm in my mid 50's, have never in my life had a cup of coffee, but still enjoy this cake. I was a little hesitant about making this frosting as its different from anything I've ever made, but it turned out great. Its not gritty as some said and I like it because its light in texture and not too sweet. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Baking time way off! I'm at 45 minutes and still gooey in the middle. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Wow! This cake was so good! I followed all the directions exactly. I brought it to work and everyone raved over it. One lady I work with (who tends to be critical) said it was the best chocolate cake she ever ate. I loved the icing, too. Great texture and flavor. Just make sure you whip it well!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#What an amazing cake! Usually I do boxed mixes but this was far superior, and not much work. Very moist, rich and delicious. It was even better the next day! I didn't do the frosting recipe but used canned vanilla frosting. A thin layer was all you needed because the cake is so rich on its own. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have never rated a recipe before but this was very very good! I followed the recipe as written, including the icing and everything turned out great! Thanks for sharing.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#EXTREMELY Moist cake! The recipe really does make two 8 inch round cakes plus cupcakes so be prepared! I attempted to make the frosting but my shortening was bad (I had no idea it went bad). I agree though with the WYOpink that it tasted waxy. Next time I would use a cup of butter instead. This time I substituted a can of store bought chocolate frosting and my chocaholic LOVED it! That's all that really matters!!! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake is amazing! You really must try it. Do use the coffee as well. It doesn't taste like coffee. I made it with regular and decaf and preferred the decaf cake. My husband and our 3 boys also loved the flavor. This cake is very moist. I won't ever buy another box cake again. Now...the frosting...not very good. It tasted waxy and like shortening. It turned out just as stated but doesn't compare to buttercream. I used this frosting recipe the first time I made the cake and was disappointed in it. The second time I made it and used a vanilla meringue buttercream and it was perfect. Thank you for the wonderful cake recipe! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I was very nervous about baking a chocolate cake, I have had my share of to dry....but not this one. It was WONDERFUL. The only adjustment I used just a little more then a quarter cup of coco powder. The color was just right, Will bake again very very soon!!!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Made this cake today and it was delicious, nice and chocolaty. I used 8 inch round pans and baked at 325 degrees but had to bake for 45 minutes not 25 minutes as stated in the recipe. Will definitely make this again
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Made this recipe this weekend for my mother-in-law's birthday - it was so moist and tasty! Everyone loved it, and asked for more. I used cream cheese icing and it was just the right amount of sweet. You definitely CANNOT taste the coffee in it. Just chocolate, yummy chocolate!! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Excellent cake - very moist and wonderful flavor. I followed the directions exactly and no issues with grainy texture for the frosting. This is a keeper for us - thanks so much for sharing!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is a delicious cake - moist with a rich chocolate taste and a lovely icing. I followed the directions and the frosting frothed to wonderful consistency. Thanks to Ms. Kreitz for sharing it- It's absolutely a keeper!!! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Easy as anything I've ever baked and awesome!!! I did not use the coffee on second one but my hubby is a big coffee drinker so he prefers to add it!! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Love Love Love this cake. Definitely moist and creamy. Everyone should try this recipe. It is easy to make and even if it wasn't it would be worth the wait! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake is so delicious. The only change I made was to use 1/2 tsp vanilla plus 1/2 tsp almond extract since I love almond in chocolate. I am not a coffee drinker and did not taste any coffee in this cake. I took it to a potluck at church and came home with an empty plate. The frosting sounded very familiar as I believe I made it many years ago. It was not too sweet at all.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Delicious! And simple. For the icing, I used granulated sugar and followed directions to a tee, using my wire whisk attachment on my mixer to beat for 10 minutes. Did not turn out grainy at all.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have been making this cake for years, with love. My dear mother-in-law who has passed on gave it to me with a shower gift before my wedding. The whole family giggles when someone shows up with this cake...a cousin has been making it since she was a child and she told me it never let her down. It's called Never Fail Cake in my household. The coffee deepens the flavor and the texture is fluffy & moist, but it is not a coffee flavored cake. Sometimes I ice it with a peanut butter frosting and then stand back and watch people lick & scrape their plates. Yeah, it's that good. If I have to see one more 1 star rating from a reviewer that has not attempted the recipe...well, I'll just have another piece of cake and laugh. This isn't Pinterest or someone's blog, it lowers the rating unnecessarily. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This was one of my Mom's most-requested recipes. This is so delicious, and the light, not-too-sweet frosting brings back memories of Mom...! This recipe is a classic, and never disappoints! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Loved the moist chocolate cake recipe. The frosting comes out light and sweet. I prefer one of those richer frostings so I think I might try a different one maybe even chocolate frosting as well. Cannot say enough good stuff about this cake. That coffee I used was donut shop blend and cooled it before using in the cake. Delicious!
Moist Chocolate Cake#1#0#Cake is wonderful, just as is! For the frosting, it's granulated sugar, and you must follow the instructions and beat 10 minutes, using a whisk attachment if you have one. For me, it would be better using 1 cup of butter rather than half butter and half shortening, as I don't enjoy the shortening taste, but it was definitely a nicer consistency than my Mom's traditional buttercream and I'll be making this again using all butter. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I followed directions exactly and the cake turned out wonderful! I had no problems with the frosting. I used regular sugar I just made sure I mixed it well before adding milk mixture. This recipe is definitely a keeper! :)
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Confusing frosting recipe! Cake turned out great but I used regular sugar for frosting and I think it should have been POWDERED SUGAR instead. It was gritty. It did not specify. Please correct. 3 star
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is a wonderful cake. I also have made it in a 13 by 9 sheet cake and it is great. I wish that all those that rate without trying a recipe would please stop. There are forums to ask questions in to understand components in the instructions BEFORE rating and this would be helpful to them and eliminate unfair ratings for the recipes.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Any suggestions for altering this for high altitude?
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#....For new bakers... if a recipe simply says sugar , it means granulated. If powdered, or confectioner's sugar, etc., is to be used, the recipe then specifies accordingly. :) My students did a great job with this cake! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I've been making this cake for 43 yrs from the old Grange cookbook. It is the best chocolate cake ever! It is so moist and also tastes great with peanut butter icing! For those who do not like coffee....it does not have a coffee taste. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I need to tell you this is a cooked icing. You cook the flour and milk stirring constantly so there is no lumps and bring it to a boil. Then take it off the stove to cool down put in fridge until cold. Take white sugar (not confectioners) and other ingredients and mix until sugar is dissolved then add the flour and milk mixture and beat for 5 mins till it is light and fluffy. I have made this icing for years and it is wonderful. Good luck.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Coffee makes the chocolate more tasty and you absolutely do not taste any coffee. Also, the recipe says sugar -- NOT confectioners. To rate a recipe you haven't tested is indeed poor taste. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have been using this recipe for years, ever since it was first published. The absolute best cake and frosting you can imagine!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I am typically not one to eat chocolate cake, but since it is my mother's favorite I made this recipe for her birthday. I made it exactly as listed and it was amazing! I have never had any type of cake that was so moist. I can't wait to try the recipe for cupcakes! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#i have made this cak for over 20 years an it is still a good nw asthe first v trie it. everyone a work raves over it
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made this cake for my sister's birthday, and it was excellent! Since I baked it in a pyrex bowl, it took over an hour to bake. I was a little worried since I made it half whole wheat and only put in 1 3/4 c. sugar, but it turned out super moist and yummy! It was fairly dense, but really good! I didn't try the frosting, though. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made this cake for my mother's birthday and everyone raved about it. It was really moist and the icing was fluffy and tasted like whipped cream. I made it in a 9 x 13 and had to increase the baking time to 43 minutes. I will definitely be making it again. Now my family wants the recipe. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Absolutel;y delicious!!! Very moist, great flavor. I baked it in a 9x13 and only make half of the frosting called for and it was the perfect amount. Will make this again.
Moist Chocolate Cake#1#0#This is my go-to chocolate cake. I usually do it in a 9x13 or as cupcakes. Most of the time I make a different frosting or use store-bought frosting. I like this frosting recipe, but it is a little time consuming and I don't have a stand mixer. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Very delicious and moist. I am not a coffee drinker and you really don't taste the coffee. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#The most amazing cake and frosting ever!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#LOVE! I forgot to add oil and the cake was still marvelous. This is a keeper!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#A2thpro: You will never taste the coffee. I am a cake baker by trade and use it in all chocolate cakes. I HATE coffee, too. :)
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Have made this for years....family loves it and the frosting is excellent!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#looks great! Going to try it.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I was wondering if the icing uses granulated or powdered sugar? I really want to make this for my dad's birthday on Friday. I am trusting the reviews and that I won't ruin it. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Excellent cake! Also delicious with cream cheese frosting.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I dislike coffee flavor of any kind. Could I substitute water? I know coffee is supposed to enhance the flavor of chocolate, but yuck....I LOVE chocolate but can't even take mocha. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Best cake I ever tasted. I made this when it came out in the magazine and thought the icing recipe looked strange. It is so light and delicious. I have been looking for this recipe ever since I lost it. So glad to have found it again.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Best cake ever!!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Did anyone add the 5T of flour to the frosting? I've never added flour to frosting before and am afraid to try. It doesn't mention flour in the directions. Very confusing. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Best chocolate cake and icing ever. However I would 1 1/2 the icing. This cake needs 40-45 minutes baking!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#very good
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Best cake EVER
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#The cake was moist and delicious. The only problems I had was that it took a much longer time to cook because I used one rectangular pan and I had issues getting the lumps of shortening out of the frosting. The cake was delicious and you didn't notice the lumps when the frosting was on the cake so overall amazing! Will make again 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake came out as good as everybody said it would. I made an 8x8 square cake and twelve cupcakes with the recipe given since I didn't have round cake pans. With the 8x8 cake, I poked holes in it and poured chocolate syrup all over the top instead of frosting. It was amazing!! I will definitely be making this cake again. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Best chocolate cake recipe, extremely addicting, you have to try it, it was gone so quick! I made it with chocolate icing, next time I'll have to try the one on the recipe. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is a favorite of mine. I can't believe a scratch cake can be so chocolatey and moist. The frosting is not so rich and is great for decorating. If a buttercream frosting is your preference, check out the one at The cake recipes are the same. I lost my magazine and was thrilled to find this online. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Years ago I obtained this recipe from one of the Taste of Home magazines that I received on a monthly basis. From the first time I baked this cake and made this icing I have never selected another chocolate cake recipe. I have used other icings, like cream cheese frosting, which is also delicious on it. I have made this over and over for friends and family and have always been told it is the most wonderful and delicious cake they've ever tasted. Once I made it and took it to a church social and it was chosen to be auctioned off to church members to raise money for the young people. It was a lot of fun to see people bidding for it and it sold for a great price as they all knew it was wonderfully delicious! I've been asked for the recipe by many family members and friends. I have never had this recipe to fail when I made it. I love it! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made this today for a birthday. Wanted something different from what I had made before. This is an excellent cake, received raves from all my family. In fact I will be making it again next month for my nephew's birthday. I had seen recipes for this kind of frosting before but had never made it. It is a new favorite for my family. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have made this cake countless times, and it is absolutely the best chocolate cake I've ever had. I have never made the icing; I usually top it with cream cheese frosting. This cake is at its best when you make it a day ahead in order to bring out its delicious moistness 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#We love this cake, I go back to this recipe quite a bit. And the icing is so tasty! If I had to choose between this and a buttercream I'd choose this one always. Not so sweet. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I thought that the batter was deliciouse but the final product had a flour taste that was not very good. The frosting was also disappointing.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#A very moist cake. I put sliced strawberries in between the layers, topped it with whole strawberries and drizzled it with chocolate.I would prefer a buttercream frosting over this one.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#this smells so good and taste so good
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#wow this was more than words can describe fantastic. Very mosit cake and the icing was super super good
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is the only chocolate cake that I make and have been making it since it first appeared in 1993, it is the best!!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I read other reviews after I wrote my own. Two people asked about the unusual icing recipe. The answers are, yes, it uses flour, and it uses granulated sugar. It does take the 10 minutes to beat the icing. Did you ever wonder how the filling in a commercial filled cookie or cake (like oatmeal cream pies or Devil Dogs) is made? Make this icing and you will see! After I had made this cake with the icing, I read a recipe for whoopie pies. The filling for them is the same recipe as this icing, just a different quantity! I recommend you try the icing! Excellent! So you know how much I like this recipe, I just spent hours trying to find it on this website because I can't find the magazine with the recipe! This is THE chocolate cake! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Ever since I got the magazine in the mail with this recipe in it, this has been my chocolate cake recipe! It is the best! The frosting is different, but a very good different! I've been using this recipe for nearly 20 years! I do not use the coffee, however. I use water in place of the coffee. Oh, and never use sour milk for the milk. It really rose that time! What a mess! If you forget the sugar, you can add it at the end (ask me how I know). The only time this cake was not the right cake was when I was using a special shape cake pan (Scooby Doo), and this cake was too moist for the pan. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake is so yummy and moist. It's the best chocolate cake I've ever made 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#LOVED THIS CAKE!!!!!! This is my new chocolate cake...very moist very good! I was a little worried when it was baking because it formed a wet ring and kind of looked like a doughnut, but turned out just fine when done. I didn't use this icing recipe I used a homemade peanut butter icing instead. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Can someone please tell me if the sugar used in the icing is granulated or powdered?... I've never heard of granulated for icing (unless cooked), but it doesn't specify 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I love this recipe! Cake is moist and flavorful! I have found though that the baking time is off by about 10-15 minutes. I have increased baking time accordingly. For the icing, it calls for 5 Tablespoons of flour, which is used for thickening. The best icing I have ever had. You won't be disappointed. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Awesome cake! This is my most requested cake recipe, especially for birthdays.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This recipe came with my very first Taste of Home magazine. I had looked and looked at that cake and thought to myself that that cake couldn't tastes as good as it looked. Oh, Mother of Pearl I was wrong. Over the top it is. I didn't think my husband would eat it because he can't stand coffee and it has coffee in it, but I was wrong. This is the only chocolate cake they ever ask for. Suits me. It is out of this world fantastic. I have made it over and over again. It is soooooo wonderful. Thanks for this recipe. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake was moist, I'll give it that. But as far as taste goes, the flavor was very lacking. I tasted almost no chocolate, and that was after I added more cocoa than it called for. I would not make this again. To me, a chocolate cake should taste more chocolatey than this cake did. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake is spectacular - the best chocolate cake we've ever eaten. Very moist with that can't get enough taste! No. 1 on our list. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Best ever!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have made this cake ever since it came out in the cookbook back in about 1992. I love it! It is failproof. If you want it to fill a 13 x 9 full, just do one and a half batches of the recipe. After it cools, slice off the extra (it is the best part!) and then turn the cake out onto the cooling rack.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I found this recipe in the premiere edition of Taste of Home. It has been our family's traditional birthday cake ever since, made for every family member. Taste's best after it's been refrigerated. Beware this cake can be addicting! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#My family and friends LOVE this cake! I saw this recipe when TOH first came out almost 20yrs ago, I've been making this cake ever since. I make a lot of cakes, but this is the one EVERYONE asks for and there is never any leftovers...YUM!! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Excellent. That's all that needs to be said. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Best Chocolate Cake ever.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is by far the best chocolate cake ever! Better than a cake mix!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Wow, was this ever an addicting cake to eat! I couldn't stop eating it! I made it for my daughter's 7th birthday. I made cupcakes & one round cake and doubled the recipe for the frosting because I didn't want to run out. It was perfect! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#THE best chocolate cake recipe I have ever made. I use to only make it for special occations but they are far and few so now I make it regularly. Very moist for days and the frosting isn't sickly sweet. A keeper.... 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I've made this special cake for many family birthdays. My husband loves the frosting and it looks beautiful on the table! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is THE chocolate cake recipe in our house. We love it both plain and or with the frosting. We like the frosting because it's not overly sweet as so many frostings tend to be. Our older son insisted on this cake for every birthday when he was little. A surefire winner! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Ever since receiving the first edition of Taste of Home, I have been making this cake. My daughter who is now 28 years old has requested it for every birthday since she was little. I don't even bother looking at other chocolate cake recipes. They can't compete. This is THE chocolate cake (and icing) for me and my family. Delightful! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is the greastest chocolate cake I've ever had. When I was very young, my mom received the premiere issue of TOH. We made this cake, and I've been making it ever since. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have made this recipe for family birthday parties since my first issue of Taste of Home and it turns out everytime--moist--chocolately and rave reviews!! I always use 8 in. layer pans and make a half dozen cupcakes for later. I noticed that today when I went to make it for my best girlfriend's birthday lunch tomorrow, that I couldn't find my recipe due to my kitchen under renovation--when I went on the TOH website the cake didn't turn up--so FINALLY at 3:30 pm found it in a box--and made it---turned out perfect! Once more!!! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#So good! I had rave reviews after taking to work for a birthday.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have made this cake for years! We love it and it is a staple for our birthday cakes. I sometimes try other recipes, but this is the best.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This was the very first recipe I ever made from Taste of Home, and I've lost count of how many times I've made it since. I've tied many, many chocolate cake recipes and none can compare to this one. As a bonus, it's outrageously easy! I've even baked this in heart-shaped layers and decorated it with rolled fondant (after icing, of course) and fondant roses for a Valentine's treat - its texture is substantial enough to hold up to the fondant.We like this cake best chilled. My husband and I call it Whoopie Pie Cake as we are from Maine, and think that it really captures the flavor of those yummy Maine treats.Personally I usually do bake it at 350, as I've found that at 325 it takes rather a lot longer than 30 minutes, but that may be my oven. At any rate, this is an absolute keeper recipe! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Does Taste of Home not publish negative reviews? This cake was a disaster for me today. I used 9-inch pans and the cake came out over the top and spilled into the oven. I followed the recipe to the letter, but I think it should have been baked at 350 degrees rather than 325 and perhaps part of the batter should have been used for cupcakes as described if one used the 8-inch pans! Too much batter for 9-inch pans.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#The first day I received the Premiere Issue with this recipe, I baked this cake! Now it's my family's favorite chocolate cake and a must for my husband's birthday every year! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is the ONLY chocolate cake recipe my family will allow me to use! THE BEST!!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#We really enjoyed this cake. Very moist and the frosting is light. I did add 1 cup powdered sugar to sweeten the frosting like another person did. And I baked 2 -8 inch and 6 cupcakes. My cakes ran over the sides of the pans. Next time I'll do 9 inch and cupcakes. Very Yummy! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#One of the best cakes I have ever made, when they say moist they mean it! It's a nice moist rich chocolaty delight :-).....A slice of heaven on a plate in my book!!! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This by far my family's favorite cake. Adults and kids love it. It is like a big woopie pie . It is a nice light bbut moist cake. Great 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#We make this cake for my daughter's birthday on New Year day because I didn't have a box mix. This is the best chocolate cake we have ever had, better then any box or bakery cake. The frosting is perfect and not to sweet. I made a double batch of frosting and used all of it on a two layer cake. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Not a big fan of chocolate cake, but this one always makes me go back for seconds!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Excellent recipe; it's just as moist as a box mix. I made the cake with whole wheat flour and couldn't tell the difference! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have been making this cake for at least 20 years. My children, now grown, have never asked for any other for their birthdays.It was originally in the Taste of Home magazine.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have been carrying this recipe around since I found it in an issue of the Taste of Home Magazine that is dated 1993. I have shared it with everyone that has asked for a Moist Chocolate Cake. And the Icing Recipe that is with this cake is Excellent! It is NOT sweet at all. You can actually eat the whole piece of cake without scraping the icing off due to heavy sweetness. I truely believe that every cook out there should have a copy of this recipe for it is the BEST.Barb Smith
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake is deliscous! It melts in your mouth :) The icing is good but I doctored it a little. After about 8 minutes of beating, I added 1 cup of powdered sugar to sweeten.
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#Any tips for high altitude? I'm at 7000 feet and my cakes overflowed into my oven, then sunk dramatically in the center. They taste good, but could have turned out a lot better. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake is fabulous! Very moist with lots of chocolate flavor. The icing is really light and has a wonderful taste, not overly sweet. Definitely a keeper recipe!Trish D 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made only the cake portion of this recipe and it is truly spectacular! Very moist and flavorful. Not one of those sickeningly sweet cakes. I will be using this recipe again!
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#ABSOLUTELY DELCIOUS! And so easy to make! I just made it this afternoon with my kids, and it is a HUGE hit. I used the Vanilla Frosting Recipe from TOH because I needed something simple for the kids to help me with. Thank you so much for sharing! 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake is the best moist chocolate cake I've ever tasted. I have had nothing but praises from all those who have tasted it & numerous requests for the recipe. 
Moist Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is absolutely the best chocolate cake of all! I have made this cake many, many times over the years and have yet to find one that could top it! Very rich and moist.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I have made this several times and my wife and I love it. Recently my wife is on a special diet and has lost a lot of weight. Because of this diet, she cannot use crackers or breadcrumbs. Her weight loss coach told her to use pork rinds/Chicharones as a binder. I used that and it did not affect the taste at all. She also cannot use the topping, so she has special ketchup that her coach told her to use.
Mom's Meat Loaf#9#0#I liked this recipe quite a bit. The one thing I would change is the amount of brown sugar. I have a real sweet tooth, but this seemed like a bit too much sugar to me (especially for an entree). Next time, I will likely reduce the amount of brown sugar by half. But overall - a very good meal loaf!  
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#The best meat loaf recipe! The sauce for the top really makes it special! I will make it again!
Mom's Meat Loaf#6#2#Try catsup with horseradish. Family favorite.
Mom's Meat Loaf#6#1#I used crushed cheez-its instead of saltines & sloppy joe sauce for the top.
Mom's Meat Loaf#2#13#I usually just use ketchup for the topping. Too much sugar in one's diet isn't very good. The recipe is great. I give it 3 stars. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#8#5#I think many of us take a recipe and add/change things to make it our own. I have never had very good luck making meatloaf. It was either way too dense or it would fall apart. This recipe is absolutely fantastic! I did, however, add/change a couple of things. A while back I ordered tomato powder from the Spice House. I always forget that I have it. But I saw it in the refrigerator (keeps it from getting hard as a rock), and figured I'd add it in to the ground beef. I used about a tablespoon. I suppose you could always use a couple of tablespoons of the double concentrated tomato paste that comes in a tube. I also used mostly 90/10 ground beef, but figured I'd add some 80/20 in for some extra moisture (and obviously more fat). My mom always used Ritz crackers for meatloaf or meatballs....so I combined Ritz crackers and saltines...not really sure it made a difference. Then I added about one or two teaspoons of Kitchen Bouquet to the mixture. I'm not sure if my changes made any difference at all from the original recipe, but this was absolutely the best meatloaf I have ever eaten. My 29 year old son, asked me if it was any good, and I told him to taste it and let me know. He called from the kitchen and said, Dad, this is the BEST meatloaf! What the world did you put in this? 
Mom's Meat Loaf#9#13#Almost all meatloaf recipes lack one thing that will take it to the next level. That is one medium grated carrot.
Mom's Meat Loaf#9#0#OMG This recipe reminds me of my mom's! It's so moist and seasoned so well! I just finished the last bite! Thank you for this delicious- ness!
Mom's Meat Loaf#15#2#Family's favorite recipe. Is easy to put together, and the leftovers make great meatloaf sandwiches. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#6#6#Fabulous meatloaf. The only tweaks I made was to add 1/2 cup A1 steak sauce and 1/4 cup brown sugar, but I doubled the recipe. Made my top glaze from another 1/2 cup A1 steak sauce and 1/4 cup brown sugar.
Mom's Meat Loaf#22#15#I had never made a meatloaf before but decided to make one using this recipe with a couple small modifications. I only used 1/3 cup of milk, I used Panko bread crumbs instead of crackers and I baked it for 75 minutes. It came out absolutely fantastic.
Mom's Meat Loaf#33#4#I started making this recipe years ago when I was about 14 years old my grandmother gifted me a taste of home recipe book and I found this recipe. After I made it the first time it the first time for my parents and brother it was a hit. Now I make it for my husband and five daughters! Such a wonderful recipe and turns out delicious every time!
Mom's Meat Loaf#13#62#this was the worst meat loaf ,there was no taste and it was too runny will never make again
Mom's Meat Loaf#10#11#Loved this recipe. To cut calories, I didn't put any sauce on until the very end and only used a mixture of 1/4 cup BBQ sauce, 1/8 cup ketchup, and a T. of mustard. Still very moist. Used 1/2 pork sausage and 1/2 beef. I didn't have sage in the house so I skipped that. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#4#0#We loved this meatloaf recipe! Great flavor and taught me how to make it moist while still holding together! I threw some mushrooms on top and some cheddar cheese.
Mom's Meat Loaf#24#9#Amazingly easy to prepare. First, I cook on auto pilot. This means I end up with a modified recipe, bu it turned out perfect and delicious. Plus, I have never made meatloaf without tomato sauce. I choose this recipe as I could not bare making my mom's fabulous recipe today. She was a wonderful cook. It's almost Mother's Day and I miss her every day. I find healing though cooking and am even inspired by asking my 91 year old dad to share his own cooking tips with me. May will be a celebration by sharing with my family some of Mom's favorite dishes.
Mom's Meat Loaf#7#1#I have five kids of varying ages and this is something they all love. I've made it for guests before thinking it may be too simple for a company meal, but everyone left raving about it. All asked for the recipe. This one is a definite winner!
Mom's Meat Loaf#12#7#I don't know how many meatloafs I've made over the years, or how many different versions I've tried, but this is my very favorite. I make a couple of changes, though. I use 2 pounds of ground beef (or meatloaf mix; that's good, too). Otherwise, it turns out too loose for our taste. I grate the onion instead of chopping it. That way, its taste is distributed evenly throughout the loaf. And finally, instead of one free-form loaf in the middle of my 13 x 9 pyrex pan, I make two. That way, there's more surface to be covered with the sauce, and we just like it better that way. Leftovers make awesome sandwiches, too! Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Michelle Beran! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#2#0#Delicious! Next time though I'll follow the advice of a previous review and add the Worcestershire sauce to the meatloaf and skip the sauce. My family only likes a little sauce on top and this recipe made way more than we needed. Instead I'll just add a little ketchup to the top before cooking. I used 2.25 pounds of ground beef instead of 1.5 pounds because that's how it was packaged and I didn't have a need to save a small amount. It still turned out fantastic. Much better than using the meatloaf seasoning packet like I've always done before. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#21#0#I have 4 very very picky kids the oldest is 13. They pretty much all 4 live on pizza every day. No kidding! Until,!!!! I made this and made all 4 of them at least try it. Guess what? I am now making it at least once a week and all 4 of them absolutely love it so I've been doubling everything and they eat every last bit of it at least by the next evening. All 4 kids and myself would like to thank you for this wonderful meatloaf. It's a huge hit in our home. God bless. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#7#2#This is very similar to my mother's with a couple of small exceptions. She added the Worcestershire sauce to the meatloaf and then just used ketchup to top it. I don't think I would miss the brown sugar. Delicious and thank you for sharing your version!
Mom's Meat Loaf#9#1#Never made a decent meatloaf, which family didn't care for anyway. Found this recipe in Taste of Home's Copycat Favorites book. BINGO! Didn't change a thing and has now become a favorite. I am feeling victorian' !
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#1#Very similar to my mom's meatloaf. Though we use Ritz crackers, a couple eggs and the topping is brown sugar, ketchup, mustard, worcestershire sauce. I do like the comment to wet d oi wn your crumbs prior to adding to the meat mix. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#1#This is basically the recipe I've used for many years, minus the sage (which I only like in cornbread dressing). I like to soak the crackers in the milk until they are soft before adding to the meat. You can also add chopped bell pepper for extra flavor. The only meatloaf recipe I'll ever use.
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#0#Instead of baking in the oven, I cooked it on my smoker. We all loved it.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I've been making this recipe for years and we love it! I substitute plain bread crumbs for the saltines, but it is great either way!! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#My mom always made her meatloaf with 80/20 ground beef
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Tried this recipe last year and we love it! Makes tasty sandwiches the next day too!
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#0#I have always loved meat loaf but didn't know how much till I tried this recipe. It is now my go to meat loaf recipe. LOVE IT!!!!
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#1#My husband and kids loved this meatloaf! This recipe is a keeper!
Mom's Meat Loaf#2#7#Trying to eat healthier, used ground turkey - also added minced garlic, good bread crumbs, and chili sauce.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#This is always a hit! My husband devours this meatloaf! He even admitted that after all the years of loving his mom's meatloaf, he thinks this is even better! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#2#1#margycravath@gmail.com Great recipe..I added a touch of prepared mustard and a capsule apple cider vinegar to ketchup
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#I'm not a big fan of meatloaf, but this was very good. Made it exact, but will cut back on the milk next time. Great comfort meal, thanks Michelle 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#6#I tried this recipe without the milk, onion and saltines....used italian bread crumbs for the saltines...a huge hit with my husband and I. Can't wait to make it again and tweak it a bit! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#2#I learned this from my mom, too. The brown sugar is that secret ingredient that is the game changer. I try to stay away from sugar but meat loaf without it is just meh 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#2#It's goooood! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#3#1#I got this from you magazine several years ago. First of all it is delicious ! Several homes I've brought it to LOVE it. At holiday time I am asked to bring it for our main recipe. It's just the best recipe you will ever have. It's also very easy to make. You owe it to yourself and family and friends to try this one!
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#6#I always add diced bell peppers to my meatloaf. And several slices of bread. Crackers would add to much salt.
Mom's Meat Loaf#2#1#I love this meatloaf. Very flavorful, and the leftovers are great as well. This one's definitely a keeper! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#2#1#I have never been a fan of meatloaf either, but this recipe won me over! The only change I made was omitting the sage. The meatloaf came out moist and flavorful! My kids loved it and the leftovers didn't last very long. This is now my'go to' recipe when my husband requests meatloaf from now on! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#8#1#Hello.....just recently made your meatloaf but it didn't turn out. I followed the directions exactly but it seemed overly moist when trying to form into the loaf. It actually fell apart during cooking. Any suggestions?? Smelled wonderful and tasted great but would want it to hold its shape to be able to slice for presentation and sandwiches for leftovers. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#1#I made a meatloaf for my sweeties sister - she loves meatloaf, him, not so much. I had some caramelized onions left over from something else and decided to put them in a small portion of the meatloaf mix for just him. Then, I topped it with bar-b-que sauce. I lined the loaf pan with foil and made a separate section for his meatloaf by making a foil partition. He loved it! They will be getting both now, she loved this recipe:)
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Yummy! A simple and delicious meatloaf. Having fewer veggies in the recipe makes for a denser meatloaf. So it makes it easier to cut into slices for sandwiches.
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#0#I find best meatloaf is a combination of ground beef, pork, and veal.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#I have made this a few times, although I always halve the recipe as there are only two of us eating it. It is a very nice meatloaf, being easy to make and very tasty. Today I used the ground veal that I got on sale at the store and it was just as tasty as the ground beef. I think you would use whatever ground meat you have on hand.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#The best meatloaf I have ever had!
Mom's Meat Loaf#2#1#We love this recipe so much that we had it for a Christmas party. It was a big hit. Reqested recipe.
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#5#I use 2 lbs ground beef and 12 ozs of Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage. No brown sugar and 1 Chopped green pepper. Also, 1 can of evaporated milk and a whole sleeve of crackers. The sausage and green pepper takes it to another level. Still use the sage seasoning and one8 oz of tomato sauce instead of catsup. Use half in the meatloaf and half as the topping.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This is my favorite recipe but instead of the crackers I'll use bread crumbs
Mom's Meat Loaf#3#5#I agree with Randall. I made it today and followed recipe exactly as said. Sorry, but this is the worst meatloaf I ever made. I landed up giving it to my cats!
Mom's Meat Loaf#2#1#The blending is great. The ketchup and brown sugar combo topping is like having candy for diner. I suggest using half a ketchup/Worcestershire in the blend and the rest as the topping . No brown sugar!!!!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#2#I made this meatloaf today and it turned out awesome. I used chicken stock instead of milk, and added more saltine crackers (I used a whole sleeve). At the end of 60 minutes, I turned the oven off, opened the oven door and let it sit there for another hour. Meatloaf was juicy and delicious. I also used less brown sugar in the recipe.,
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#2#Made this last night, OMG, it is the best. I must say I did make some changes, but my hubby has always liked my usual meatloaf, but he loves this one. I replaced the milk with a can of golden mushroom soup, packet of Lipton onion soup, deleted the sage, not big sage fans, The amount of cracker crumbs had to increased. I used almost a full sleeve of crackers and probably could have been ok with the whole sleeve. It is a winner in our book.
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#9#My wife and I made this just by the recipe and it was nasty. Thought we had made a mistake so we did it again. This is the worse tasting meat loafs I have ever tasted. I'll never make it again. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#Very good recipe, my go to. I read all the comments and altered it like this:I used 80/20 ground, so I doubled the cracker to 1 1/2 cups Ritz, and I used 1/2 cup cream instead of milk to help make it firmer. It's important to let the meatloaf rest 10 minutes before serving.I also altered the topping, adding prepared mustard, using less ketchup, and adding less brown sugar.Came out great. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Wonderful meat loaf recipe! The saltines, milk and eggs make it super tender and the sage doesn't overpower at all....just adds a nice earthy warmth to it. The sauce was a bit too sweet for us, so next time I'll cut back on the brown sugar. But this is a great meatloaf, and something I'll definitely make again!Volunteer Field Editor 
Mom's Meat Loaf#2#1#I was never a meatloaf fan, but I substitute Ritz crackers and we love this recipe. My 4 year old son cried when I told him I was making meatloaf.. he ate 4 helpings and now both him and his dad ask for this ATLEAST once a week. The sauce makes it perfect!! And it's so simple. Definitely a staple in our house! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Doubled the recipe and made 2 I did not make the sauce just used ketchup straight from the bottle. There was none left and everyone loved it. Thanks for the recipe.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#Great meatloaf recipe, the sage gives a special touch. I love the sauce on the side to use as much as desired.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#Switched milk with tomato sauce and it was amazing!My very picky family loves it and ask for it often ?
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#I don't even like meatloaf but this was amazing!!! Kids loved it too. My daughter who is very picky was nibbling at it all night. Very moist and the sauce was wonderful! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#3#Sugar in a beef meatloaf just doesn't sound right. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#0#Too sweet. Maybe cut the brown sugar in half? Also think it needs more crackers as the texture was sloppy (basically fell apart as soon as I lifted it out).I absolutely hated it but my wife liked it. I'd give it a ZERO, she gave it a 4...so my rating is half way between. To each their own. Sorry for her but since I'm the cook, I won't be making this again. If you like a sweeter tasting meatloaf, this is the one for you. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This is hands down the best meatloaf I have ever eaten..My 13 year old grandson loved it, what better compliment than that!! There was enough for dinner and leftover for hot meatloaf sandwiches..the sweet and sour sauce is amazing!!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#2#I loved this meatloaf! I would have given this a 5 star however, My family did not like the barbecue sauce.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Love this recipe! I cook it in the crock pot! I have substituted venison for the ground beef.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Very good and simple recipe. It's a go to at our house! Husband loves making meatloaf sandwiches the next day. Been making this for years and everyone always raves about it! We love the sauce! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This meat loaf is moist and flavorful. Another keeper!!
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#1#I have made this hundreds of times. Everyone raves about it. I have modified it sometimes. Sometimes I add celery. I often use 1#hamburg and 1/2#lean ground pork. I put chopped green peppers in occasionally and used it to stuff green peppers. I think is the sauce that people really like. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#3#****20 YEARS OF PROOF****Being a working mom I was looking for a meatloaf my whole family would LOVE...I made 6 different meatloafs one day and had the family try all. Hands down this was there favorite. My kids come home and still want this over almost anything else I make. One of there favorite foods and warm family memories go with this meal. I now make this for my grandkids, and for the stubborn eaters I now put chopped or mashed veggies in. I Cover with part of sauce not real heavy, then put the rest in a bowl warm for those who like more. Try with your family and you will have a new easy family favorite!!!!!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#This is a great recipe-I no longer use any other. I substitute panko for saltines and since my family doesn't love sage in beef I substitute granulated garlic. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#This is a test comment.
Mom's Meat Loaf#2#1#Use ground chuck and a half pound of ground pork and also panko bread crumbs, no sugar or salt. Use some diced green pepper and onion for added background flavor. Maybe a couple of bacon strips on top. Best ever. And better meatloaf sandwiches the next day. (For Diabetes person).
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#0#botanner, then tweek the recipe to cut down the salt.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#Absolutely yummy, this is a keeper.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#I have made this many times. We love it. I cut the salt to 1/4 tsp or omit altogether. I use bread crumbs in place of crackers. I shape it to fit my crockpot, place it on aluminum foil with holes poked in it to release the fat, put it on a rack or a couple of jar covers side-by-side and cook it on low for 4-5 hours. Pour the sauce on the top of the loaf for the last 30-45 minutes. This is delicious!
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#2#The sauce I knew would be too sweet for our taste. I didn't use any of the brown sugar, and instead used less milk and a little ketchup in the meat mixture, and of course on top. I also used more spice, garlic powder, marjoram and a lot of pepper as is our preference. Almost carmelizing the onions is something I've always done, it adds a lot more flavor to the meatloaf. I've never measured the crackers, I just crumble until it looks right :-) This recipe, with my modifications, is how my mom made meatloaf, minus the onions. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#Good recipe, but the sauce was a bit too sweet and tasted more like a barbecue sauce. I would cut the amount of sugar by half next time. I baked mine in muffin tins at 350 for about 30 minutes.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#Delicious! This recipe is good I just changed two little thing. Instead of 1/2c sugar I do 1tbs and The sauce I pore everything on the meatloaf. Made it like this every time including the very first. Love taste of home recipes everything I made was delicious.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#This meatloaf was very good. My whole family loved it, and my husband is not a meatloaf guy . I didn't have any problems with it being dry at all or falling apart. I give it 4 stars only bc it was a little too sweet for me as well. And without the sauce the meat was pretty bland, although my husband liked the fact that the meat wasn't overly seasoned bc the sauce had a great taste. The only thing I may do next time is season the meat a little more and probably not put as much brown sugar. But I wouldn't make many changes bc my family (husband and 2 kids) LOVED IT. I paired it with some mashed potatoes and green beans. Overall a great meal. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#0#I am sorry but this was not good at all. Very dry. We threw what was left in the garbage. Followed the recipe exactly. I have two other go to meatloaf recipes that I will continue to use. What intrigued me was the crackers in it because mine falls apart a lot. I will not make this again. No flavor either, I felt like I was eating dry hamburgers.
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#0#I followed the recipe exactly and I ended up with a sloppy mess. The loaf just fell apart. Also, the sauce is way too sweet.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I have made this in my crockpot for years. Best meatloaf recipe ever. I never liked meatloaf before trying this recipe.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This was really good. My husband was never a huge meatloaf fan but he also gave this 5 stars. I only put in half the brown sugar that the recipe called for because #1) I'm trying to cut down on sugar, and #2) there were a number of reviews saying the sauce was pretty sweet. With half the sugar it still seemed pretty sweet to me. Next time I will put in a quarter of the sugar that the recipe calls for. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#Very good flavor for a traditional meatloaf.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I have made this for many years. It is my family's favorite. Love the sauce on top and having leftovers for sandwiches....though, I have to make 2 to have leftovers! I used Ritz crackers instead of the saltines this time and loved it just as much. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#I was never a meatloaf fan, but reluctantly agreed to make it for my husband after constant requests, I used this recipie and now I LOVE meatloaf. I make it all the time and no matter who is eating they all go back to seconds and there are no leftovers.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#This is delicious! We have made it several times and I doubt we will ever stop.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#Excellent! I made this exactly per the recipe and will be making again for sure. Served oven crispy potatoes.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#Made this for the first last week and have cooked it four times by special requests from family...they all LOVE it...i use 2 pounds of ground beef and increased other ingredients accordingly. Since my family does not like catsup I use Sweet Baby Ray original sauce..this meatloaf is gourmet. I also substitute Saltines in favor of Club or Ritz Crackers. Instead of bulb onion I used about 6 green onions including the green parts. This meatloaf has lots of flavor!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#Love it! I've tried several different meatloaf recipes (my husband loves meatloaf) and this is the one my husband thinks is the absolute best. I've never been much of a meatloaf fan and even I truly enjoy it. The only change I made was to reduce everything by a third since there are only two of us, and we still have leftovers for the next day's lunch (at least he does). 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#My husband loves my meatloaf. But I'm always on the lookout for new recipes and ways to make it. Mine rarely turns out the same two times in a row. But he always loves it.Seeing that this had 5 stars, I decided to try it. I made it exactly as the recipe was written. Yes, it was moist, but it was the most bland, tasteless meatloaf I have ever made. Totally a waste of good ground beef. Sorry, but I won't be making this recipe ever again! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This is my favorite meat loaf recipe!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#Awesome! We really liked this meatloaf recipe. I rarely make meatloaf but this recipe might change that!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#I love it but some times i use Italian bread crumbs instead of saltines
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#1#This is baking in my oven right now, on a rainy, cool Sunday afternoon. I have made this meatloaf many times before.and I think the sage gives this meatloaf the unique flavor. It smells so good baking. I do use reduced sodium crackers, Worcestershire and catsup as a rule in cooking. It is moist and flavorful, served with yams and roasted carrots of many colors. This meal is a winner in our home. Thanks for sharing, Michelle!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#I made this with 93/7 ground beef and skim milk. My husband liked the sauce and also said it was moist and tender but held together nicely. He still prefers his mom's meatloaf recipe. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#Best I have ever had.
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#1#My family loves this recipe. I do not use the sage. I add a little ketchup to the meat mixture just cause I like a little tomatoy inside the loaf. I sometimes poke holes on the loaf so the topping can seep into the loaf.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#I have made this and Easy meatloaf several times. For this recipe, we really like the ketchup mixture topping. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Too much sugar in this recipe, both added and hidden! Try using tomato paste with a little Worchestershire sauce stirred in for your topping with bell pepper rings for garnish (I like the yellow ones). Instead of a runnier sauce you will have a tangier topping that is absorbed into the flavor of the meatloaf in the top layer. Change the saltines to seasoned bread crumbs (Italian or Garlic seasoned), add chopped sundried tomatoes to bring hints of the tomato tang throughout the meatloaf and use chopped sweet Hawaiian onions for a flavor balance.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#if I had ground beef in the house right now I would make this for dinner. it's freezing cold here in Los Angeles California and this sounds like it would warm our hearts &gt; perhaps I'm on my way to the market :))) yep my husband had a Dr apt and took me to grocer. it's in the oven right now made exactly as written. I'll report back.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'DEEEEEEEE-LISH!!!!!!!!!!sgwing &gt; use less what? kittiekatt &gt; all due respect to you as well. my MIL without fail always used crushed saltines for her meatloaf and meatballs, they were always exactly the same and 2 of my favorite meals she made. our kids well, they adored it and her. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#This was very good, but a little too soft for my taste. I think next time I'll use less and see if that might firm it up. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#I had never made meatloaf before and have never cared much for it either, but my husband asked for it one night. This recipe was super easy to make and tasted delicious. My husband loved it and I did too! He especially liked the sauce. I used breadcrumbs in place of crushed saltines. I would highly recommend this recipe!
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#1#I'm a single Dad, who like many people, I'm raising my child on my own. I'll be the first to admit that my cooking skills would make Chef boyardee and Martha Stewart blush in shame. However, last night I tried this Meatloaf and man you should have seen the look on my kids face after her first bite it was worth the time and effort. What topped it off she asked for thirds. Thank you! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This stuff is dope! I almost never eat ground beef, but was looking for something different to make for dinner. Seriously delicious. Made the recipe exactly as written, used the extra sauce too and loved it. Great combination of savoury and sweet. Reminiscent of good Southern bbq. Would gladly make again very soon. Thanks for this scrumptious dish!
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#0#Too sweet, would just use a little ketchup and not add brown sugar or add very little.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#My family really liked this one and while I did too, I think I might tweak it a little. Maybe a little diced green pepper in it or a little more Worcestershire sauce. Definitely a keeper though!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Meatloaf is a family favorite and this is a good one. I usually mix a 1/2 pound of ground pork with 1 pound of ground beef in my meatloaf. Served with some mashed potatoes, this is comfort food at its best.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Great!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#I really enjoyed this recipe. It made a lot of food and tasted great. I served it with mashed potatoes and smothered with brown gravy on top (instead of the reserved sauce) and it was filling and delicious. Perfect for a chilly night. Thanks for the recipe!
Mom's Meat Loaf#2#0#I too have commented repeatedly about the rudeness of the reviewers on this site. I don't see this as much on other cooking sites. Sure hate to try and meet their standards. I appreciate suggestions & honest critiques.. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#2#0#Wow! Delicious! I used thyme instead of sage because I don't care for sage. Put a couple dashes of worcheshire and ketchup in the meat mixture (used 75% lean). Other than that, I followed the recipe. It is sooo juicy and delicious. Served it with baked sweet potatoes. Definitely a keeper!! Thanks :) 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Yummy! I added1/4#of ground sausage everyone raved. I'm not usually a fan of this but it was the best I've had! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#0#I used oatmeal instead of saltines and did not add more salt. The meatloaf was bland without sauce. And I used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar great flavor on sauce. I will follow recipe as is to get the true flavor. And I used a meatloaf mixture instead of all ground beef. I will make recipe again and post another review. Some times it doesn't work when substitutions are made from early on or first time following recipe. My Bad. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I have been making a recipe almost exactly like this for 40 years. The only difference is that I use quick rolled oats instead of saltine crackers and omit the sage, although I will try sage next time just to see if the family likes that spice in the meatloaf. Thanks for sharing. Our mothers before us knew what satisfied at the dinner table, that's why recipes like this are still around, albeit with slight differences. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This is my family's favorite meatloaf recipe. I have been making it for over 15 years. If I try a different recipe, they know it. I believe the sauce is what makes it so good. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Good flavor!
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#0#Donalee2. First of all you don't type in all caps as you are shouting. Secondly and most importantly, why on earth are you reviewing a recipe you haven't even tried. Seriously? 
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#1#This is a good meatloaf recipe. I agree with the others, I wish reviewers would not bombard us with their negative comments. Not all recipies are to everyone's liking, but please be considerate of the submitter and professional about your review 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#There are very few recipes that get this high a rating....agree with 120 out of 125 on this one. Also agree with another reviewer...no need to be SO negative on a recipe. It can be done tastefully if you do not care for it...ie: this has too much salt for me or it is a bit too sweet for my family...
Mom's Meat Loaf#2#0#@Donalee; not that many calories if you exercise a bit during the week. You should wait till Sunday to do your preaching. This is our go to meat loaf recipe except if we use saltines we eliminate the salt. Most of the time we use Italian bread crumbs.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I have been making this for many years. Excellent recipe.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#3#I HAVEN'T TRIED THIS RECIPE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS AN AWFUL LOT OF CALORIES FOR JUST ONE PIECE OF MEATLOAF. THAT IS ALMOST YOUR WHOLE MEAL WORTH OF CALORIES. DONALEE 2 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I've been making this recipe for years (11 ?) and it's one of my go to recipes. The meatloaf is moist and very flavorful! Love, love, love it. And my husband, who grew up having meatloaf, loves it too! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Held form well well and texture good. A little too salty for my taste with saltines and salt. May leave salt out next time
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I made this into a spectacular BACON MEATLOAF!Fantastic base recipe.Changes: I fried 2 chopped thick bacon pieces in a skillet, and blended them with the milk and eggs for 15 seconds. Then, I added spices to the leftover bacon grease in the skillet, and sauteed the onions in it until they started to caramelize--before mixing it all together!Sauteeing the onions and adding the blended bacon gives the meatloaf an extra delicious kick without changing the yummy texture!!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Great meatloaf recipe that was easy to make!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#The worst meatloaf Ive ever tasted. I followed recipe to the T .Yak!!!! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Excellent
Mom's Meat Loaf#2#0#This was excellent!!! Thank you for sharing your mothers recipe with us. Everyone's taste is different and tweeks things the way they want. I think if you do not have something nice to say, you should not say it at all.We LOVED the recipe... 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Delicious!! Can't wait for leftovers. Made mashed potatoes and Pioneers Womans Best Green Beans. Also made a fruit salad. Sooooo good 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#We love this meatloaf, even my meatloaf hating son. The sauce is the winner and is sooo yummy! This isn't to sweet for us, but can easily be adjusted for others who don't like it this sweet. The only adjustment I do is use bread crumbs instead of crackers. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Excellent meat loaf made 8 mini loafs with this recipe added a 1/2 pound of sweet Italian sausage to it will make this again
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#awesome! i used only 1 lb of ground beef. Worked great.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#We loved this even though neither of us are big meat loaf fans. Thinking I had enough ketchup, I ended up having to use about 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce to supplement. Still turned out great!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#OMG best meatloaf ever! Delicious!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I love this meatloaf. Been making similar one for years. Instead of Worcestershire in the topping, I use tabasco. We love the sweet hot taste. Especially good on those sandwiches made from the leftovers. Yum.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#A most excellent meatloaf. My husband claims it's the best he's ever had. I agree. I did substitute 1/2 lb. of mild Italian sausage for the 1/2 lb. of ground beef. I will never use another recipe for meatloaf again. Thanks. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This recipe is the exact same recipe as the one published in the Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook. My version of the cookbook is just over 30 years old.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This was awesome! Made it tonight for dinner and my family loved it. Will definitely make this again.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I wouldn't have thought this would be so different but it was and it was wonderful. My hubby loved it too. I loved it and am making it again today, thanks for sharing the recipe 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Been making meatloaf this way for years, except I use 1 1b ground beef and 1/2 lb ground pork. I add a little minced celery and saute them with the onions and clove of garlic to soften them up as we don't like crunchy veggies in meatloaf. I also use crushed onion crackers vs saltines and add a pinch of dried mustard. Excellent meatloaf. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I've been making this recipe for years.. Won't make any other meatloaf but this one. Plus it's so easy to put together. Everyone loves it just the way it is. Delicious 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I use this same recipe except I exchanged the saltines with oatmeal, and instead of Worcestershire sauce I use mustard, I use ground turkey instead of beef. My family loves it. Thanks for sharing.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#The only thing I changed was half the sugar, I don't like sweet meat. YUM!! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I've been searching for a meatloaf as good as Grams used to be and this is it! Moist flavorful and thumbs up from the whole supper table! Only changes I made were used 2lbs of 80/20 ground beef because that's what I had and omitted the sage because I didn't have any, it still turned out delicious! Thanks for sharing this is a keeper! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#0#Made this for my family tonight & it was a hit! Future husband told me it was better than his mom's :-) super easy to make as well, will definitely be my go to meatloaf recipe! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I used a little bit of ground pork with the ground beef and used poultry seasoning instead of sage... I didn't think such a simple meatloaf recipe would come out so simply DELICIOUS!!! So much more easier than the meatloaf I usually make, this is ridiculously good!!! My family loved it!! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I have been using this meatloaf recipe for almost 17 years now, and there are never any leftovers!!! I have played with it some over the years and it can be as sweet as you want it to be or just use less of the brown sugar. My family loves this recipe, thank you for sharing.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Awful to sweet
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I have made this recipe for several years! sometimes I add grated cheese inside. sometimes I make into about 7 or 8 small loaves and bake about 45 minutes when I'm in a hurry. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#3#0#I have made this meatloaf for years. I have 5 boys and double the recipe. We never have leftovers! I also made this for my parents 50th wedding anniversary party (50 people) everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. This is the best meatloaf ever. Would not understand how someone would not like it.
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#0#Really good!!!! I didn't have any cracker's so I used breadcrumbs, also only one egg. Turned out GREAT 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This is very tasty! We both loved it. I used club crackers in place of saltines, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, minced garlic cloves (2-3) and used 2 to 2-1/2 lbs meatloaf mix and 1 lb 80/20 ground beef. I have tried so many recipes for meatloaf but this is my go to now.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#1#This was AWFUL!!! My husband loves meatloaf so I thought I would give this recipe a go. I couldn't finish my meal & he proceeded to throw away the leftovers. Thanks for the $12 waste!!! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#To'buddystar' - rubbed sage is just crushed sage that is rubbed between your fingers and then added to your mix. This is a very good recipe, but I omit the sage; but at times I will add some chopped green pepper. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This was a pretty good meatloaf. I usually don't like putting raw onion in meatloaf (want to saute it) but this came out really well. Will definitely make it again. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Excellent
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#My husband loves meatloaf, this is the first one I have made that his loves
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I've made this meat loaf several time & never have any left over's.. If I don't have crackers I use oatmeal or break up bread & add a little garlic salt..I add ketchup in meat & top off with sugar & ketchup on top & bake. .very good ! ***** 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#What is rubbed sage? 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I did make some alterations to this recipe, first change was I used Almond milk (used Original, that is what I had on hand) because I have a son highly allergic to dairy milk, then the 2nd change is that I added about 1/4 cup of A1 sauce to the ketchup mixture to add a little more of a kick.I absolutely love the way it turned out. If you need to substitute the milk because of allergies, this is a great recipe.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#My husband and I have been together for 11 years and I have only made meatloaf once or twice. He loves meatloaf, but I hate it...until now. The recipe is simple to make and full of flavor. My husband requested that I make it once a week. I also cooked this recipe for a family get-together and everyone kept telling me how good it was! Next day leftovers are amazing too.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I love this recipe.... I accidentally added all ingredients together......topping and all. It was too moist but my family loved it. Next time I still put all ingredients together.....just cut back on the ketchup. The flavor were great together... Brown sugar, sage and ketchup. It is our family favorite. Out of mistakes comes something awesome.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Tasted just like my mother mae it. Good memory
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I just made this today and it came out perfect! I will never need to try another meatloaf recipe. My husband loved it! This is my first review...I joined just to tell you how good this meatloaf and sauce was. Thanks for sharing it.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Delicious! Made this for the first time today (doubled the recipe) and my husband said he could eat an entire loaf himself. My 11 year old son was amazed about how much he liked it . In fact, he said, ...Mom, I want you to make that meatloaf for my birthday! For the sauce, I didn't have ketchup, so I used tomato sauce instead and cooked the sauce for a few minutes on the stove to thicken it a bit before spreading on the meatloaf. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This is a delicious tender meatloaf. I am not a fan of ketchup on meatloaf but loved this one-the brown sugar and worcestershire sauce make all the difference. Its our family's favorite meatloaf recipe. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I have tried so many good meatloaf recipes, but this one is soooo delicious!!! I will definitely be making this one more often. So easy and the house smells wonderful while it's cooking! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This is a yummy classic meat loaf recipe. Who doesn't love a classic meat loaf?! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This meatloaf is out of this world! I did use breadcrumbs instead of saltines since I didn't have any in the house and it still came out beautifully. I will make this again and again for my friends and family! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This was SOO good and so easy! First time I've ever made meatloaf and it came out excellent. Can't wait to make it again. Oh and i doubled the Worcestershire bc we love it so much haha 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Very easy to make and will definitely make it again. It makes a lot of sauce for the top, so the second time I made it, I cut the sauce part in half and still had plenty for the top of the meatloaf.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#So delicious made with ground turkey! I also placed some sliced pickled jalapenos on the meatloaf before pouring on the sauce! YUM!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I made this meatloaf recipe (times 2) and some mac'n' cheese to send to two different families who are coping with sick loved ones. I was a little nervous because I hadn't made it before. I cut it into nice slices before packaging it up for sending, which allowed me to taste a slice first. It was delicious! Both families prefer simple, home-cooked foods and this was just the ticket. When I told my sister about the recipe, she reminded me that our Mom used to use crumbled saltines in her meatloaf way back when...! I only made a couple of slight variations to the recipe here. I used 2 lbs of ground round and I added about 1/3 of a packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix to the recipe (something my Mom always used in meatloaf. I also only made up a half-quantity of the topping sauce because I didn't send any with the meatloaf for serving. I kept a couple slices behind for dinner that night and my husband asked for seconds (there weren't any!). He doesn't even usually like meatloaf! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I've been making this recipe for years, and everyone loves it. It's easy, uses ingredients I usually have on hand, and is great left over. The only thing I change is that I usually add either fresh garlic or garlic powder. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This is my most requested dish. When I tell everyone I am making meatloaf the first time they are not so excited but once they eat it they are mad at me if I dont invite them over when I make it.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Great!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I always cut the topping down by half because I've found it to be more than enough to cover the meatloaf and still leave some extra for a topping after it cooks.Also, since I usually don't have sage handy, I substitute 1/4 tsp. thyme, 1/4 tsp. oregano, and a few pinches of dried parsley.Oh, and the more onion, the better! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Excellent meat loaf recipe. I made a few adjustments to sub for ingredients I had on hand: garlic & herb breadcrumbs for saltines; garlic powder for sage; honey bbq sauce for ketchup. Also added bacon strips to the top before backing. Both my husband and seven year old love it!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Great recipe for a basic meatloaf. I used 2#hamburger and increased the other ingredients a little. I made 2 small loaves, and poured all of the sauce on top before I baked them. My family thought this was delicious. I'll definitely make this again. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I served this at a dinner party and everyone loved it! It was the best meat loaf I have ever eaten! I don't think there was any left over. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I added some diced celery and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and substituted thyme for the sage (because I didn't have any sage). It was very tasty and I will make it again. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This meatloaf is the best I've ever had. I made it one night, my mother doesn't even like meatloaf....but she loves this one! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#It was very tasty.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I made this for dinner tonight. It was easy and perfectly done. All my family (even my 3 picky eating kids) loved it. I will definitely add this to my weekly recipes. :)
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This was a hit with my picky eaters! Will definitely make this again.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Fantastic recipe. Definitely a keeper.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Delicious. I added garlic powder and dried thyme. The sauce on top makes it special.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Moist and very tasty. It makes a lot of sauce, so I cut the sauce portion of it in half and still had plenty of sauce. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Good meatloaf! My husband said it reminds him of his mother's meatloaf. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Very good and very tasty. I changed a little bit by replacing some of the crumbs with bran and added garlic.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Excellent. Just the right size for two people.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#YUM YUM YUMMY Will make again, I also didn't have an onion on hand so we used dried minced onions that you get off the spice aisle(The conversions were on our bottle). Great to make if you have are running low on ingredients to make most other ground beef recipes :D 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#my this meatloaf is one my whole family loves. I made some gravy from the pan drippings for the mashed potatoes. yummy!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I have made a lot of meat loaf recipes but this is by far my favorite. My family loves it just as much as I do. It's so full of flavor. I have made this meat loaf many times and never get tired of it. 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This is a great recipe and the only meat loaf recipe I use. We like the use of sage and the flavor it gives. Makes a wonderful sandwich from leftovers.
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#0#I had been looking for a great meatloaf recipe and bought the magazine specifically for this recipe. I have made this meatloaf several times, and I absolutely love it. I add in about 1/16 tsp of dry mustard, and as I don't like ketchup, I substitute BBQ sauce, and it works great! The meatloaf is tender and very flavourful. Also, because I'm single, I actually double the recipe and make two loaves, slice them after cooling, and freeze into individual portions. I generally have some at least once a week - it's that good!! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Not my husband nor myself cared for meatloaf until I tried this recipe. Now it is a favorite dish! I have made this meatloaf for company many times, and EVERYONE likes it. I break up the brown sugar and warm the ketchup...that seems to help the sauce mix better.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Husband loved it
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I have made this more times than I can count and it is always delicious. I double the Worcesteshire sauce for added flavor.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Was told to put this meatloaf in the rotation for dinner.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I took out the sage and worst. sauce I have picky eaters to feed. I also cut the ketchup to 1/4 and I glazed it after 30 mins it was so good I half wished I made more. It was soooo good. I served it with scalloped potatoes, and steamed carrots and corn, and a salad with red onion, cucumbers, mushrooms, grated cheddar cheese, and home made ranch dressing.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#made 1/2 recipe, put in buttered loaf pan.Excellent
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#A true favorite of my husbands! He loves the sauce.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I did not like meat loaf or meatballs until I tried this recipe. I make this quite often and just love it!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#So easy to make and the glaze is delicious!
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#0#This is the best meatloaf ever. I've been using this recipe since its publication. I gave the recipe to a co-worker who could not find a meatloaf recipe that her kids would eat and she ended up making it three times that first week (at the kids request). 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This is the only meat loaf I ever use anymore. Have made it dozens of times, not only for family but for special guests, and people go back for seconds.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and my family thoroughly enjoyed it.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This recipe was quite easy. Everything was mixed in one bowl so clean up was minimal. It has a sweet and tangy flavor. Very good.
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#It's the topping that for me really makes this recipe - I use it all the time, even on top of other meatloaf recipes. Much better than ketchup! 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I started making this recipe when it was first published in TOH and my family LOVES it. They will not let me make meatloaf with any other recipe!
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I love this recipe, in fact I have shared this with many of my family members who rave about it too! My youngest son who is 8 requests this one often!Lara
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#This recipe has been a hit in our home since publication. The only change I have made is we omit the sage.
Mom's Meat Loaf#1#0#Simple... moist... tasty... meatloaf... Also, recommend meat mixture for italian meatballs... Dott
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#I had prepared this meatloaf when it first was featured in Taste of Home! I did make the following adjustments: I used ITALIAN bread crumbs, 1 onion, chopped, 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp. pepper, and 1 cup of Barbecue sauce at that time since I didn't have the ingredients to make regular BBQ sauce! I'd used a meatloaf pan to bake this meatloaf! I would probably omit the brown sugar in this sauce if I choose to use prepared BBQ sauce and I'd probably omit the Worcestershire sauce since BBQ sauce has all the additions in it already! As I recall, this meatloaf was really good! Thank you for sharing it with Taste of Home! delowenstein 
Mom's Meat Loaf#0#0#great recipe, my picky eaters ate it all up!
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This was a wonderful cake! I say was since it didn't last the weekend! I split the cake batter into two round 9 inch springform pans and used a 15 oz can of mandarin oranges (all the store had at the time) and it produced a moist cake that was light but paired well with the frosting. I had enough frosting left over (my household prefers a lightly frosted cake) to do a five cup salad variation for dessert as well! Will make this again and again!! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#2#1#I have been making this recipe for years! It is my mother in law's recipe and one of my favorites. She calls it Orange Pineapple Sunshine Cake and one of my good friends calls it Pig Lickin' Good Cake. It is so good and very easy to make. Also you can keep the ingredients on hand for a quick dessert to take to a potluck or just for company!
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#That looks quite good for our restricted diets! Thanks for the recipe.
Pineapple Orange Cake#9#3#My husband's Uncle Wally introduced us to Pig Pickin' Cake over 30 years ago. He explained that it's called a Pig Pickin' Cake because it was the traditional dish brought to a pig picking in his neck of North Carolina- a pig picking being a neighborhood event that follows a pig roasting: After the pig is roasted, the women get together to pick and shred the meat from the carcass, for the making of traditional Carolina BBQ. Our family's version includes a golden butter cake mix (box), 1/2c oil, the fruit from acan of mandarins and 4T of the juice, and 3 whole eggs. The frosting is 20can of crushed pineapple- not drained- with 1 box instant vanilla pudding mixed in. After about 5 mins, fold the whipped topping (12oz) into the pudding/pineapple. I have made this as a sheet cake, 2 layer cake, cupcakes, or in a springform cut into 3 layers. Always delicious, and one of my very favorite desserts! Thanks Uncle Wally, miss you! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#15#1#Here in the South, this little gem is known as a Pig Pickin' Cake. If you're super health conscious, you can certainly make it according to this recipe, but we like it a tiny bit more indulgent in my house. We use the whole eggs (indicated on the cake mix), canola oil instead of applesauce for the cake itself, and regular pudding mix and whipped topping for the frosting. We also add coconut and orange extract to the frosting mixture. It's delicious and a hit every time! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#11#14#Have people now days become so lazy that they can't beaten sweetened heavy cream and use it in recipes that call for frozen whipped topping? The quality, flavor and comfort factor is so much better. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#3#Recipe says add whipping cream, but ingredients doesn't have any! Ant advice 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Delicious recipe. Cooling and light. If you had a dry cake more than likely it was beating the egg whites too long which gives a dry product. Thanks for this keeper!
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#My Polish Granny made this for years from scratch...I would like the try this quicker version. Than compare.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#A dear friend made this for us for our anniversary. I had to have the recipe too because it's so delicious. And it is simple to make! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#4#1#So I want to make this for Easter. I just use the cake mix and follow the directions correct? Not the directions on the cake box.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I have made this cake following the recipe many times ... it's perfection. Every time there's a potluck or treats taken to work I am told that I have to bring this cake, it's so light and tasty my workmates call it the sunshine cake. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#1#0#Made this cake yesterday and it's half gone already, just two people eating. Followed recipe and it came out perfect. I am curious as to why the name change from Pig Picking Cake to Pineapple Orange Cake . I sense a bit of PCness going on. As for the review from momof3 re: pudding size, I used the 1oz. box called for so I don't know where the claim of typo error comes from. Anyway, follow the recipe and you'll have a wonderful dessert. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#SOUNDZ SO DELISH!!!!!! ?? IT!!!
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#3#It's a toss up between a 2&3. I was not impressed w this cake at all. I thought it was dry and did not taste orange at all. The pudding size is a typo too. This recipe has potential and I will remake it but not without making my own tweaks to improve it to my own liking. Topping was great I have made the same topping using coconut cream pudding and pineapple!! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I have been making this cake for about 20 yrs. and I know it as the Pineapple Dream Cake, I bake it in 2 round layers and have always drained the crushed pineapple for the icing. It has always been a big favorite of my family & friends and since moving to SC it has become a favorite of my neighbors. Love it
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This cake is alway a big hit and so easy to make. Best of all it is semi healthy!We love it and I am always giving out the recipe. Has such wonderful flavor it is hard to have just one piece.
Pineapple Orange Cake#2#0#I wanted to make this cake for a long time. However, i can't eat gluten so I was dragging my feet. Pilsbury recently came out with a gluten free yellow cake mix that is made in a 9x13 pan so I figured I would give it a try. First of all let me say that the cake baked up fabulously. In fact I followed the cake recipe only changing to a gluten free cake mix. I did make the frosting with a 12 oz. size whipped cream. I had some left over and and figured why not. This cake was so moist and delicious. Even better the second day. If you need to eat gluten free go ahead and make this cake. I know I will make this cake again and again. Next time I think I will put some maraschino cherries on top. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#2#0#I made this cake for a Memorial Day party. I made the full-fat version and added more orange juice to the batter to bump up the orange flavor. I also made it with a golden butter cake mix as that was all I had in the pantry. For decoration I put tons of red, white, and blue sprinkles on top. It looked really festive and the kids went crazy for it. The hostess put out all the desserts and (no lie) everyone pointed to my cake for a piece. The taste was buttery and flavorful with all the fruit in it. The pudding made the whipped topping silky and delicious. This recipe is a keeper! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#1#My mother in law introduce the original version of this cake to me in 1974. And I have loved it every since I tasted it. I am only going to rate the original because I haven't tried the non reduce version yet. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#1#1#I made this cake for the first time this week and its so delicious and refreshing. The topping is almost like a creamy fruit salad. I, too, made a non-reduced version. I'd rather have a small piece of the real deal than a bigger piece of artificial sweeteners, fat free whatever, etc. So, the changes I made upon reading the reviews were: to the cake, I added a tsp. of orange extract, used three whole eggs (as called for on the cake mix box) instead of egg whites and used canola oil instead of applesauce.To the topping, I used regular instant pudding and regular frozen whipped topping. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#2#1#My family loved this dessert! I have now made it several times by special request. My only advice, to be sure to FOLD the whipped topping. The first time I didn't pay close attention and used a mix master. Came out runny but still tasted great. Thanks for sharing this new favorite for our family! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This is one of my families favorite cakes! Moist, delicious, and refreshing.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#My husband loves it, me too
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Need more orange (use larger can) .... Idea add banana on cake before the topping
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#For the reviewers interested in using Orange Cake mix--I purchased some on Mar. 26 for this recipe (but I have not made it yet). It was Orange Supreme by DH's. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I have this recipe in a 1982 church cookbook I purchased in Kentucky. The recipe calls this cake Pig-Licking Cake, another recipe in same book calls it Pig Pickin Cake but it adds orange juice in the mix. Whatever you call it, it is a very good cake.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I made this cake for our church bingo and it was gone in a flash. We were surprised that people offered to pay two dollars for a second slice because it was so good.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I have made this cake many times it is a favorite in our family. But I changed it to use banana pudding mix(sugar-free) and use a small can of crushed pineapple which is sufficient. Also use 1/2 cup canola oil instead of applesauce. My great grandson's special cake, it tastes like a banana flip. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#1#0#Have been making this non-reduced cake for almost 40 years. I do. however, add orange and pineapple extracts to intensify the flavor. Especially good on a hot summer day right out of the fridge.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Easy to make and very easy to eat! ??
Pineapple Orange Cake#1#0#This is now my favorite cake! It turned out flavorful and moist, and, best of all the calorie-count is reasonable for a dessert. I added 2 teaspoons of Orange Extract to bump-up the orange flavor. Bettyann in San Antonio, Texas
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I also made this as a poke cake with orange sugar-free gelatin. It is incredibly moist and adds more orange flavor. Sometimes I sprinkle it with toasted coconut. Love it!
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#very moist super easy to make definate make again
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#1#I made this cake and it was good. Moist and lemon-y! But I used lemon pudding, instead of v as nilla. I gave 8 people a piece and they all wanted the recipe!
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#1#This has been a family favorite for years. Have no idea why people have had tasteless, dry results. Never had that happen. Have been asked for recipes whenever I have served it at parties or brought to gatherings. Always make sure I have copies available. Wonderful summertime dessert! We are a family of diabetics so this treat is special
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I can't wait to try this although I won't use sugar free because my daughter in law doesn't like the children to eat anything with artificial sweetener . Oh by the way it's Pig Lickin not Pig Pickin 
Pineapple Orange Cake#1#0#I was very disappointed with this recipe. I agree with Tilda 04, it was dry and had no flavor. I was expecting an orangey tasting cake and could taste no orange. I made this for my grandson, age 13, and he did not care for it at all. He loves everything I make for him and is so easy to please, but this did not please. Had to throw it away.
Pineapple Orange Cake#1#1#I don't know what all the ravening is about. This cake was not good at all. Made it yesterday, I didn't think it was moist. In fact it was a little dry and didn't have a taste. I will not make it again. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Wonderful cake!! The Grandkids love helping make this cake. We enjoyed this very much. Thank you for sharing.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Nice, light, refreshing cake. My husband does not have a sweet tooth, so he appreciated this cake the most. He can't stand super sweet buttercream type frostings. The mixture of pudding, pineapple and whipped topping was perfect. The cake was much more spongey than most cakes which made it come out of the pan without any problems at all. I think I over-mixed it because there were very few discernible bits of mandarin orange in it. Next time I'll mix it less for sure. Thanks for this lovely alternative to the heavier, sweeter, quick desserts. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#1#0#I don't get what all the fuss is about. I made this for my family of 4 plus my mother-in-law who was visiting. None of us thought it was anything special. It was okay, but I can't see that I'll be making it again. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#1#On my gosh, is this wonderful!!! Refreshing and so tasty! My Group loved this, ate it up within 5 minutes. This is a definite keeper.....in answer to Marykauhi, I just used the small package of Jello Instant Pudding.......I think that 1 oz pkg is a typo. Try this!!!!!! I'm not a fruit type dessert fan, but wow, is this yummy!!!! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I originally got all mixed up and put the pineapple in the cake and the mandarin orange in the topping which I made with 8 oz cream cheese instead of the whip topping! Yesterday I made this again and was careful to follow directions exactly. I very much preferred my mixed up version and will be making it that way from now on.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This has been a hit with everyone who has tried it from family, friends and coworkers. Many have asked me for the recipe.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Light and delicious and a hit with everyone who's tasted it. I prefer to make the topping with regular instant pudding instead of sugar-free, so there's no hint of an aspartame aftertaste... 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I made this the other day and it was fantastic! A keeper for sure!
Pineapple Orange Cake#1#0#very delicious, cool n refreshing for the summer. I did add a tablespoon of grated orange rind to the cake bake batter though
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I made this exactly according to the recipe and took it to a funeral dinner. It was loved by all! Had several requests for the recipe. Light and moist, definitely a keeper!
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Good one
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I made exactly as directed! Easy and a good recipe. My family of 4 enjoyed and my husband just took the leftovers to his card night so hopefully the guys will like it also. :-)
Pineapple Orange Cake#1#0#This is one of my husband's new favorites! I made it the less-healthy way and followed the yellow cake directions with added mandarin oranges. I also added coconut to the coolwhip/crushed pineapple frosting. Out of this world good!!!! Next time I plan to use the mandarin orange juice in place of the water in the cake mix and also add chopped mandarin oranges to the frosting. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#my whole family loves this cake, I make it for every occassion, diebeties run in my family, this is good but I use a sugar free white cake mix, best I have ever tasted. It is a family favorite for all time.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I took this to work and it was a bit hit!
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Love this cake!
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This is one of my favorite cakes! It is flavorful, moist, and guilt-free! But I've also made it using all the normal type ingredients (regular instant vanilla pudding, regular cool whip, etc) with phenominal results! So good! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Very light and tasty. Will make again soon.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Made this cake for a church social and everyone loved it. Did use the suggestions in the book and used the cheesecake pudding mix and th orange flavoring in the icing. I also, used a Duncan Hines orange cake mix and added fat free cream cheese to the icing. Turned out great.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Easy to make and a very good desert!
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Simple and good. (However, I didn't do the lo-cal, lo-fat, no-yolk method. w/o guilt.) Next time I will use mandarin oranges instead of pineapple in the topping as well as in the cake. The pineapple overpowers the orange flavor, which I love, to almost non-existent. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I made this cake for the July 4th festivities at my aunt's house and everyone loved it! I even made the american flag with blueberries and strawberries on top. It's so easy to make and its so light, so you won't feel bad about indulging a little! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Made this cake as part of my Mother's Day menu and it was a hit!! It was so moist and light......everyone loved it!! I will be making this one again!!! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I made this for Easter and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved how moist and flavorful it was. I will definitely make this again!
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This was fantastic! A HUGE hit with all 5 of my boys and my husband - not an easy task! Will definitely make this again and again!!
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This is delicious! Next time I might add some coconut to the topping.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I've made this one so many times. It is such a great light summer dessert. I always get requests for the recipe. The fact that it is almost guilt free is a bonus because it tastes so good! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I made this recipe as part of our Mother's Day menu and it was a total hit! My father is diabetic, so after reading another review I purchased the reduced sugar yellow cake mix by Pillsbury. I also used a can of light mandarin oranges, used the egg whites from a carton in the egg section rather than cracking eggs and used sugar free Cool Whip. It was delicious and my dad's sugar didn't shoot through the roof - perfect! The cake tastes MUCH better after being in the fridge for at least 12 hours, and got even better after that. Wonderful light dessert! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#me and my mom made it but it did not tast done so we put it in up to an 1hr but it steel was not done):
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#how long do u leave it
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#One of the best if not the best ever. I have made it several times and always a hit. Shared the recipe with lots of friends
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#You can make this cake up to two days ahead, and it actually tastes better than when made and eaten on the same day. It tastes very rich but isn't. Nice cake for springtime. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This cake is fabulous!! And so easy to make. It's a new family favorite! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This should be 5 stars, but the website won't let me give it 5 stars! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#One of the best desserts on the planet!
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I, like other people, prefer not to use sugar-free ingredients. So I use regular pudding mix and regular cool whip. :) Tastes great! :) Also: WRONG Cklee. I'm not sure why you felt the need to correct people? A simple google search would have told you it is PIG PICKIN' - NOT pig lickin'. I have no idea why you'd try to correct people without first making sure YOU were correct. (You're not.) 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#We like plenty of topping, so I used about 12 oz of the whipped topping and about 1 1/2 pks of the pudding mix, added a half cup of coconut, spread it over the cake, popped it in the fridge overnight and it was a wonderful, light, cool dessert, perfect for the hot Texas heat! I will definitely make it again!
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#So good and easy to make. It is delicious and takes the guilt away from eating something sweet.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Fantastic recipe!! I further reduced the sugar by using the new Pillsbury reduced sugar cake mix.Marilyn
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This Pineapple Orange cake is the best low calorie, low sugar, dessert I have ever made! It is easy to fix and I get rave reviews when I serve to friends. I LOVE this recipe.Jean
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I have made this for guests and they loved it. It is cool and sweet but most of the ingredients are sugar free. My family loves jello cake and thought this was a wonderful addition to our recipe box!! Thank you, Cindy
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Sounds so refreshing -- can't wait to try it! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This cake was good, not too sweet, just sweet enough! Would make it again.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I used the Jello brand Cheesecake pudding instead of Vanilla-DELICIOUS! I may add a little orange extract next time. And one small note, my texture tongued daughter did not like the crushed pineapple things in her frosting. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This cake is great. It is so pretty.And so easy...I put crushed pecans around top, next time I may try a small mount of oranges or cherries on top.I took it to church dinner.Everyone wanted to know what was in it.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I tried this one for Easter dinner. My family really enjoyed it, even my sister (who is a PIE PERSON) said this is delicious. Thanks
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Light and delicious; simple to make. The 20 oz is a lot of pineapple, but is great if you're a pineapple fan. I think I'll try putting a little coconut in the frosting next time - even though it adds to the sugar and fat content - just seems like it would be good. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I baked this cake for Easter & my sis usually does all the baking but I took a shot at baking and the entire family LOVED IT! Everyone was surprised that it was low fat!
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I made this cake and took it to the women's Joy Fellowship meeting at church Tuesday evening. It was easy to make, looked fabulous and tasted scrumptious! I had a lot of good comments about it and several requests for the recipe.

Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I made the cake to take to a church class meeting. The ladies there called it a pig picking cake. Most of it was eaten, leaving me very little to bring home for my husband.

Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Wow, we really liked this dessert. I used Duncan Hines orange cake instead of yellow. The taste of the cake and topping were great. Wonderful appearance. Easy to make. Will keep in my favorites.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I made this cake last sunday when I had friends over fo a wrestling show and they loved it some asked for seconds it was very good
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#My family and me thought this to be a excellent and yummy cake. Would not change a thing.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#My cake totally flopped. I made sure all the ingredients were correct. The cake was only about 1/2 high. The worst part was I took it to a potluck. The only thing I can think of was I sprayed the dish with Pam like the receipe said & maybe it got on the sides. Never used spray before to grease a cake dish. Any thoughts on what happened would be appreciated. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Tasty! My family really liked the texture of the cake, and will definitely make it again. I was surprised that it didn't have much of an orange flavor, but loved the topping. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Have made this by the original recipe and think this updated lower fat version is much better. The topping could served in small dishes sprinkled with nuts or some other topping for a great light dessert.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This cake is very good, quick and easy to make.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Made this cake for my birthday to take to work. Everyone thought it was great! It is a great light cake..dont feel so bad when you eat this one. Great recipe.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#My family loved it. It was refreshing at the end of the meal.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Tastes great and very easy to make using ingredients I had on hand. Very moist after refrigerating.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This is great !! I made it for our coffee group at church and the Friars want one for Easter.So, I'm making two . Thanks. Betty Dyer 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#The Pineapple Orange cake got rave revues from dinner company. Not too sweet and great frosting. Will keep this recipe in my favorites book.Arizona Snow Bird 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This was very good. Light and not too rich. Will make again.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I made this for my work (the guys are self-conscious and want to keep their girlish figures) and everyone raved about it. My hubbie, who isn't a big sweet eater, said he could eat more than 2 pieces!! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This is just delicious, my Husband has not stopped raving about it. He does not like overly sweet deserts and this is just right level of sweetness. I will be passing this recipe on to my friends.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I made this cake for friends and all wanted copies of the recipe. I found it easy to make and delicious. Very moist. Definitely one I'll make again 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This recipe was really delicious. My family loved it!! I wouldn't change a thing about it. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This is a very simple recipe, and so refreshing! Will definitely make again, especially this summer! I shared the cake with my co-workers, got very positive comments.Sandra sanborn
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This is yummy. Very easy to make. Refreshing change from chocolate cake. Will definitely make it again.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This was so simple to make, very moist and tasty, and much more volume than a regular cake. Good pot luck dessert.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This is a delicious recipe;and I have made it many times;very light; one of my husbands favorite.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I don't know what I did wrong, but it turned out very heavy more like apound cake, it was moist, taste was Ok, but not what I expected, I wanted it more like cake, like the picture. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This is a refreshing dessert and it is light. I think personally the topping has too much pineapple, but I'm not a strong pineapple lover. I like the coconut idea, just adds more calories. Easy to make - looks good and tastes good 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I made this for a small group of my friends and everyone really loved it. It is very light and delicious.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I made this for a fun party... EVRYONE LOVED IT.. they wanted the recipe.. I am going to make for Easter and add a little coconut on top and some PEEPS!!!
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This cake was delicious, but I still lightened it with Egg Beaters egg whites and Fat free Cool Whip.The cake itself was a tad on the heavy side, but still very tasty.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Yes, thank you for all your recipes, the orange cake went it in a hurry, delicious , will make againJacqueline Spencer
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I made this cake to take to a dinner & I did not think the cake part was very moist ,, I liked the frosting,,, I bake & decorate cakes & this one just did not seem moist it was sort of dry I thought ..
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I made this cake for a party I was having. I was very happy with how easy it was to prepare as I didn't have alot of extra time. My guests and family really liked it.When I told them how easy it was to make they all wanted the recipe! I will definetly make this cake again! jeds 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I have a local Hawaiian recipe very similar. The icing is a bit different, calls for 8 oz. cream cheese (use light or fat-free), 1 cup cold non-fat milk and 1 box vanilla instant pudding. (I haven't tried it with sugar-free pudding). It also called for a 20-oz can of crushed pineapple, drained. The pineapple juice was used as liquid in the cake mix. For icing, beat cream cheese and pudding together, slowly beat in milk to desired consistency. Fold in drained pineapple. Fold in 1 carton fat free Cool Whip. Spread on top of cake. Sprinkle with chopped macadamia nuts if desired. Refrigerate. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#AMAZINGLY moist cake! Family didn't care for the icing though--mostly a texture thing, but also thought it made it too sweet. Used plain whipped topping instead. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#i fixed the cake for the first time turned out great !!! i think you can drain the pineapple juice ,,and would be fine
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#The sugar free instant pudding is 1.5 oz. That should work just fine.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#The package they are referring to is the 4-serving instant sugar-free pudding. Without sugar it weighs almost nothing. I have also used lemon or butterscotch sugar-free instant pudding for something different. Two very ripe bananas are also good instead of the oranges. It's one of my favorites also. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#does anyone know how much pudding to use? recipe says 1 oz but you can't buy 1 oz pkgs. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#will a 102g vanilla instant pudding mix be the right amount to use in this recipe
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Pineapple Orange Cake,Is the 1 oz. pudding mix correct size?SB
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#BANANA WILL WORK IN PLACE OF APPLESAUCE
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#A though to try other than apples; pumpkin. I have used this in recipe to bring down the fat and add nutrients that are good for you. After reading this recipe I think it would be good with pumpkin.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I'm allergic to apples. Does anyone know of another ingredient I could use instead of applesauce. I have this difficulty with all recipes that are low in fat and use applesauce to provide the necessary moisture. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#THAT SOUNDS GREAT AND NICE AND REFESHING AND WILL BE GOOD FOR MY HUSBAND. ALMOST LIKE MY OTHER ANGEL FOOD CAKE. GRACE
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Sounds yummy and can not wait to try.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I make this cake regularly without using the light stuff. I add a lg. can of mandarin oranges to the cake before baking. I also add a whole can of drained oranges to the top of the cake after it's topped with the cool whip/pineapple mix.DELISH! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#GREAT comment mlowry!  This should answer the question about the pudding mix in this cake for those who want to try it.  I'm making this cake this weekend & I can't wait to taste it.  
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#One variation of this is to mix one small box of orange jello according to the box directions. Let the jello cool and pour over baked cake that you poked holes in (you can use a fork to do this). Frosting the cake and chill in the frig overnight. It's tasty and pretty when you cut it! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#yes you do !!!!!
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Re: Pineapple Orange CakeI just made this cake for the first time. It was so easy! It tastes absolutely wonderful! Does not tast like a light cake at all, which makes it even better. Thanks for the recipe.Nikki Chorniak
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Doesn't using a cake mix add partially hydrogenated oil to the ingredients; therefore, making it not heart healthy..... 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#the pudding mix will act as a thickener for the undrained pineapple.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I am confused, is the recipe wrong then? The pineapple needs to be drained? JS
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#The recipe says 1 can (11 ounces) crushed pineapple, UNDRAINED.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Do you drain the pineapple or not? It seems that the pudding would need some liquid. JF
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I make this cake and the pineapple needs to be drained.SMC
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#thank you for comment about adding the pudding mix dry, I agree and will make it for Easter
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#the pudding is dry and the pineapple with juice is added instead of mixing the pudding as directed on the box. i have used this topping recipe with the cool whip to make a dream pie. it is very good. but it depends on what flavor pudding you use.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I make a similar topping for a dessert, and the pudding IS NOT prepared first. The juice and pineapple provide the liquid, and when the whipped topping is added it makes a creamy topping with enough stability to spread. If you prepare the pudding according top package directions, it will be much too runny.It doesn't include prepare according to directions because that is not what is to be done. It states pudding mix instead, so it should be added dry. Try it! It is a great easy top layer for the cake! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that the liquid in the topping ingredients of undrained crushed pineapple and the whipped topping is enough to achieve the desired results for the topping of this cake. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#andrrea, I believe the pudding mix is added dry to the topping. Normally instructions would state that you must prepare the pudding according to package directions if that is what is required.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#please post above comment about the pudding mix. Is it added without milk or made up first and then added to whipping. I am going to make it for Easter
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This cake is fantastic and does get better each day . I have used egg beaters instead of whites & have used a yoplait orange or pineapple yogurt in place of applesauce. A great cake. Naples, Fl.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#I've baked this cake a lot of times, but I am going to bake it for Easter using this lite version. It is good with coconut added in the topping also. 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#this is my favorie cake as well. always turns out moist and delecious. and so easy. People think you really fussed, and you didn't! 
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This is a fantastic recipe. It just gets better and better until the pan is empty. The pineapple really penetrates the flavor of the cake. It is so much better the second day.
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#Sounds delicious but do you add the pudding mix dry to the pineapple?
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This is such an awesome recipe. I have made is so many times. No one can believe it is low fat, it tastes so good. On top of it all, it is easy, that is very important these days. Thanks for sharing it with us all
Pineapple Orange Cake#0#0#This is one of my favorite recipes. I prefer to use white cake, though.
Baked Spaghetti#2#0#I make this recipe a lot. I do add extra parmesan and another can of mushroom soup on top. Could not imagine leaving out the black olives. That would make the recipe bland.
Baked Spaghetti#2#2#We thought this recipe was rather bland. The sauce was overpowered by the pasta. If I make it again I would add more cheese, tomato/spaghetti sauce and less pasta.
Baked Spaghetti#6#3#I usually try to make a recipe once the correct way and then make changes on the second time. But for our maiden voyage tonight, my whole family liked this a lot and they didn't think we needed to do anything differently in the future. As someone else wrote, it seems a nice way to serve spaghetti to switch things up a bit. Very nice! 
Baked Spaghetti#3#2#Very good. Could use a little more spice.
Baked Spaghetti#7#1#A nice change from the usual spaghetti dinner. I had fresh mushrooms that needed to be used so I chopped them up and put them in the onion and pepper saute. My family really likes cheese so I doubled the amount of Parmesan on the top. This will definitely go into the recipe rotation!
Baked Spaghetti#1#3#I will definitely make this. I like every single ingredient in this, so I fail to see why I wouldn't like it. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Tasty, hearty, filling...different enough to not seem like any other pasta dish. Don't have veggie vans, then cut things small and they really won't notice. Like the idea to next time add pepperoni. Probably will double the parmesan on top. 
Baked Spaghetti#7#0#I found this recipe when I ordered my first Taste of home recipe file. It is easy , filling and we love the taste. This has been a family favorite for years. It is just now just my husband and I now and I have found to with freeze well in foil baking dishes.
Baked Spaghetti#6#0#I first made this spaghetti recipe when it came out in my first Taste of Home magazine. It became a favorite, and years later, it remains so. The taste is fresh and not overpowered by spaghetti sauce. It's a keeper! 
Baked Spaghetti#4#0#I have made this dish for years. I don't like olives so I leave them out. I love this dish because it doesn't taste like spaghetti. It's just plain good
Baked Spaghetti#0#2#Was just ok. Won't make again.
Baked Spaghetti#1#0#This is yummy! 
Baked Spaghetti#3#0#This recipe brings such nostalgic memories. When my father came to visit over 20 yrs ago, we found this recipe and made it together. He loved it and it became one of my favorite recipes. My father has since passed away and I cant help but hold that memory dear when we cooked together. I have six children and it always provided a much loved dinner. I saved that old torn out recipe from the magazine so I never lost it. So happy to see it is still being printed. Never stop sharing this recipe!
Baked Spaghetti#5#1#This recipe is a family favorite (since it appeared in the Taste of Home magazine back in the 90s) and my go to casserole for potluck dinners. Many request the recipe. Easy to prepare as you probably have all the ingredients on hand. Thanks Ruth Koberna for this delicious recipe!
Baked Spaghetti#2#0#This recipe has been a family favorite ever since it first appeared in Taste of Home in 1994! Now that it's just the two of us, I bake it in two 8x8-inch pans and freeze one to enjoy at a later date or share with a friend. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#3#I cut this recipe in half but used the full can of soup, diluted with 1/4 cup water per the instructions. Using that amount of water, the soup is too thick to pour , and it really doesn't cover the top of only half the recipe. The olives and oregano give it some flavor, but this casserole needs the optional beef or even sausage to make it delicious. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#This is a nice change from traditional spaghetti. I left out the olives since my family doesn't like them. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Question--could I use my own sauce/ vegetable mixture and use it instead of the sauce in the recipe? And what does the mushroom soup add to the recipe? moisture? Thanks for any help! 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Very good. I l doubled the amount of oregano and left out the olives. Nice to be able to make it ahead of time earlier in the day and baking later on for dinner.
Baked Spaghetti#2#0#This recipe was really good. I, however, put my on twist and substituted Italian sausage for ground beef. Made it taste even better!!!
Baked Spaghetti#2#1#The reviews were so good I couldn't Wait to make this recipe. It was so bland I threw it out. I just don't understand all the great reviews. I followed the recipe.except used fresh mushrooms cooked and left out the olives. It had no taste. Oh well. 
Baked Spaghetti#1#0#This great recipe is a go to whenever we have company. I make it in the morning and put in the fridge until I'm ready to pop it in the oven. I can spend more time with my guests and less time fussing in the kitch. Its always a hit and often requested by return guests. 
Baked Spaghetti#1#0#I have been making this recipe for many many years. I take it to potlucks, reunions, funerals, Christmas parties - you name it! It always gets rave reviews. I just made this for a church function but added pepperoni to it and everyone loved it.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Made this for a work function and it was an odd recipe, but it was quite delicious. It was a hearty meal to feed a bunch of hungry guys. At first we were nervous when it was spaghetti with cream of mushroom soup, but the combo actually made a delicious topping.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Just made this dish, very tasty ?? I would not change a thing.
Baked Spaghetti#2#0#Great recipe. I used 2 cans of 14 oz. Rotel tomatoes instead of the 28 oz can of diced tomatoes.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#This is the best baked spaghetti! It's great for the family and also perfect for making for others because everyone loves it. Something about it tastes better every time. We like it as the recipe is, but it's also good to mix sausage with the ground beef for a nice twist. Thanks so much for this favorite recipe! 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#This is THE ultimate comfort food. Anything baked spaghetti is always good!!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#gad I love everything about the looks and sound of this, can't wait for a free night 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Loved it, but used sausage instead of gr. meat.
Baked Spaghetti#0#1#My husband liked this recipe but I didn't care that much for it. But I used canned spaghetti sauce and a can of mushrooms so maybe had I made it according to the recipe it would have been better. Don't know though as I doubt I'll try it again. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Love This!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#My neighbor made this for me when I was in the hospital; of course, I had to get the recipe.. I love it!! Next time I make it, I'm going to try Italian sausage instead of ground beef. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#My entire family Loves this recipe. It is great for multiple meals
Baked Spaghetti#1#0#This recipe is very good with just a few additions, add salt & pepper to taste to the ground beef. Then add garlic to taste. Add 3/4 cup of water to the mushroom soup that you pour over the top layer. And then, cover the top layer with shredded mozzarella cheese along with the Parmesan. I also added fresh cooked mushrooms to the meat/diced tomato mix. Now you go from good to great! This version is tastier and more moist than original.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Loved it! Used red peppers since I had no green ones and also left out black olives. Would be great for a pot luck or just feeding a group of friends. Keeper!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Delicious meal! Good to make ahead for taking meals to people!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Cooked exactly as in recipe and it was delish. A really different take on traditional spaghetti, creamy and smooth taste.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I really liked this recipe. It was a nice change from tomato base. I liked the mushroom soup in it.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#We found this to be bland and rather dry, especially with next day leftovers. It's a time consuming recipe, but it's just okay tasting and not worth the effort as is. I added 5 garlic cloves and some salt and pepper to the hamburger while cooking it, but that extra seasoning didn't go far enough to make this have real flavor. If you like plain food, then you'd like this. But if I were to make it again, I would use spaghetti sauce rather than diced tomatoes for sure. The casserole doesn't really have any sauce to it, and the shredded cheese disappears when you bake the casserole, leaving you with 2 layers of dry spaghetti noodles with some bits of diced tomato. There are other spaghetti casserole recipes I would try here before this one. It's really not that good. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Like it very much, thank you
Baked Spaghetti#1#0#Good flavor, easy prep. Will make again.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Really enjoyed this casserole. My only change was adding minced garlic to the vegetable mixture and using Golden Mushroom Soup. Thank you Ruth and Taste of Home for a family favorite.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#This was a big hit with my family. Since we don't like mushrooms, I substituted cream of celery soup for the cream of mushroom soup and added pepperoni. It was absolutely delightful! 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#This is virtually identical to the chicken spaghetti recipe I've been making for the past 40 years. Chicken instead of ground beef and green stuffed olives instead of black olives. It's very good either way. It's been a staple at big family dinners for decades. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#One of my family's favorite recipes. I like to use Spicy sausage in place of the ground beef, it adds lots of flavor. Our guests always want the recipe. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#1#I made for a Church function today and used crushed tomatoes and added another can of mushroom and a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic; but pretty much kept the rest the same. Oh, substituted wine for the water and next time will definitely add wine to the sauce. The bottom layer was too dry so will add sauce to the pasta before putting that layer down; and before adding the burger to the sauce! Probably will make more sauce -- but all in all pretty well received....Then again could probably be very good without layering and just mixing it all together -- definitely would cut prep time!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I fixed this last night for supper and it was absolutely DELICIOUS !!!!! I would have never thought that cream of mushroom soup on top of baked spaghetti would be good. It was a big hit at my house. :)
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#YUM!! I also don't like canned soup, I make a white sauce & add LOTS of mushrooms. I eliminate the green peppers and olives, just my preference. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#This was delish!! LaHolm, you can use a simple white sauce (flour, milk, butter) instead of the canned soup.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Fabulous , easy recipe and I gave it 5 stars because I copied & printed about ten of the reviews with variations on the theme. Incredibly useful for the basic recipe and variations to suit my mood or the spices and meats I have on hand.
Baked Spaghetti#0#1#This is my #1 favorite recipe that I ever found in ToH magazine. I made it all the time when my kids were growing up. However, the original recipe called for whole, not diced tomatoes. I don't know why they changed it - I've made it both ways and prefer it the way the recipe was originally written. I add a little granulated garlic, and I also use fresh mushrooms and saute them over med-high heat until they get a little color. Ground turkey works great, too. Love love love this recipe. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#This is my go to recipe for company. I've been making it for years. I do use Penzys Turkish oregano which I think makes the dish so tasty. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I would prefer something other than canned soups. Your suggestions?
Baked Spaghetti#0#1#I will try this recipe but definitely need to add garlic!! Also I would use mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese. Love cheddar cheese but pasta needs garlic and mozzarella.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Wonderful full meal with garlic bread and salad! Sue
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#This has been our family's favorite spaghetti dish since it first appeared in ToH in'94 (can't believe it's been 20 years)! I misplaced the original paper recipe, so I checked it out here - thank goodness it was listed or I would be in BIG trouble with the family! It's easy to prep ahead of time and keep in the fridge till you're ready to pop it in the oven, avoiding the last minute dinner rush. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#1#Great dinner for the family!!!!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I made this for my family tonight and this was delicious..Thank you for the receipe
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I will try this particular recipe, but I have made one very similar and only takes 20 min on top of stove. After step 1 I add one can of beef broth with the diced tomatoes (I have used stewed also but I use my one hand blender to break up the tomatoes so they are not so chunky), no need to add water, when it comes to a boil I add uncooked bow tie pasta right into the pan (about 1 1/2 C. or so and cook for 10 min until pasta is done, then add 1/4 C grated cheese. No need to bake. I don't use cream soup or olives but every one I have made this for loves it. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I have been making baked spaghetti for years. Umm good!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#longstanding family favorite - lost the recipe and am glad to have found it again!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I love this recipe but I put spaghetti sauce in mine. We like it much better with the sauce.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Love this!!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Yummy
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Love this recipe. My mother has been making this baked spaghetti for over 20 years and now I am making it for the holiday get together.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Can't believe i haven't reviewed this before. Been making it for years. Every one enjoys it. The only change i make (i never buy canned mushrooms), i used fresh mushrooms, sliced, then nuked in micro for a bit. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I cannot tell you how many times I've made this and it is fantastic each time! I do add italian sausage to the hamburger to kick up the flavor a bit. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#This is a good recipe. The only things I did different was to omit the mushrooms and olives and instead of oregano I used Italian seasoning. I also used roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup per another reviewer. And for the tomatos I used Hunts Diced Tomatoes with Basil, Garlic & Oregano. Good flavor, will make agan.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Wasn't sure my husband would like it due to the mushrooms, but he loved it. Great flavors. Black Olives really livened it up. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I've made this recipe so many times I've lost count. My family loves it..it's great for family get togethers or when friends come over. The only changes I made were adding the hamburger, leaving out the olives and adding more cheese. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I've made this recipe so many times I've lost count. My family loves it..it's great for family get togethers. The only changes were I added the hamburger, left out the olives and added extra cheese. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#My family loved this dish. I only had 1 small can of tomatoes so I added about 1/2 cup of spaghetti sauce and left out the black olives. I would make it the same way next time. I really liked the mushroom soup on top.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Absolutely amazing! My family and especially my in-laws scarfed this down. Mind you, my in-laws are 86 and 90 years old. I've made a Mexican variation of this recipe. I sub'd diced green chiles for olives and mushrooms, cream of chicken for cream of mushroom, taco seasoning for oregano, and mozzarella for parmesan cheese. I cooked the pasta al dente in water with 4 tbsp low sodium chicken boullion, 2 tbsp onion powder, a pinch of kosher salt (never table salt for cooking), and 1 tbsp olive oil. I used 1/2 can of the noodle broth to dilute the cream of chicken soup. (The hot water helped blend the soup quickly and evenly...plus the water was already flavored.) This is a DEFINITE make again hot dish! Bon Appetite! 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I liked this because I felt it was a little different than the typical baked spaghetti casserole. My boyfriend said he would have liked it better with more tomatoes. I personally like the cream of mushroom sauce on the top and wouldn't change it if it were for just me. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I have been making this many years. Iest is my favorite baked spaghetti and my family loves it also with no changes. As good reheated.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I made this recipe because of all of the great reviews. I'm not sure if I would make it again because I felt it was just ok 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Used this recipe for the first time for a Christmas Party this year. I knew there was going to be a crowd so I doubled the recipe.(it made a HUGE amount) The Baked spaghetti was the hit of the party!!!!!! We didn't bring one bit home! Did increase the amount of cheese. I mixed the cheese into the spaghetti before putting it in the baking dish. Really spread the cheesy around nicely. Love, Love Love this recipe!!!! The family has been begging me to make it again already. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Love this dish! Always make 2 pans, 1 with pasta and the other with spaghetti squash (cut open remove seeds ect then rub with cut garlic and olive oil,bake about 45 min.when cooled scrape out noodles ) we all actually like the squash better plus it's diabetic and figure friendly. I mix soup in with sauce cause it's easier and tastes fine. Try this you'll love it. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I cook for bingo, and I have made this several times. Everyone loves it, and it's easy to make. I have also made it several times for my family. They also think it's super delicious. I do add salt and pepper. I triple the recipe and make homemade bread. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I have been using this recipe for a long time! It is so good :) if you're in a hurry you can skip the onion & green pepper & burger, as well as use spaghetti sauce. Although it tastes best following the recipe as stated. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef. It was really good. Makes a lot!!!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Have been making this TOH recipe to rave reviews for years, it is my go to recipe when I make Baked Spaghetti. Making it tomorrow for my husband to share with his co-workers!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I have been making this for years. It is the best! Everyone loves it.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I added some Italian Seasoning, garlic powder, salt & Pepper for a bit more flavor. I cooked my beef and vegetables in olive oil, for all I believe that all Italian dishes must have olive oil. Also added it to the spaghetti water. It needed about 1 1/2 cans mushroom soup and another 1/8 cup water. I felt that it was a little dry so I willtry adding more tomatoes to it next time. Took this to a church dinner and still got lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Not bad, it came out a little plain and had no taste (I followed the recipe without any changes). I would add more salt and seasonings before baking this dish. I added seasonings and hot sauce to this after I noticed it had no taste and it eas then edible and I didn't mind it but my husband barely touched his plate so I wouldn't make this again. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I must say this was absolutely delicious. I made mine with whole wheat spaghetti, ground turkey and followed the rest of the recipe to a tee. I will be making this again, thanks for sharing!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#unexpectedly good! I was a bit skeptical (mushroom soup?!) but I trusted what the reviewers said gave it a try. Really good! My father-in-law and husband both had three helpings! I did change a couple things: yellow pepper instead of green, and fresh mushroom instead of canned, since this is what I had. I also left out the meat to keep it vegetarian. I also assembled everything the night before and then popped it into the oven for dinner, which made things that much easier on a busy mom. I will be making this again.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#My first time baking Spaghetti and absolutely in love with this meal. Hubby and kids loved it and would like me to make this again soon. I used a bigger can of mushroom and used 2 cans of cream of mushroom. LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#This is the #1 favorite of my son, so I make it often. The whole family loves it! We cannot eat bell pepper, so I omit them. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I make this recipe often, and everyone loves it, including the grandkids! I even make it for bunco, getting raves over it! The only addition I make is a very small can of tomato sauce when I add the diced tomatoes. It's so delicious and comforting. LOVE this recipe! 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#This very recipe came out in 1995 and I have used it many times since. Everyone loves it!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I have been making this for years, it is one of my families favorites. I make it often for company for something different and it always gets rave reviews. Don't let the different ingredients detour you. It is a flavor combo that is unexpected, delicious and packed full of veggies. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I have made this recipe several time. My son-in-law says this is the best. It's very good. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Very good although I made it without olives (don't care for them). Also made a side portion without meat for the vegetarian. Everyone enjoyed it. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#This is one of the most delicious dinners we have had. It freezes well too. :)
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I started making this recipe in 1994 when I first saw it in a Taste of Home magazine. I have found none to compare to this version of baked spaghetti. Everyone that tries it wants the recipe. This recipe is not a traditional tomato based type, but is rather creamy with enough oregano to give it that special ooomph! 18 years is a long time to make a recipe. It's definitely a keeper. This makes quite a bit. I fed my growing family of four way back in 1994 and had leftovers for several days. Now I make it in its full recipe, but freeze much of it so that I can have it later. I don't add the cheese to the top of the frozen ones until ready to bake. This recipes freezes beautifully. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I have made this a few times now. I have made a few adjustments, I add only 1 can of tomatoes, also I add garlic salt and Mrs Dash Spicey seasoning (2 tsps each) to the mixture when I add the oregano. I also add a little paprika to the cream if mushroom sauce before I spread the soup over the casserole. I feel this adds enough extra spice to give it alot of taste. Everyone in my home loves this dish.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#This was the first recipe I ever tried from taste of home back in 1994. It has been a family favorite. I can t begin to tell you the number of times I have made it or the number of recipes I have given out. The only thing I do differently is instead of diced tomatoes, I use crushed. My family does not like big chunks of tomatoes 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I made this recipe when it was first published (1994?) and it has been a favorite since that time. On occasion I have used rotini instead of spaghetti, especially when taking for something special.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I make this every fall for my guys to take to hunting camp. It's their opening night tradition! Filling--and feeds lots. Leftovers are great--if there are any! 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I made this recipe about two weeks ago and my husband raved about it. It makes quite a bit, so we refridged the remainder, reheated it next day at lunch and took the rest to our pastor and wife who were travelling. Everyone was delighted with it. Tonight, I am making it again for family that is coming to dinner.I did do one extra item for this meal though. I added a CAN of Hunt's spaghetti sauce with the tomatoes and about a 1/4 of a teaspoon of thyme to boot. MMMMM good stuff, this. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Family Favorite
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Love, Love, Love this recipe. One of my favorite recipies!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Fairly easy to make and rather tasty. We all went in for seconds on this one.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Very dry - too much spaghetti- not much flavor. Wouldn't make this again. I'll stick with my regular spaghetti recipe. Not work the effort. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I made this for the first time last weekend. My husband and I really enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#This recipe is a family and friend pleaser!! My husband adores this recipe and friends can't get enough! 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I've made this Taste of Home recipe for years....I do add garlic....and the mushroom soup adds a little extra something to it! Always get compliments and recipe requests! 
Baked Spaghetti#0#1#I made this Spaghetti for my family earlier this year and they loved it. My daughter isn't wild about traditional spaghetti sauce, so this recipe caught my attention because it only has the canned tomatoes in it. I have since made this for my church Wednesday Night Family Dinner feeding approx 125 people, and have had nothing but great reviews. I did add a few additional ingredients, fresh garlic, salt & pepper, red peppers in addition to the green, and I mix 1 cup 5 Blend Italian cheese with the cheddar cheese. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I thought this was pretty good....added garlic cause I think spaghetti HAS to have garlic LOL
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Tried this at home for a different twist on the normal spaghetti and my family loved it. I did add garlic powder and salt, other than that it was perfect. I also cook for my church weekly, so since it was a hit at home I made it for 125+ church members with received great reviews.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#We just didn't care for the taste with the cream of mushroom soup it was just weird. Way to much work for something thats edible but not worth making agian 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#We love this spaghetti dish! No, it's not like traditional spaghetti-with-sauce dishes, not as spicily seasoned, but in it's own right it's a delicious dish. I love the addition of the black olives in it. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#My Mom started using this recipe years ago and it remains a favorite recipe. Wonderful flavor. Easy to make. Will remain a favorite. Family loves it.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#This is a easy to make recipe and my 6 yr old daughter ate it all up...... although she wasn't to fond of the mushrooms, but that's an easy change. Will make again. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I have been making this recipe since first published. It is our favorite way for spaghetti. Have never used meat in it. Sometimes use the homrmade casserole mix for the mushroom soup and only one 14 oz can of tomatoes. Great leftovers too!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I am new to this website and WOW! I made this recipe this week and my husband absolutely loved it! Due to what I had in my pantry, I subbed spaghetti sauce and it turned out very yummy. Thank you so much for such an easy and delicious recipe.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#The review process asked if I'd make this recipe again and my answer is yes, yes and yes! My husband was never one to enjoy spaghetti with a meat sauce; but when a friend served us this recipe, he changed his mind about spaghetti. It's been years now since we first enjoyed it and it's something that everyone I've ever served raves about. I've taken it to my church Pot Luck dinners on many occasions; followed by passed out many requested copies of the recipe. Thanks Ruth Koberna and Taste of Home for this wonderful recipe.Joyce HalliseyMt. Gilead, NC 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I LOVE this recipe! I have one exactly the same cut from TOH mag probably 15 years ago. I leave off the peppers & I have made it with sweet italian sausage instead of ground beef & used crushed tomatoes instead of the diced. I use a mixture of Cheddar & Mozzarella. Awesome, serves well & freezes well even in individual containers.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I made this with keilbasa and no green peppers or mushrooms...it was wonderful!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#We loved this. I really liked the addition of the cream of mushroom soup. My dh, who hates anything that contains cream of anything soup, even loved it.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I followed the recipe with just a few changes. I used a 14 oz can of diced tomates, subsituted angel hair pasta for the spaghetti, and mixed in some paprika to the mushroom soup before pouring it over the casserole. I made this, but was not expecting much. I was surprised.... It was delicious!! My husband LOVED it. Will definately make again.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#For all the work this recipe takes; it is SO not worth it! I had to dump it all back into a big skillet and add spaghetti sauce and spices to give it flavor so I didn't have to eat the bland original. Definitely not worth it! 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#blech
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Great recipe. For a different taste try the Mushroom Soup with Roasted Garlic also delicious. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I have made this since 1994. I always have request for recipe.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#We loved it--everything on hand--easy to make
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I have been making this since 1994. It's a favorite for the whole family and others who have it here for dinner ask for the recipe. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Tried and true for years. AA++
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Excellent recipe! Serves a large number of people and freezes well. My family loves it.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#My husband and I really enjoyed this baked spaghetti. My only change I made was to leave out the olives because we aren't fans of them. Next time, to appeal more to the kids I will likely used crushed tomatoes instead of diced because they turned their noses up at the tomato chunks , and be sure to dice up the peppers smaller than I did. 
Baked Spaghetti#1#0#This is a taste of home classic that goes way back. I've made it meatless for the vegetarians in my life, but I personally like it better with the meat. I always use chopped olives, not the sliced. It makes fabulous leftovers...which is good because I will eat it every day until it's gone! I like to bring this casserole in a disposable foil container when I need a meal to give to a family. If you enjoy casseroles, this is the jackpot. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Made this recipe many,many times.Never added meat. always made meatless. Husband's all time favorite.great Lenten recipe. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Everyone loves this recipe. I make a dish of it for my family and a dish for a friend. It's a great hearty twist on spaghetti. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#family favorite for YEARS!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Tried this for the 1st time and will have to make it again to keep everybody happy. Everyone really enjoyed it.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#This is soooooooo good
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#My family didn't care much for this recipe. 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Delicious recipe! Was given to me by a lady I work with, and she got it from Taste Of Home!
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#This is one of only a few recipes that I repeat constantly. My husband loves it and will take leftovers to his buddies for lunch.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I have been making this since the first issues of Taste of Home. Its a great recipe.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I made this for the first time when I had company over and everyone loved it! This is a great recipe! Thanks for sharing.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I also have been making this recipe since 1994. My daughter now grown makes this for her family.Her kids now ask her to make it.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#Have been making this since it was in the magazine in 94. Its a great recipe.
Baked Spaghetti#0#1#LOVE THIS!!! I have 5 kids so I am always looking for recipe's that freeze well. Both my husband and I could not tell AT ALL that this had been frozen! It tasted as though I had just made it! Very yummy and although I have only made it for company twice both have asked for the recipe. Kids like it too :) 
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#I got this recipe out of the Taste of Home Magazine probably more than 15 years ago and it is still a favorite of mine and my family. I always get requests for the recipe. I make it all the time for new mothers and when I take food for the families when someone passes away because it is easy and everyone loves it. I keep the olives out and the kids love it too.
Baked Spaghetti#0#0#We've love this recipe for years, too! I've made it so many times, mainly to make 2 square pans so I can put one in the freezer. 
Buttery Cornbread#1#0#I've tried so many corn bread recipes out there and this one is the best one by far! I'm so happy I found this recipe! If you have a few extra minutes, this recipe is worth making
Buttery Cornbread#6#2#Have now made this cornbread recipe at least 20 times over the past couple years. It is an absolute hands-down' favorite of my family and some (lucky friends), when I serve it with any kind of soup, especially my kielbasa and kale soup. Deelish!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I loved the sweetness of this cornbread, and it was great fresh right out of the oven. We ate ours with butter and syrup, just like when I was a kid!
Buttery Cornbread#2#2#I just made this and had a small piece of it and it is very good. It came out a little bit dry,but that could be my fault,as I have never made any kind of corn bread,and had it in the oven a little longer,because my toothpick came out wet. Will I make this again? Absolutely! I also creamed the butter /sugar for exactly 7 minutes, until it was a nice pale yellow color.
Buttery Cornbread#6#0#Best corn bread ever! Love the simple ingredient list. We like them as muffins.
Buttery Cornbread#2#3#To much flour, not enough cornmeal.
Buttery Cornbread#3#1#I like this recipe, easy to make and tasty. I made a few changes: used Pamala's gluten Free baking flour; instead of sugar I used ½ cup monk fruit sweetener; and cut the butter to ½ cup. It baked up really nice. I think I will put some corn kernels in next time. 
Buttery Cornbread#2#0#This is delicious corn bread. I don't care what you want to call it. Thanks Nicole.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#The buttery flavor and soft crumb is wonderful. I always cut the sugar by half (or more) since my diet can't tolerate all of that. But give this a try! 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Love this cornbread! best recipe I've found!! Been using it for awhile.. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Love this cornbread. Followed recipe, added just a little more milk because I thought the batter was a bit thick
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Very good. I switch between this recipe
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Can this be made with sugar substitute
Buttery Cornbread#0#1#Have not tried yet! But had to commend Frances for the best comment I have ever read on a review!!!!! So so true!!! To each his own and let others enjoy or not without your opinion of what they like!!
Buttery Cornbread#1#1#Ok...so I thought this was very good and I'm from Virginia. I've decided that I don't like cornbread at all but love corn cake instead. We all have different tastes and I've found as I've gotten older that food I thought was good as a kid really wasn't that great!
Buttery Cornbread#0#2#Thank you, Nicole, for sharing what looks like a yummy recipe. I am looking forward to making exactly like your recipe stated.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Great recipe and my whole family loved it.
Buttery Cornbread#7#0#I am a New Englander. We've been making cornbread, corn cakes, Johnny cakes, and Indian pudding using corn since the time of the Pilgrims. No way is corn bread a one region baked good. Just like chili, barbecue sauce and pizza vary from state to state, region to region, so does cornbread. There's no right or wrong way to make it. It's what you grew up with, what your grandma made and what you came to love. Nowhere does this recipe claim to be southern cornbread. Or northern cornbread. Make your cornbread however you like, just don't tell me my way is wrong. 
Buttery Cornbread#2#0#I thought this was excellent. I live in the deep South and cannot understand the love for the dry, unsweet variety that is so prevalent here. (They don't call this Southern cornbread, so the folks who are up in arms about this not being real Southern cornbread should back off.) Must be my Northern roots, but this is some of the best cornbread I've had, and it makes a nice large pan of it, too. Warms up great! I found it sweet, yes, but not excessively so. 
Buttery Cornbread#1#0#My family is a huge fan of cornbread
Buttery Cornbread#1#0#Very good and sweet cornbread. Perfect with spicy main dishes!
Buttery Cornbread#0#1#this definitely is yummy but I do have to say it will be named corncake with a slash in my recipe file. I do wonder if people saying cornbread from the south is dry is because of #1) in the north they rarely use real good ole-bacon grease. and REAL buttermilk. so this is1. #2) most southerners that I grew up with counted on eating a slice from a cast-iron skillet( the best way to stay moist and have a crispy crust.) 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#The best cornbread recipe I've ever had! I made several copies so I can always find it easily. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Just a recommendation...I would add to the name Sweet Buttery Cornbread. I like looking at 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Corn bread is like pizza; there's no right or wrong. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#First time having cornbread and I loved it! Recipe was very easy to follow, I did reduce the sugar to 3tbsp as I was serving it with stew. This Scottish girl loved the finished result.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Great basic recipe!! I'm having mine with super spicy chili! Thank you!!! 
Buttery Cornbread#1#0#Very good flavor and texture. Easy to make. Nice sweet flavor. Will make again.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#My husband and I had this with a big pot of ham and beans. It adjust enough sweetness. It is a big recipe-13x9, so next time I'll probably cut in half. It tasted really good with the beans on the coldest night this year!
Buttery Cornbread#4#0#Excellent recipe. To all the Southerner commentors, get over yourselves. It is a matter of taste. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#1#I made it, it was easy to make, and I liked the buttery smooth texture and flavor. It complimented my 15 bean soup very well. Do I prefer corn bread without sugar? Depends on what mood I'm in, and what I'm eating it with. If I were having it with greens, I'd probably prefer the old fashioned (NO SUGAR) cornbread. 
Buttery Cornbread#2#1#This is how my husband makes his neighborhood famous cornbread - except he substitutes the last four ingredients for a package of Jiffy Cornbread mix! He also only adds three tablespoons of sugar, rather than a full cup, half a cube of butter, one egg, 1 teaspoon of oil, and it turns out great! Everyone loves it! So easy, he also uses whole milk.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I was curious about this recipe. 1 cup sugar! No way was I going to use that much sugar. Personally, I will go back to my 1 cup cornbread/flour ratio as family likes my old standby better, but I find it interesting to try new cornbread recipes.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This is the BEST cornbread EVER! I am a Northerner but my husband is not - and he says it can't be beat! I do substitute buttermilk for the milk but that is the only change I make. Like others have said, it is very moist and does freeze well. And if you have never had it with syrup - give it a try. You might like it! 
Buttery Cornbread#5#0#I am a southern cook, born and bred. If I added sugar to cornbread my sainted mother would be spinning in her grave. Also, buttermilk is essential in my cornbread world. However, with all that written, I have to say if this sounds good to you.....try it! If you like it, then I am happy for you and I respect your opinion. There is too much derision among us already. To each his own, in cornbread and in life. God bless us everyone!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#So good!!!! Try it!
Buttery Cornbread#2#0#IF YOU LET YOUR BATTER SIT FOR AROUND 20 MIN YOU WILL NOT HAVE GRAINY CORN BREAD
Buttery Cornbread#0#2#I made this exact recipe and it was too grainy and falling apart and too sweet. It wasn't horrible but it's not great corn bread either. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Great sweet corn bread recipe. I've made it twice sticking to original recipe. It does make a large amount so I froze a few pieces in freezer bags and used them during the rest of the week. You can defrost them or they reheat well in the microwave. Just a minute or less for a couple of pieces. This recipe is very much like the Krusteaz Honey Cornbread mix I usually buy. If you like sweet cornbread you'll definitely want to try this.
Buttery Cornbread#1#0#Love this recipe. It's the best cornbread I have had. It's better than the one they sell at Whole Foods. Most of the cornbreads I have had are dry. This won is kind of sweet and you can cut down on the sugar. I also used skim milk. 
Buttery Cornbread#1#0#I made this recipe gluten free the other night, and it was very good! Even my wheat-eating husband said it was quite good, and had several pieces. I'm making it again tonight! Yes, the texture is much lighter and fluffier than traditional cornbread, but for someone allergic to wheat it was really nice to get a soft, light bread that I can eat!If anyone is interested, I converted it by using my usual gluten-free flour and increasing the egg and baking powder a bit. I did cut it to a quarter-recipe for the two of us, and I baked it in a terra cotta bread dish which gave it a nice, crispy outside with a light, soft inside -- and as my husband noted, kept it warm at the table too! I used:2 3/4 Tbsp. softened butter1/4 Cup sugar1 large egg 1 egg white3/8 Cup plus 1 Tbsp. milk1/2 Cup plus 1 Tbsp. gluten-free flour1/4 Cup cornmeal1 1/2 tsp. baking powder1/4 tsp. salt 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#My significant other is in a Marine Corps League. He is in charge of their annual fundraiser which is a ham & bean (& cornbread) supper. Four years ago, we started making the cornbread for this event. Since we were to be serving masses, I searched for a traditional recipe that would make more than an 8x8 pan. I came across this and we got great reviews. The event has grown and several people have requested that we use the same recipe. I have not heard a single complaint. I just finished making 90 9x13 pans. And, by the way, it freezes well.
Buttery Cornbread#1#0#I cannot wait to try this... however, I would like to know what type of cornmeal this recipe calls for. There is corn flour - which I do not believe is the correct ingredient because it clearly doesn't say corn flour. But there is also fine grind, medium grind and coarse grind - each of which will produce a completely different result. I'm a free-spirit when it comes to cooking, but baking requires a different approach. I'm astounded that 144 people have had wonderful results, while I'm still trying to figure out which type of cornmeal to use. I've read all the comments and have only seen one reference to grind - Priscilla saying coarse grind may have made it grittier. (Thank you, Priscilla!) So I'm thinking medium or fine - and leaning towards fine. Can anyone who has tried this weigh in? Thanks! 
Buttery Cornbread#2#0#We all loved it; It had a wonderful flavor and great consistency very moist. I used a very coarse corn meal which I think I'll get a finer one next time but that's a small thing; it just made it a bit gritter than I would have liked didn't affect the flavor at all. 
Buttery Cornbread#1#1#Theeee best I've ever eaten! 
Buttery Cornbread#1#0#Made this recipe with two changes...I used 1/4 cup of sugar and cooked it in an iron skillet. According to my husband, it was the best cornbread he had ever eaten. So moist and delicious. This will be my go to recipe from now on.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I've used this recipe for years with rave reviews. Today I wanted to try making it in muffin pan so I appreciate the comments from those who have. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Absolutely wonderful flavor. I added a small handful of chopped pickled jalapenos and some cheddar cheese for a little kick. Will definitely be making this one again!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Excellent as is!!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Very good.
Buttery Cornbread#1#0#Just made this recipe this morning exactly as written. I cut the recipe in half and made 6 large muffins as someone else had done as it's just 2 of us. Baked for 18 minutes and they came out great. Yummy! 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I made this to go with Easter ham dinner. Everyone enjoyed it but mine was very dense. Not light and fluffy like some have stated. Still very enjoyable and moist the next day.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Dlboylan as long as you use a cup for cup replacement, it should turn out fine.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Would it be alright to replace the AP Flour with a Gluten-Free Flour Blend? Will it still produce desired results?
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I'm from the south and don't put any sugar in cornbread. So I made it without and it was really good. My mother always used some hot bacon grease in hers 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Yum. I cut back a little on the sugar and it was still plenty sweet.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Made as directed and was very good.
Buttery Cornbread#1#0#Great cornbread recipe. It's a keeper. 
Buttery Cornbread#2#0#This is the most delicious cornbread I have ever ate.!! This cornbread stays moist and is awesome with anything. mmmmm good.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Definite make again. I made only half the batter since there were only 3 of us eating it. I made 6 large muffins and baked about 18 minutes. They were so tender and slightly sweet. Yum
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#A good recipe, bakes up light and fluffy, but the next time I make it, I will decrease the sugar by half. Sweet: so depending on how you use it or what you pair it with may determine how sweet you like it.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Very good, moist , not overly sweet, light, made 1/2 recipe and put into muffin / cupcake paper cups only baked for 19 min. I will be making this again. I will not be using the recipe on the cornmeal package ever again.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Great cornbread. Moist, buttery, sweet. Some Southerners think they own the making of good cornbread but they don't. There's nothing wrong with sweet cornbread. I've had cornbread with no sugar, baked in a skillet with bacon fat and it's nothing to brag about. This recipe is now my go to recipe when I'm making cornbread. Two thumbs up! Add some jam and I'll fight ya for it. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#As a new bride I made corn bread & then asked myself, Why? It was dry & tasteless, so over the years I tried others & didn't change my mind. When I saw this in TOH in 2002 & tried it, it was just what I was looking for so have used it for years! My children & grandchildren love it, as well as others when I take it to potlucks. I don't change anything. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This is sooo good! It's perfectly light and fluffy. It's the best cornbread I've made! It's really not a cake as some said as cakes have Equal parts sugar and flour, ie 2 c sugar to 2 c flour. Comforting on a Cold drizzling winter day. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Made this as 18 muffins, will put some in the freezer to see how they do!
Buttery Cornbread#1#0#I normally eat healthy, but every once in a while I will treat myself to some good'ole fashion home cooking. This cornbread recipe I awesome! I made a pot of greens usi5n this cornbread recipe and felt like 8 was eating corncread cake! Yummmmmyyyyyy! 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#So, not the healthiest corn bread recipe, but it's SO good.This is my go to corn bread now. I have reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup a few times, it was still fine. 
Buttery Cornbread#1#0#Excellent- very moist. My husband tried it and said I think I like cornbread now . Many recipes are too dry, but not this one 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This isn't cornbread....more like cake, but then I'm from the South. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Easy to make, but too sweet for our taste. I'm going to try making it again using less sugar. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This is my youngest son's favorite corn bread. It's so fluffy and light. Honey butter is good on this bread. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Should have read other reviews before making it. Seemed like a version Jiffy cake mix..very similar.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I made this recipe tonight.It was devine!!I couldn't believe how moist it was, just delicious!I have to say it was a bit sweet, I will try with 1/2 cup sugar next time.Overall amazing!!!!Its a keeper! 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Excellent corn bread! Very moist. You do have to dirty a lot of dishes, though.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Deleted all other cornbread recipes.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Great Recipe always a dinner winner
Buttery Cornbread#2#0#This recipe deserves four stars. It is the only corn bread recipe I baked & served in both of my restaurant journeys... Moist, delicious& flavorful. Thank-you for this awesome recipe. ---ginger meeder
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Wow! I have used this recipe since I first found it years ago in a Taste Of Home magazine. My family loves this, especially when I use it as a complement to my chili.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I've been making this recipe for well over 15 years. We love it! It's on the sweet side. I've tried decreasing the sugar for my husband, but I think he just prefers my skillet cornbread like his mom makes. I've tried other recipes, but I always return to this one for the rest of my family. Yum! 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Very tasty! I made this to accompany a large batch of chili for casual gathering. They gobbled it up and asked for the recipe. I served it with honey on the side...yum! I think it was enjoyed so much because it is a bit different than the typical corn bread. I did decrease the sugar to 2/3 cup as suggested by others, but that was the only recipe change.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I Love This Recipe Real Crowd Pleaser, Made My day With My Dressing, Mmmmmmmmm, I'll do it Again... 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Pretty good! Came out golden brown and served it as a side dish with Red beans and rice. I used skim milk but otherwise followed directions. Next time I would decrease the sugar a little bit, maybe 3/4 cup, but otherwise no changes. Makes plenty!!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Best Cornbread EVER !!! If you're from the North you'll love it as is. If ya'll are from the South decrease the sugar to 2/3 or even 1/2 a cup, then sit back and prepare to enjoy the benefits of the most delicious buttery CornBread your mouth has ever tasted. Oh Happy Day...... 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Very good corn bread
Buttery Cornbread#1#0#I used half the sugar so it wasn't overly sweet for me, but it's corn meal / white flour ratio is off I think. It tasted more like a yellow cake than corn bread to me. Not great as a corn bread. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Pretty good. I followed recommendations to use melted butter, cut the sugar, & used buttermilk. I also made it 50/50, flour to cornmeal & soaked the cornmeal to eliminate any gritty taste. One thing I usually do to up the flavor is to add pureed corn, but I didn't have time. Next time! 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Way to much sugar for me. This is more like cake. Just needs strawberries and whipped cream.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#To me the cornbread is pretty dense and cake like as some of the other reviews mention. It is also very sweet too. A little too sweet for me. Good flavor and I don't regret making, just not what I look for in my cornbread. If I make again I'll cut down the amount of sugar. If you like your cornbread really sweet and cake like, this is the recipe for you. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Very good recipe, its my go to now.
Buttery Cornbread#1#0#I just love this cornbread. I served it during a get together at my home and everyone had positive comments and just loved it. I did change a few things; 1) substituted 1 cup flour with 1 cup cornmeal, 2) only used 3/4 cup sugar, 3) substituted 2% milk with butter milk, 3) did not cream butter with sugar, melted butter and added sugar and the directions where the same through out the procedures. I discovered that if you cream butter with sugar it will be more of a cake than cornbread. Same as substituting 1 cup cornmeal for 1 cup flour. You can try this if you want more of a bread texture than a cake. Still it's an excellent recipe... enjoy ...

Buttery Cornbread#0#0#EXCELLENT! I love this recipe- this is the best cornbread recipe and this is definitely going into my family recipe repertoire! Thank you for sharing!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#My go-to cornbread recipe! LOVE IT!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Yum! My husband doesn't like whole or creamed corn and it's hard to find a good corn bread recipe that doesn't use them. This is now our go-to corn bread recipe. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I like sweet corn bread and this one was perfect for me! Moist and not crumbly.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I have never had good luck with cornbread recipes until I tried this one. Delicious!! I did make a few changes, I used buttermilk instead of 2% and only 2/3 cup sugar. It turned out moist, sweet, buttery and absolutely the best ever! This will now be my go-to recipe!!
Buttery Cornbread#1#0#Perfect cornbread....moist and delicious. I did cut the sugar back to about 2/3 cup which still gave it a slight sweetness. Served it with ribs during football game and it got rave reviews!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Easy and great tasting recipe! Thanks for sharing
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This recipe makes the best cornbread my husband and I have ever tasted!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This was a great recipe. I used a 9X9 pan because I didn't have the size asked for. Baked it about ten minutes longer. Really a great, simple recipe. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I absolutely love this recipe I have been using it for years. I usually make 2-double batches at a time. I make muffins and mini cornbread loafs. Sooooo good. Don't be afraid to go a little light on the sugar I usually do about 3/4 cup or so. I found a great way to make it slightly more healthy. When doing a double batch i do 2 cups all purpose 2 cups whole wheat flour and then I split the remaining 2/3 cups between chia seeds and flax meal. If it's too wet I just add all purpose flour 1tbsp at a time. You won't be disappointed. Also, make sure all ingredients are room temperature it mixes so much more smoothly. Enjoy!! :) 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This was so delicious!! My husband said when I want him to make cornbread, this is the recipe he will be using! Thanks for sharing the recipe with my family and I!!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Always make this when serving chili.Thanks for sharing.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Delicious, it always get rave reviews! !
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Great Recipe!!!
Buttery Cornbread#1#0#Amazing! I did cut the sugar to 1/2 C - just personal preference. It was so moist and tasty! Thanks for sharing!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Very moist, great flavor. Really love the sweet flavor and cake like texture. Freezes well also.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#The best ever ,not dry at all had company over they said it was the best they ever had some even did not like corn bread said it is always dry but all asked for recipe
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Replace sugar with splenda
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#There is nothing worse than cornbread that is so dry and crumbly, it falls apart. This recipe is nice and moist and sweet, there's no need to douse it in maple syrup. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Very easy and super tasty! This cornbread is really moist and makes a lot so I think that it would be great to take to a potluck.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This is the best cornbread I've ever made! And I especially like that it uses ingredients that I always have on hand. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This is an outstanding recipe! I halved all the ingredients and decrease the sugar to 1/3 cup instead of using a 1/2 cup for the adjusted ingred. and baked in a 9X9 pan for 20 min. It was very moist and held together without crumbling. I will be making this from now on.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This is a delicious corn bread recipe. I made it in a 9x9 square baking pan and baked it for about 32 minutes and it came out perfectly. It was light and moist and buttery tasting. The boys fought for the last piece! 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Heavier than I'd like (which is why I didn't give it 5 stars), but the taste is good and it has good crumb. Maybe I need another 0.5t baking powder? 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Just. Plain. Good.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Wow, this is a fantastic cornbread. Light, sweet and moist!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Just Awesome. I too used less sugar, a sugar substitute that is, and more cornmeal. Perfect!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Tastes too much like cake and not cornbread. Has a good flavor - but if you are looking for cornbread, this doesn't really do the trick. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#So moist, it'll be nice to have this recipe for reliable, delicious corn bread! 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This is totally my new go-to cornbread recipe! Love it!!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup like others recommended. Fantastic! I might increase the amount of cornmeal next time.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This is the best cornbread I've had, and the recipe is perfect as is. I also made it using half the sugar, and enjoyed it just as much. 
Buttery Cornbread#1#0#The best corn bread ever. Every one that eats this corn bread wants the recipe. It is easy to make and is such a hit.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This was an excellent recipe; the best I think I've tried for corn bread. I'll be using this one from now on. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I halved the recipe because it's just my husband and myself. Wished now, after tasting it, that I would have made the full one. We will have leftovers for breakfast tomorrow morning. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This was definitely the real deal! Texture and flavor were perfect. I will make this one again and again.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Easy and makes a batch big enough for my ginormous family! I used buttermilk, as I was low on milk and had some buttermilk that needed to be used up. Delectable!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This was a very good recipe. We had it with a little butter and drizzle of dark Karo syrup and it was delish!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I recommended this recipe to my mom...she just made it for group of friends and they all raved about it.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#My family loved this. My husband calls it cornbread cake. I can't say that it is my new go-to cornbread recipe, but I will make it again. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#A simple, delicious recipe. I've made it twice, and will make it many more times to come! 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I've been making this recipe again, and again, and again... It's THAT good. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Very good! Super moist and flavorful.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#We made this for the first time tonight and I have to say I will not be trying any other recipes. THIS IS IT! Goodbye dried out box mixes, too. Over-the-moon good!!!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This is an amazing cornbread recipe! It is extremely hard to have only one piece!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Great recipe - I served with creamy wild rice soup. I also whipped 2 ice cream scoops of Country Crock butter with 3 teaspoons of honey. Even the few extra pieces were great the next day - heated up in the microwave to go with the leftover soup.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#easy and taste great
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#this is one of my keepers and it its the BEST!!!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Wonderful flavor and texture!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Excellent! My husband (not generally a corn bread fan) told me to save this recipe and use as my go to for corn bread in the future. Good as is, or with 2 jalapenos and 1/2 bag frozen corn! Thanks for sharing!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I made buttery corn bread to go with dinner and added some canned tomatoes with green chilies.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This is both delicious and simple to make. I took it to a chili/cornbread cook-off and one first place!!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Excellent!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This is the best corn bread! Moist and does not become a crumbly mess like some other recipes! Great with Chili!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Very nice texture & flavor. Definetly a keeper
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I reduce the sugar to 2/3 cup, reduce the flour to 2 cups, and increase the cornmeal to 1 and 1/3 cup. Tastes great! Next time I might use buttermilk instead of the regular milk.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Great Flavor!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#great texture and flavor. Very sweet.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Best cornbread ever! Love the sweet taste. I make giant muffins with the mix. Make this every time we want cornbread/corn muffins.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#We've made this recipe for years in our house. It is one of the best cornbread recipes I've ever tried. I can even make it gluten/dairy free with a lot of success. Halving the sugar also works well if you don't want it quite as sweet. Serve it with my Game Chili (http://heavenissmilingabove.blogspot.com/2014/12/game-chili-my-kids-cook-5.html) for a perfect and filling meal! 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Excellent tasting and easy to make! Mine turned out gooey in the middle even with an extra 10 minutes of baking time, but I'll just be more careful next time. Tasted great! 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Very easy and very tasty! Thanks for sharing it!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I followed the recipe as is. It is the best corn bread I've had. It is not overly grainy. I'm am very pleased and will keep this recipe. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I swapped out the milk for vanilla yogurt. Sooo good!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Tastes even better than the Krusteaz box mix. It's the best recipe I've tasted! 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Excellent! Moist, not gritty, just yummy!Even the batter is delicious!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This was my first attempt at homemade corn bread since we've been married. My husband and our dinner guest loved it! This is definately a keeper. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I have used this recipe for years. I bring this cornbread to family get-togethers and it goes quickly. It is not gritty, dry or grainy. The children in the family particularly love it and insist that their parents ask for the recipe. I suspect that they like it because it is a sweet and moist cornbread. I like pairing it with a spicy chili.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Very delicious! One of the best corn breads I've ever made! 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I accidentally forgot the flour, but it still came out very good. I loved how moist and buttery it was, and my kids love it. I'm going to make more today and remember the flour this time. We liked it with the 1 cup of sugar. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Great recipe !!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup I would not do that again. It was not sweet enough. I would also swape one cup flour for one cup cornmeal.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This recipe is delicious! It's like cornbread and cake in one. I made the exact recipe but in muffin form. We ate them up. Will make again. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#very good, I took the advice of previous comments and lowered the sugar to 3/4 cup. Either than that, the texture, sweetness and everything was perfect!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I made this recipe to accompany a family beef and vegetable soup. It was the perfect combo of salty and sweet! As other reviewers mentioned, it is very cakelike. I tasted the batter before pouring it into the baking dish and found it to be too sugary. I added 1/4 cup of milk to tone it down and it was just right when it was done. Next time, I'll do 3/4 cup of sugar instead of a whole cup but otherwise definitely a go-to recipe! Even my picky fiance LOVED it! 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This is the best corn bread I have found. I only make this one. My kids always as for it whenever corn bread is needed. My oldest daughter will NOT eat corn bread if she know I didn't make it. It is a great start for corn bread dressing. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I have made this cornbread several times. My family loves it and it's very easy to make.Elkton, Maryland 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This is a delicious, cake-like cornbread. We like it better with less sugar (about 1/2 cup).
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Great recipe! Very moist and it has a wonderful flavour compared to other bland corn bread recipes we've tried. Definitely a keeper we'll use over and over! 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Have made this many times over the years, tried and true. Our favorite cornbread recipe.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This was a huge hit with my family!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#The absolute best and most moist cornbread ever!
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This is a very good and moist cornbread. really liked the flavor. Only thing is too much flour - causing it to have too much of a cake texture. Next time I make this I think I will add less flour and more cornmeal. Overall a very good cornbread,better than any other recipe I've tried. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I have used this recipe exclusively since the 2002 Taste of Home Recipe book was delivered. We always have this with Ham'n Beans. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I have made this many times for my family. My kids LOVE this . . . we refer to it as corncake because it is so delicious. It reminds me of what is served at Marie Calender's restaurant. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#I've been looking for a good corn bread recipe. I've tried several others but nothin compares to this one. I added chopped jalepeno for the hubby though. All in all, 5 stars! Oh don't forget to spread butter! 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#my family loved this one.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This cornbread is A. Mazing. My whole family loves this recipe, it's the only one I'll make. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#The only cornbread I make! So moist and buttery! It puts traditional cornbread to shame.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This is my standard corn bread recipe, too. We prefer it a little less sweet so I decreased the sugar to 2/3 c. and that works well for us.
Buttery Cornbread#0#1#I've never heard of putting syrup on corn bread.  It does sound good though. 
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#This has became the only recipe I use for cornbread it is fantastic! I love it with honey or maple syrup:)
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#Wonderful! So moist and flavorful. A big hit with Christmas dinner.
Buttery Cornbread#0#0#So good, always a hit at our house. Really good with Pint beans or slow cooked chili.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#10#0#This is the best chocolate cake ever. I don't have room in my oven for three 9 pans, so I bought a pair of 8 Fat Daddio pans that are 3 deep. I use a very light coating of Wilton's Cake Release and wrap my pans to keep the layers evenly baked. I split the full recipe between the two pans and baked them at 350 for 45 minutes. Perfect layers. I like the icing recipe on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa powder container. It spreads beautifully and stays soft and creamy for the life of the cake. You can even pipe decorations with it. This cake never fails to please. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#2#0#Excellent chocolate cake, light tender layers with the right taste of chocolate. Easy to make in 9 inch layers or cut recipe in half and make 6 inch layers. Thank you Sandy!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#10#8#I made this gluten and dairy free by substituting a gluten free all purpose blend flour and adding xanthan gum. Used dairy free sour cream and Earth Balance stick butter. Also substituted German chocolate for the semisweet. The cakes were very moist and stuck to the cooling racks a bit, but overall it worked just fine. My dairy-allergic son said he was surprised at how good it was being gluten free. It was his birthday cake and was unsure at first about having it GF, but he had 2 pieces!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#14#11#I made this cake 3 times. Every time it became a German Chocolate Cake as I added a thin layer of homemade coconut pecan goo between each layer and on the top. This was the very best German Chocolate Cake ever! Nobody could put their forks down!! My sister owns a bakery and she asked for the recipe!! Said it was the best she has ever had. A huge compliment! I will make it again! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#8#1#This is the most amazing cake! Have made it several times-no wonder it's an award winner.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#17#0#This cake is fantastic. However, the frosting is missing an ingredient. My frosting is really thin. It's not as thick as in the video. Like another reviewer wrote, the frosting ingredients are incomplete. Please help. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#12#5#So, I really liked this cake, a lot! However, I totally forgot to add the water. I completely missed it! I really just thought the water was in the ingredients to melt the chocolate...duh!! My fault! So, for those of you that made brownies like me...this is probably why...lol!!!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#24#2#This message is for the lady who's family does not like mayo or some of the other ingredients, and is worried how the sour cream looked in the finished cake. You will in no way taste those ingredients in the finished cake, they are used for volume, moisture and texture, this cake should taste wonderful. This recipe is quite similar to how a red velvet cake would be made. I have an award winning chocolate cake recipe from good housekeeping magazine, that used vinegar for the rising agent and you would never in a million years believe that the cakes is made with vinegar! Try the recipe, your family will love this cake. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#3#0#This is one of my favorite chocolate cakes and really easy to make
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#10#3#This is my 4th year in a row baking this cake. It is outstanding!!! Don't forget to add boiling water or boiling coffee as your last step to making the batter. It's easy to read past it in the directions. This is my favorite chocolate cake and my husband loves having it every year on his birthday... also his favorite!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#2#6#I made this and took it to a party, and everybody seemed to like it. I have not tried it nor has my family because none of us like mayo, cream cheese or sour cream. I have made a chocolate cream cheese frosting that I was able to eat, but I was unsure of the sour cream in this recipe. Can anybody tell me how noticeable it is? Otherwise the cake looks just delicious.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#2#0#This is my new go to chocolate cake. It is just right. It's kind of a milk chocolate flavor, not a deep devils food chocolate. Just a regular chocolate cake, but excellent flavor and moistness.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#4#2#Wow I would love to try this cake- please post the ingredients in metrics measurements do I can bake this beauty !! Tia
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#1#So scrumptious!!!! Just what you expect from a chocolate cake! Will make it again!!!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#3#2#This was a very good cake. I halved the recipe and baked it in 2 6 rounds since there is only two of us and I don't want cake hanging around too long. It came out perfect. I had never heard of making frosting with sour cream, it was delicious not sweet like most. This will now be my only chocolate frosting I use. Thanks for the recipe!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#0#This recipe was amazing! I used a separate recipe for the frosting because I wanted a lighter color, but the cake itself was very moist and delicious.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#2#0#Absolutely delicious and relatively easy to make! My husband was in awe of the big beautiful three-layer cake for his birthday declaring it the best he'd ever had. I am not a big fan of cake, but I thought this one was really delicious. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#2#0#Best chocolate cake ever. Printed it and taped it inside my kitchen cupboard.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#2#0#I recently took this cake to a dinner with friends. It got rave reviews, as it was pretty and very moist. The frosting was good but not icky sweet. Will keep this one for sure.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#2#1#Not a fan of this cake. Was quite dense and tasted Like dark chocolate with all brown sugar and cocoa. The frosting was excellent.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#1#I didn't want to make a 3-layer cake, so I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a 9 X 7 Pyrex pan for about 25 minutes and it turned out perfectly. The cake is very good. The frosting was creamy and thick, but perhaps just a little bit too sweet. But overall, a great-tasting cake! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#6#0#This is a delicious cake but I have difficulty getting the layers out of pans intact and frosting it because it's so delicate. What am I doing wrong?
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#6#10#I only have two 8-1/2 pans. How do I adjust the ingredients and will it look bad with 2 tiers. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#0#This is my newest favorite cake! Delicious!!! I did make 1.25x the frosting so I could really load up the entire cake with extra frosting! Yum!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#0#The best cake. Will make again
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake is everything Sandy said it was! Worth the effort. It has become my go to when I need an impressive cake for a special occasion. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#2#I have a feeling the people who did not get a rise in the cake used baking powder instead of baking soda.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#4#0#Wow...this cake is amazing! I followed the instructions pretty closely, except I used brewed coffee instead of boiling water. I also added a raspberry filling between the layers. It was one of the best cakes I've ever made! This is definitely my new go-to chocolate cake. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Excellent, I put black currant jam between the layers as well. You only need a small piece. I will make this again. Janet VFE
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#2#0#The very best and now the only chocolate cake I make, there is no better!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#0#This was the best chocolate cake I've ever made. It was a hit with rave reviews. This is my Go To Chocolate cake love it! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#3#0#Wow, is right! A beautiful tall moist dense chocolate cake with wonderful rich chocolate frosting to die for. The frosting was just the right consistency to hide a small crack in one of the layers. The cake is going to my church homecoming tomorrow. I'll be lucky to bring home a crumb or two! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#16#0#Question. I only have 9 x13 cake pans. Does anyone know if this can be baked the same way? 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#4#1#Wow! I made this cake for the 4th of July (what's more American than chocolate cake, right?!) and it was a grand slam, home run with everyone! I made the recipe exactly as stated except I added a generous dash of cinnamon to the batter with the other dry ingredients. The cake came out exactly like it looks in the picture on the website. It is so delicious, I can't stop eating it! It's dense (I love dense cakes as opposed to light and airy, spongy cakes), super moist and full of chocolate flavor. The frosting pairs perfectly with the cake. The recipe made three full size, 9 inch layers, I just wrapped one layer in plastic wrap and foil and put it in the freezer for another day. The frosting was more than enough to generously frost two layers, and then have about a cup leftover. At first I was stumped because I never heard of leftover frosting before, not in my house! This frosting recipe left enough leftover for us spoon-loving-frosting-eating adults, and more for another time! I bet I could even frost 1/2 dozen cupcakes with the leftover frosting. So to sum it up, if you love rich, chocolately, moist, dense cake with tangy, sweet, chocolately frosting of which you will have some leftover, then make this cake! Thank you for sharing, Sandy! This cake recipe deserves that winning ribbon! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#5#1#I have made this cake many times, it always come out perfectly and I always get rave reviews. The people having problems probably didn't follow directions. Baking is a science, if you aren't exact in your measurements and use the right size pan it won't work.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Frosting 1/2 cup butter recipe stops WHATS THE REST OF INGREDIENTS?????
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#0#Excellent cake and icing. Super moist and flavourful cake and icing is perfect consistency. i bake mine in 2ea 9 round pans so i could do 4 thinner layers. As a professional chef, not pastry but still, i would say this is the best cake recipe i have found anywhere. If you want to go beyond the box cake mix and try something a little bit more challenging look no further. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Best chocolate cake ever! Made it for Easter and got rave reviews from some very picky people. Made my caramel frosting instead of the chocolate. Couldn't be happier with the outcome. Thanks Taste of Home! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Love this chocolate cake! Normally a die hard yellow cake fan, however, my childrens bday coming up
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#0#Mmmmmmmm... this cake was SO good and fluffy and soft! It was amazing. I put a raspberry frosting between the layers and frosted the outside with chocolate icing. I only had about 2/3 cup sour cream and was out of yogurt, so I substituted a tablespoon or two of cream cheese and filled up the rest with milk! Odd, but it worked well! I also only had 3 eggs, so I used 2 tbs of water with 2 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of canola oil (thank you internet!). I baked it for 23ish minuted and it was cooked thoroughly. Thank you for this recipe, it was amazing!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This made a large cake (3 big layers) and it was very good. Very intensely chocolate. The frosting was decadent. I am going to use it on other cakes that call for chocolate frosting. Recommend this recipe.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Absolutely loved this cake when is was in TOH magazine a few Christmas's back. Made it that Christmas and Im making it again.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#the full jam-packed chocolate cake just took my heart away... amazing recipe 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#0#I made it for my Grandma's birthday, I have never heard so many compliments in my life. Even one of my older sisters (who doesn't like chocolate), she had a piece and told me that it was the only kind of chocolate that tasted good. I had never felt so honored. I'm planning on making it on this oncoming Christmas for the rest of my family. :) But this is the best cake that I have ever made. &lt;3 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I just want to say that Shirley and vsailaway are WRONG. This recipe is, hands down, the best chocolate cake recipe I've ever used. The three cups brown sugar is NOT too much for a cake of this volume. My cake has always come out great. The only thing I change is I use cake flour, softassilk brand. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#8#I haven't made it but THREE cups of brown sugar - REALLY? I've always thought the one on the cocoa can was excellent - wouldn't make this one! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#7#Three cups of brown sugar? Is this a typo? I just threw this cake in the trash. It boiled over in the oven. It fell apart. I am an experienced cake baker. Not making this again. It tasted like pure sugar.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I've made this cake many time and I LOVE IT!! I can see why it won first prize. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#0#Fabulous flavor and texture. I love baking this cake and everyone loves eating this cake. I have a favorite chocolate buttercream icing I use, but this cake recipe is the BEST! Thank you Sandy.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Sandy is known as an excellent cook. Her cake always comes out great! Way to go Sandy.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#1#I was highly disappointed in the icing because I went exactly by the recipe and when I finished it it tasted more like sour cream and confectioners sugar I didnt enjoy it I wanted more a chocolate taste. :/
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Is it normal for the cake to boil in the oven? I'm baking it right now and it's boiling!: if This turns out good then I will rate it!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#1#I tried to make this cake but for some reason I ended up making brownies. I literally have no idea how this happened. From the other reviews, it seems like a good cake so I might just have to try again. At least I have a good recipe for brownies now.1* for finished product.5* for how funny it was when I took the brownies out of the oven.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#2#Tis cake is so like my aunt's scratch cake, but quicker! For the person who said it wasn't chocolatey enough, try replacing the water with strong coffee. I do this for most chocolate bake goods and people always mention the flavor being kicked up a notch from what they bake.! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#1#This cake recipe is delicious. I did not use the frosting recipe because I made a ho ho cake and tried the cake because I didn't have a chocolate cake mix. I used 3/4 cup of sour cream because that is all I had on hand. The cake was so moist and the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted. I baked it in a lasagna pan instead. Thanks Sandy for sharing your recipe.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#The frosting has a tangy taste to it. Kinda different but not bad.The cake is moist but lacks chocolate flavor.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I never make a cake that I thought came out well until this one! Great recipe. Easy and nice and moist! A keeper!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake is amazing and does make a large cake. I've made it twice now and the reviews were outstanding. Very moist and dense. Be prepared and have some cake lovers ready to help eat it! Could halve the recipe and have enough for a smaller crowd. I read one review that said it wasn't chocolatey enough or lacked chocolate flavor. So not true.... you can control the depth of chocolate flavor by the quality of the cocoa powder you use. Deep rich chocolate flavor with Scharffen Berger cocoa powder. This will forever be my chocolate cake recipe!!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#1#This made a really high cake it was over 7 inches when done, and it was nice and moist - but lacked chocolate flavour. I would probably not waste such expensive ingredients again, I have a sour cream chocolate cake which is better and less expensive
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made this cake for my family and I want to say that I loved it. It was delicious from the cake to the frosting. One problem I did have was it was a little dry and not as moist like I like my cakes. I don't know if I left them in the oven too long or what. I will try it again maybe with a little less flour the next time to see if that helps. Any advice would be appreciated. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I tried this once after stumbling across it. My family was amazed!!! Hard to find it again but so glad I did...wrote it down this time!!!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#1#I made this yesterday for my birthday cake. I used cake flour and subbed hot dark roast coffee in place of the boiling water, and also sifted the dry ingredients to be sure all of the lumps were out, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. After adding the hot coffee the batter was really thin. I've never made a cake with such runny batter before and was a little nervous about it. I baked 2 layers on the top rack and 1 on the bottom rack. The top rack cakes were ready at the 30 minute mark so I pulled them out.The cake that had been on the bottom rack was still liquid in the middle, so I moved it to the top rack and baked it another 7 or 8 minutes. The top of that 3rd layer had a funny darkened pupil-in-an-eyeball sort of center appearance, probably from the jiggling it received when I moved it to the top rack, but it was fully baked and unnoticeable once it was frosted. I made my own frosting (a butter & cocoa powder version) that I know is delicious, since some folks mentioned they didn't like the sour cream flavored icing much. The cake had a nice dense, moist texture and a great not-too-chocolatey flavor. It makes a huge cake; mine was 4 tall when assembled, so be sure to cut thin slices! I will save this to bake again- we shared a huge chunk with the neighbors and are still enjoying leftovers! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This recipe is perfect as written! I didn't change a thing and got fantastic reviews from friends and family! Exactly what I was looking for. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Loved by the whole family for my father's 70th birthday. I needed to make it dairy free so I used dairy-free margarine and sour cream in the cake and frosting. For the baking pans I always grease, line with parchment paper, grease and flour so the cakes come out effortlessly. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Cake was good, not the frosting. We didn't care for it at all. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Have made this many times with beautiful success, and currently have a halved recipe in the oven in 2 cake layers.For the not rising comment, I wonder how old the baking soda was or if toni used cold liquids. A quick tip to make sure that the cake has a good bake (or to make any cake bake well) is to have room-temperature liquids/soft solids. I allow the butter, eggs, and sour cream to get to room temperature before using them. I always keep my vanilla extract at room temperature. I also used cake flour and follow the tips on the cake flour box about how to compensate for all-purpose flour (it does make a difference for cakes, I promise.) While the batter does get more liquidy after adding the water, I wonder if Esteli had the oven pre-heated to the right temperature?If you don't prefer the frosting there are THOUSANDS of frosting recipes out there. Pick one that is highly rated by many people and try it. :) 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is a fantastic cake for carving novelty cakes. I used a bread knife and there were so few crumbs. I'm grateful for this recipe, as I had tried another with poor results. And I was practically out of regular sugar. Thankfully, I had these ingredients on hand. So my son ended up with a beautiful birthday cake that tasted delicious. It was perfect. Just a note to other baker's, after cooling and resting this cake seemed to compress a tad more than most other cakes (I used shaped pans, bit had to do carving to get it right. It was very worth it. The rocket cake had a tapered base and wide middle but the cake still stood firmly on its own. And the two baker's who tried the cake asked for the recipe. Thank you! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake was delicious. It's been a hit each time I've made it! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Won't let you down; fabulous, a keeper! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#0#Truly the perfect chocolate cake! If you are looking for an elegant chocolate cake for a special occasion, look no further. It tastes like heavenly fudge, looks beautiful in a cake dish, and cuts into nice slices without crumbling. Better than anything you could buy in a bakery! Thank you, Sandra Johnson!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake is awesome. I live at high altitude and had to make adjustments to account for that. I decreased the sugar to 2 1/2 cups, increased the flour to 3 cups, increased the water by adding an additional 1/3 cup and decreased baking soda to 2 1/2 tsp. I made cupcakes instead of cake. I usually let my batter rest for at least 15 minutes before baking. However, I made my first batch as soon as the batter was loaded and the cupcakes rose okay but spread a little. The batter that had a chance to rest made perfect cupcakes. They rose without spreading at all. It's important at high altitude to not fill the pans too high. I filled them to about a half to 3/4 inch from the top and it was perfect. Unfortunately there are no magic adjustments that you can use for every recipe. It's all trial and error at altitude, but my adjustments luckily were perfect for this recipe. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#The cake itself was excellent and I will absolutely make again. Very thick three layers and super moist. I was not thrilled with the frosting. It has a sharp taste to it possibly from the sour cream. It ended up tasting primarily like powdered sugar/sour instead of being chocolatey like I was hoping. Nonetheless I received many compliments and as some other commenters have said it does keep well for several days.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Awesome cake! Outstanding several days later as well! Didn't change a thing. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I baked the chocolate cake tonight and it is beautiful. The layers or high so it made a big cake. The flavor is great. The icing is wonderful and easy to make. I will make this cake again for Thanksgiving. I will post a picture on fb.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Hello everyone, I am not a pro in the kitchen but love to try recipes and eat delicious food. I followed this recipe exactly as above. The amount of water seems problematic to me, I put the amount indicated and the bater became so watery, but decided to give it a shot. After 35 minutes of baking the cake was still SUPER watery, so I put it an other 10 minutes, and still watery. It ended up staying in the oven for more than an hour until a toothpick came out clean. The cake came out actually kind of dry instead of moist. Can someone tell me what I did wrong?

Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I followed the direction closely, the cakes did not rise at all. I have googled reasons why it would not rise and baking powder was mentioned many times. I see all the great reviews but cannot find out why mine flopped so bad.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#0#This was the most delicious chocolate cake - I didn't change a thing. The flavor and moistness that the sour cream gave it was unlike any other. It kept for several days before even beginning to get slightly dry, which is definitely worth a of a five star rating in my book! Will definitely make again! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I luv this cake
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#sandy u never fail to amaze me i luv this cake
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Just made this cake over the weekend for my husband, and for the cocoa powder I used Hershey's Special Dark. The cake was so moist, and my family loved it! It's definitely been added to my recipe collection. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Tasty and yum want eat
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#My family declared this the best chocolate cake ever!! I used my own homemade frosting. Sift 1/4 cup cocoa powder, 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 dash salt and cream with 1/4 cup Crisco or butter. Add 1 whipped egg white. A great recipe - would not change a thing about the cake.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Haven't baked it yet, but wondering if using cream cheese instead of sour cream would improve the taste of the icing as I read the one baker mentioned she did not receive a good report of the frosting. I have both ingredients always, may try first the sour cream way. Not waiting for a birthday to bake it either! Sounds luscious! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I took this to a special choc cake contest at the Polk County Fair Saturday and it took first place. Its excellent I would highly recommend. I baked it exactly as the recipe was written.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#this is one dynamite cake. If you haven't tried it, please do. You can't go wrong!!! I never use coffee,just follow the recipe. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#i see that people are substituting coffee for the water. When do you add coffee/water? I don't see it in the instructions. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Made this cake for my husband and he ate almost all the cake, fudgy and delicious. I too used coffee instead of water, wonderful texture and crumb. Will definitely make this again...
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#0#This cake turned out great! Really moist and fudgy. I did take others suggestions and use coffee instead of the water. I can't rate the frosting though. Some people said it tasted strange and I couldn't risk my picky eaters' b-day cake tasting weird... 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Perfect chocolate cake recipe. I used half of all ingredients and used a bundt pan. It looked beautiful garnished with ganache and strawbwrries.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#ronnir1 I use a 9X13 pan all the time to bake my cakes and I always use 350. Hope this helps
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#What temp and time would you use for 9x11 cake or is it 9x13? Sounds great
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#0#Coffee seems to enhance the taste of chocolate so I tried this cake with some espresso and OMFG it makes this cake as if it was made from one of those best high dollar bakeries you always want to try but could never afford! LOL I did tweak it a little hear and there in a few other places as well to make it mine. Used Irish butter because after all I am Irish. An Irish woman married to a Mexican. Believe me, I am paying for it in spades. My daughter is giving me fits by way of showing me her temper at times --- who would have thought a half Mexican half Irish kid would have had much of a temper *coughcough* but she absolutely loves this cake too!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This recipe is like the Hershey chocolate cake recipe except for sour cream. I've made the Hershey numerous times and it's wonderful so I'm sure this one is too 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Now this is what chocolate cake is all about! Rich & Oh soooo decadent. One of the best recipes ever and not too difficult. Thanks for sharing, Sandy!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have tried a lot of chocolate cake recipes and this one is by far the best. It also makes quite a bit of cake. This is the only recipe I use for chocolate cake.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Taste great my family lived ut
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I just wonder why so much sugar? it is a little too much from my point of view.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Cake is dense with deep rich flavor. Icing is complex. Together it's a little too rich. Next time I'm going to make it with butter cream frosting. This cake shows pretty and serves 16-20 easilt. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made a version of this cake for mothers day. It is truly one of the best cakes we have ever had, all while being easy to make. Thank you for this recipe!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Unbelievable! Super moist and full of flavour! Love it!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake is amazing. It doesn't last long around this house!!! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Easy to make. Tasty. I halved the recipe and made 18 cupcakes. Baked for about 22 minutes. They were a little too full. Next time I will make a few more so they don't overflow. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Excellent cake. I use cake flour and substitute hot black coffee for the hot water. I have tried other substitutions but they do not improve the cake. This is a very rich cake because of the sour cream, so a small piece of cake is very filling. To keep the cake tender, go easy on the mixing and get the cake in the oven as soon as the mixing is complete.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Made this cake this weekend, wonderful. It is not a fluffy cake but a moist fudge texture . I was hoping for a much richer chocolate flavor. The frosting goes on smooth and make the frosting cake look nice. I will definitly make this again but next time I will add expresso powder to the cake.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#5 stars doesn't cover it! This was the most amazing cake. This was the first time I made a cake from scratch. My daughter requested it for Christmas. So moist and fudgy. You will not be disappointed! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Just made the cake for a birthday in a Darth Vader shaped cake pan and it came out beautifully and made a dozen cupcakes with the leftover batter. It's very moist and was such a hit. This recipe is definitely a keeper! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Looks very similar to the one on the Hershey Cocoa Powder can. My mom make it all the time. I am looking forward to see how this recipe compares.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Best cake I have ever made.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is absolutely the BEST chocolate cake I have ever had. It is totally worth the effort. Thank you so much for sharing!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Everyone in my family agreed this was the best cake they'd ever had. I made just a few adjustments. I added in a tsp each of espresso powder and cinnamon and I just made a simple ganache frosting because I was out of powdered sugar. Will make again and again! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Any idea on how many cups of batter this makes?
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is an amazingly moist cake. And the icing is the easiest icing I've ever worked with. I did sub the sour cream for cream cheese but it turned out phenomenal. Definitely the ultimate chocolate cake. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I agree with others. This is THE perfect chocolate cake and my new go-to recipe for birthday and other special occasions. I've never had good luck with layer cakes but this one worked perfectly. First time I forgot to add water (love the idea of using coffee instead of water) but it still turned out fine. Second time the batter at the bottom of the bowl did not get mixed well and it STILL turned out okay. Each time I spread raspberry preserves between layers and on top prior to frosting. Love the silky smooth frosting. Then I made genache and poured it over the top--so rich and yummy. Can't wait to make another one!!! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I baked mine in a Bundt pan omitting the icing. It is the BEST chocolate cake recipe I've ever tried. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#1#0#WOW... what can I say. Pulled out my cake from the oven about 3 hours ago and there is nothing left... DELICIOUS.... I did do a slight change. Instead of plain boiling water I used fresh brewed coffee.... Got to go, making another one.... thanks.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Hi just wondering if I can use buttermilk instead of sour cream in this receipe ?? Very keen to try this chocolate cake version
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Came out perfectly . A very delicious chocolate cake , however not too happy with frosting and may put some cream cheese or something to it the next time.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Perfect. Light and Fluffy
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made this cake in a 9x13 pan. It took about an hour to bake. This is such a good cake. I am not a big fan of frosting so I didn't frost it and it sure didn't need it. Good job! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Best simple chocolate cake ever...........easy and yummy......5 stars easily
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#The cake is great! One of the best chocolate cakes I've ever had. However, I am surprised how many good reviews there are on the frosting. I didn't like the taste of it. Others I served it to liked it, but I could taste the sour cream. I think a homemade buttercream would be delicious on this cake! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake and frosting are absolutely delicious! It tastes even more delicious the second day. I made cupcakes for a large birthday party. It makes 48 cupcakes. A
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#One of the best ever among choc cakes. But sandy or anyone please tell me what's the ingredient(s) in this recipe that makes it stand out from an average choc cake? 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is undoubtedly the absolute best chocolate cake and frosting I've ever tasted. I ended up having to add an additional cup or so of powdered sugar. I sifted the sugar before measuring and probably shouldn't have - it didn't say to. I was afraid it might be lumpy if I didn't. Sifting probably made it not fill the measuring cup as full when measuring. Sandy, I can see why you won the contest.When reading the recipe, it had a few things completely different from all the methods I've ever used and made me want to try it to see how it turned out. It is absolutely wonderful 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#The first time I baked this, I forgot to add the boiling water. I thought it would be really dry, but it was still surprisingly delicious! Currently have this recipe in the oven with the boiling water added. This consistency after adding the boiling water worried me. It seemed a little too liquidy than other cake recipes I have made. Is this normal?
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made this and it turned out delicious! It was easy to follow and I will be making this again. My family love it!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Best cake ever! Been making this one since 1985 (it's a Mable Hoffman recipe, first showed up in the Ladie's Home Journal that year). I also often will freeze the third layer, and tote the other two to whatever event needs a great chocolate cake. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This was a yummy, moist cake. The frosting threw me a bit. I think I will use cream cheese in it next time. Overall, good, easy to follow recipe the turns outs beautifully
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#What is sour cream....?...can we adjust it with yoghurt
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#PeggyCamp16, baking cocoa is Cocoa Powder. It is unsweetened and in the baking section of the store.As with a few other reviews, I always substitute coffee for the water--it enhances the chocolate. You will not taste the coffee.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Is the baking cocoa, for the cake, semi-sweet or unsweetened?Thank you! PJ
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made this cake for a potluck luncheon. I put a layer of vanilla cream pudding between the layers. It was a big hit at the potluck! This cake is very rich and dense.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Beautiful, moist cake. It's my new go-to chocolate cake recipe when I don't want to make a flourless cake and I don't want to make one with a brownie/decadence density. One thing I do is add espresso powder, though. It's almost a knee-jerk reaction for me to find some way to add more flavor to a baked item that requires water than simply adding water. Substituting the water with hot coffee or just adding a teaspoon or so of espresso powder to the boiling water is a great way to accent the chocolate flavor. Wonderful recipe! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#One of the best chocolate cake recipes I've ever followed! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Best chocolate cake ever. Moist delicious and looked beautiful... Will definitely be my go to cake...
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#So long chocolate store box cake. This cake was very moist!! I will definitely be making it again the the future. The frosting was a little sweet for us so I will just cut back on the confectioners sugar next time but a great recipe!!!!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#1#I made this for my husband's birthday party since he requested chocolate cake, and everyone raved about it. There were 10 people at the party and we still had lots leftover, even though some guests had seconds and thirds! It tastes so much better after being refrigerated overnight. I highly recomend this recipe!Note: I used only semisweet chocolate since i didn't have unsweetened, and it still tasted wonderful - not too sweet. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Followed recipe as written; the cake was moist and delicious. Would definitely make again. Only change I would make is to line bottom of pan with parchment or waxed paper to make it easier to remove from pan.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Divine! This has become my go to chocolate cake recipe.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Hands down the BEST chocolate cake we have ever made. My daughter and I made this as the centerpiece of our family holiday meal and it did not disappoint. The frosting is on the sweet side but it balances the cake. We made the cake with coffee instead of water and it was wonderful. First dessert to go on a well stocked dessert table :) This recipe is a keeper.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#One of the best. Everyone loved it.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#So decadent! I made this for my Sweetheart on his birthday. We had 17 guests. Everyone raved about how velvety smooth is was. My house smelled like chocolate for hours on end. I found it to be rich but not heavy. Amazing chocolate flavor. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#My cake turned out heavy and didn't rise. I loved the frosting but I obviously did something wrong as it was not fluffy, but more solid, like the texture of clay. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This will be the only chocolate cake recipe I make from here on out!! So delicious AND beautiful!!!THANK YOU!!!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#my family loved this Chocolate Cake. It is a very large cake so today I made it again and cut everything in half and put it in a 9 x 13 cake pan. It turned out just a great as the first time I make it. It is our family's new favorite cake. Thanks Sandy 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Very moist and delicious , perfect chocolate cake recipe!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made this cake the other day and passed out pieces to my friends. Now everybody wants the recipe. Excellent cake JUST THE WAY IT IS. No changes needed!!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I shared with family and friends. They said it was the best chocolate cake they had ever put in their mouths!! Will definitely make it again!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Made this cake for my husbands birthday...followed directions exactly as written and it turned out perfectly! I did not use the frosting, my husband requested a different kind (coconut), but I look forward to trying the frosting out in the future.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake is wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly except I only made 2 round cakes instead of 3 and it was perfect!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Excellent, good for a crowd.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I'm rating 5 stars because it's really delish, but I would not take mine anywhere because of how it looked. The layers rose in the oven but sunk in the middle as they cooled. And, no, nothing happened to make them fall. What could I have done wrong?I think I packed the brown sugar too firmly because it took forever to cream with the amount of butter and to me, never got the fluffy texture. So, would overbeating have done it?Thanks for your input.Thanks 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is the best chocolate cake I have ever baked. It has become my friends and family's favorite. I melt a bar of bittersweet chocolate and spread it each layer and then top it with the frosting. I gives it a slight crunch with a burst of chocolate. Yummy!!! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Amazing cake!!!! I made this cake for the first time and it is wonderful!! My husband and many of the individuals that we shared with stated that it was the best chocolate cake that they ever had. I totally agree and will make it many times again. It is one of our favorites. Also, I agree with other reviewers, each layer of cake is a nice size and there is plenty of icing to coat the whole cake nicely.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Loved the consistency of the cake and the frosting was very easy to work.The cake is not as sweet as a typical cake due to the brown sugar, but rather, has a very rich, complex flavor and is wonderfully dense. If you have to bring a showstopper dessert to impress your friends, fire up the oven.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Easy enough to make... and very professional and glamorous looking (a real showpiece!). I thought cake was a little dry . Frosting was good, but I've made better with less expensive ingredients. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I am a eleven year old girl I used your resipy to make cupkakes and I got first place. Thank you so much ^.^
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Makes a very tall cake with perfect amount of frosting for between and over the cake, will make again!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This Cake was Amaazzzing!!..made it for a graduation party as cupcakes with a brown butter cream frosting and people could not stop raving about how good it was!! It's definitely a must try!! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#1#Frosting was good.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I see that the cake is amazing but it say servers 16 i would like to make it for 10 , may be still smaller. How do i get the correct measure of ingredients. Please anyone, let me know
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This dreamy, extremely rich chocolate dake is the bomb! Tasted like it was made by a professional cake baker, provided 12 good-sized tasty slices. Very rich, extremely smooth frosting. The brown sugar cake baked precisely and was a good foil for the extremely rich icing. I made this cake exactly as instructed. Is the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake wasn't great it was awesome. Totally delicious we kinda ran out of baking cocoa so we had to add chocolate chips. And we changed the brown sugar to 1 cup and 1/2 of cup of white sugar. Still went out great my parents said it was really moist thank you for creating this recipe. :) 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is a fabulous cake. It's almost as good as my go-to chocolate cake recipe. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#My five stars is for the frosting. WOW!!! I've never tasted better. I have the feeling that the cake is just as good, but because I live at high altitude and have no idea how to alter cake recipes to rise properly, I did not make the cake. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Very moist, exactly what I was looking for.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Love the chocolate lay flavor without being too sweet
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I chose this recipe as my maiden voyage into the from scratch baking world. I received a mixer for Christmas and have been nervous about trying it out. I have never been much of a baker but at the age of 55 i decided to go for it. I made a big mess in the kitchen & ended up with dry cake mixture all over the place & myself, and despite trying to be careful I made the same big mess while mixing the frosting. Nonetheless, the cake turned out beautifully in spite of my inexperience. I had a ball, but must admit - it was a lot of work. Hubby said it was worth it,but he didn't do anything but eat it, LOL. Good recipe-particularly love the frosting. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This really is the BEST chocolate cake! I'm throwing away all of my other chocolate cake recipes. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#The best chocolate cake I have ever had!!!! It was absolutely amazing!! I made this for my moms birthday cake and everyone loved it!! I wouldn't change anything about it! Thank you for such an amazing recipe!!! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Decadent. No need to say more.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I'm a sucker for chocolate cake, but was surprised to see the hot water is added at the end of mixing the batter. I use Hershey's special dark cocoa and I always'pre-disolve' the cocoa with hot, strong coffee. Then I add it to the batter, making for a super dark cake. The only change I made in this recipe was taking 1/3 cup water and replacing with hot coffee to dissolve my cocoa powder. Delicious cake!! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is one the best if not the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted or made!!!! I always use a little extra chocolate in all my recipes plus I used pure Mexican vanilla in this recipe. Thanks for sharing, Sandy!!! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made this for Christmas and it was so, so, good!! Too much for my husband and I but we finished it 4 days later and pounds heavier!! Truly a wonderful cake! Thank you for the recipe. Oh, and the frosting was THE best ever!!!!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Wow! Rich and moist and chocolate pow! I think this is the best scratch cake recipe I have tried yet. I am not a baker, so I steer clear of those recipes calling for cake flour and super careful measuring. The hot water part scared me a little but I followed the directions exactly and it was perfect. The amount of frosting is very generous, and my husband thought it was perfect even though it was a little too sweet for my taste. I will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing this, I can see why it won a prize!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is truly the most delicious chocolate cake I have ever tasted. It's rich and creamy. I will be making it for Christmas Eve. I have no doubt it will be a hit. Thanks you for sharing. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#AMAZING CAKE!!!!!I just made this cake 2 days ago !My husband's coworkers loved this cake!!!I used 3 cups of cake flourI didn't have enough sour cream to prepare the frosting so I used half cup of sour cream and half cup of philadelphia cream cheese and it was DELICIOSO!!!!Thank you for such a good recipe!!! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Best chocolate cake recipe in a long time. Easy to make and a big WOW effect at the table :) I put some sour cherry jam between the layers. Goes great with the sweet chocolate. Thanks for sharing this recipe Sandra, I will make another one for christmas eve :)
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is absolutely fabulous! It is very moist with a creamy chocolate frosting that is quite addicting. I used cake flour and it turned out great. This is a show stopper and special enough for a holiday dessert. Yum!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Perfect recipe!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I consider myself a serious cake baker, and pride myself in knowing a great cake from just a good one. Great chocolate cake recipes are very hard to find. This is a great chocolate cake recipe. I made it with cake flour because I didn't have any AP flour. It turned out super, it was moist but not heavy , just light. The flavors were well rounded but not too sweet and the texture was super. I believe the brown sugar and the sour cream really set it apart from any other chocolate cake I ever made. This one was perfect. I didn't perfect the frosting but the cake is definitely a keeper . 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This was on the cover and pg58 of the latest issue and I decided to try it for a formal dinner dance I was attending. I was pleased that I had all the ingredients and that the directions were very simple. It was easy to make and then when i put it together the next day it came together beautifully--best frosting. So yummy! It was so fancy when sliced and displayed and all my close friends were demanding slices as soon as they saw it. My dessert was the first to go and EVERYONE declared it to be one of the best chocolate cakes they had ever had. The balance of the sour cream with the sugar kept it from being overwhelmingly sweet and it was more old school in recipe without the white sugar and with the boiling water and sour cream. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet bakers chocolate. The frosting is plentiful and delicious. And for a garnish, I crushed up some chocolate chips and dusted the top. It was a massive hit. Everyone declared it to be so moist and to taste like it came from a bakery. Definitely an awesome cake. Will be making it again for Thanksgiving.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#this was really good. very easy to make. will need to make it again
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is my go to chocolate cake! I've made it many many times. For Birthdays I just make a buttercream frosting so I can make it fun colors. The only thing I ever alter is the type of frosting. LOVE LOVE LOVE! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Excellent. I reduced the recipe in size so I only made one layer with no frosting so I could test it. I live at a high altitude (4600 ft). I wouldn't make this cake without adjusting for altitude as it is so tender that it would cave in if it weren't adjusted. I removed a 1/4 of the butter and 1/4 of the sugar. It turned out great. Other than that, it is very tasty. It will be my go to chocolate cake recipe.Oh, I'm not a fan of sour cream. I used the sour cream in the cake with very good results--but I didn't use the frosting recipe though, as I didn't think I'd like it. Instead I used a cocoa buttercream frosting from an old Betty Crocker cookbook. I put whipped cream in the frosting instead of the milk and then whipped it. Very fluffy. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made cupcakes, first the cake boss (all without frosting) and then sandy's. I had my daughters and husband taste both, sandy's won! I didn't even have to put frosting on them. I like to make cakes for people on the side, now sandy's recipe will be my chocolate cake recipe in my cake book 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Made this for my husband for his birthday!! He loves chocolate and this cake made his birthday. I found it was a very easy recipe and does not require a whole lot of work considering its from scratch.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This cake was delicious. It was so beautiful the frosting was sweet and creamy. It is a great recipe.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have made this cake several times! It works great for cupcakes too. I even won a couple of work Bake-off competitions. This one is definitely a keeper.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have made this recipe for my two daughters birthdays since 1993. They request it every time and it is now known as THE birthday cake in our family!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Best Chocolate cake I've ever had, My family raved about it and said they want it for every birthday. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving. It came out perfectly just like the picture, but because I was taking it to my sis in law for dinner I iced two layers and kept one home for my family and boy am I glad I did. My in-laws devoured it and gave it very high scores. I will definitely make this again, again, and again...it is a must for the holidays. Thank you Sandy...thank you!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#My favorite cake ever!!!!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#My favorite cake ever!!!!!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#First time I have written a review and I have tried ALOT of recipes for chocolate cake online. Husband is a chocoholic and complains I haven't made a really great chocolate cake..much to my bruised ego... but this recipe is fabulous made exactly as written here. Light and moist and looks great as well. Perfect chocolate flavor. Thanks Sandy! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is one of the best chocolate cake I have even make. It is fool proof. I use if for everything. You can never go wrong with this one. Thanks for the great recipe
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#We all enjoyed this cake. I did the math and made it a two layer cake for our small family. Worked just fine.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I have made this recipe many times and ALWAYS get great reviews..very moist and flavorful. Thanks for sharing.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Wonderfully moist and delicious chocolate cake. I reduced the 10X sugar to 41/4 cups and the icing had just the right sweetness.
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made this for a teacher's birthday. Everyone, including the 1st graders, loved it! It's a very easy recipe to follow and turns out just like the picture. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#The frosting was awful, way to sweet; in fact my husband and I had to eat around it. I will keep the cake recipe, it's very moist, the frostings got to go.Tamara CarrPinole CA
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#The best chocolate cake I've ever made. I made this for our family of 8 on Valentine's Day 1996, and we shared it with friends who are still talking about it. It's easy to make and well-worth the effort. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#So yummy...cut small slices because it's rich. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made this cake and it was such a big hit, I have had to make it several times over for friends. This is the best chocolate cake I have had, it is so moist and good that beware it WILL get you into trouble. My boss says this is the best chocolate cake she has ever tasted as well. Thanks for sharing
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#I made this cake the other night. Takes a little time but the results are fabulous! The finished product taste kinda like a fudge brownie! Yummy!
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Delicious and very moist cake. I usually don't risk trying out a new recipe for company, but since it won a contest over 59 other cakes, I made it and took it to a party and everyone loved it! 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#Outstanding! I made this cake for my husband's birthday and it was a huge hit. We love very nice restaurants and this reminded us of a dessert there. Just add a dallop of real whipped cream and you have an elegant dessert. Cut the pieces thin because it is rich. This is a new family favorite. Deena 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#This is the best Chocolate Cake I've ever tasted. Making another one to send to my Son's house for Easter dinner. Thank you Sandy. 
Sandy's Chocolate Cake#0#0#very good cake
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Fabulous! Friends said it was restaurant quality. The only thing I did was double the chicken broth to make more sauce....and sprinkled a little flour to thicken slightly
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#So happy the sauce is homemade instead of using canned soup which is full of things I don't want to put in my body. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was great! Might add a pinch of cayenne to the flour next time.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#2#0#My husband usually hates chicken breast because it is white meat and would prefer dark, but he always raves about this dish. the chicken is so tender, it is amazing!!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#5#3#Hubby and I found this recipe was a 5 star. I did add a few things which is very much what I always seem to do. First, I didn't have the chicken breast, so I used the chicken thighs. I didn't skin or debone them, I used them as they were, just made sure I cooked them long enough. Second, I also added some seasonings to the flour, onion powder, garlic powder, & Italian seasoning along with S&P. Third, to the broth I added the juice of one lemon. Right now I seem to have a lot of lemons and I like using them whenever I can, they seem to brighten the flavor. Because there is only the two of us this recipe has given me two nights worth of dinners ( cook once, eat twice ). 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#14#8#This is such a great recipe for chicken. I used 1 cup of broth, because 1/2 cup just did not seem enough. I added diced potatoes to the mushroom mix. I cooked it the same amount of time, and the potatoes were done. That extra 1/2 cup of broth made gravy for the potatoes. I will be making this again.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#3#1#This was absolutely delicious! I am sick of grilled chicken at this point in the summer and wanted something different. I had mushrooms I needed to use when I stumbled upon this recipe. Since it makes 4 servings, my husband and I have leftovers for another night. I can't wait!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#3#2#My new go to chicken recipe. I double the mushrooms & butter and add a 1/2 c. white wine to the broth. We like lots of gravy to serve with the mashed potatoes I serve with this along with either green beans (my husbands favorite) or corn. Great meal that is quick & easy.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#5#1#This has become one of our favorite go to recipes. It's flavorful, healthy and easy to prepare. If I am serving it with riced cauliflower (a very healthy swap for rice), I double the mushrooms and broth and add a little flour to thicken slightly so that we can spoon that goodness over the riced cauliflower. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#1#0#This was so simple but soooo good!! I did add a little garlic salt but other than that I followed the recipe!! Big hit!!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Very delicious. Loved it. Would not change anything.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#We love this recipe! I will put it in my meal rotation. I loved the fact that I could clean up each step while the next step was cooking as well as preparing a tossed salad. I had a clean kitchen when it came out of the oven. I served it with the salad and roasted Yukon gold potatoes. Delicious!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#2#0#My husband took one bite and said this is good! . He expected the typical dry chicken breast. it is so moist and tasty, We loved it. Yes, we added about 3 times more mushrooms and some more green onions, want to try next time with spinach. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Great combination of ingredients that together make a wonderful meal.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Very good and moist. I will make this recipe again.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#1#0#I give this recipe an A+! Yummy, yummy, yummy!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Delish! Such an easy recipe, yet so good! My husband loved the mushrooms...and I did put extra in the dish.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#7#2#Family loved it. I am diabetic so I altered the recipe by using almond flour instead of regular flour. Deglazed the pan with white wine then sautéed shallots, garlic and fresh spinach along with the mushrooms. Calculated one serving @ 196 calories. 8 carbs is respectable without the math.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#1#0#This is a fan favorite in our house. My kids ask for it all the time. It's a very simple recipe with a lot of flavor. The only things I do different is use a lot more mushrooms and a little bit more of the mozzarella cheese because my family loves both. I love to serve this alongside some fresh steamed or roasted asparagus and smashed redskin potatoes. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#My go to now. Always elegant to serve. Easy and tasty.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#1#1#Very nice! I loved that it was quick to make. Following ideas from other reviewers, I sliced my large chicken breasts (2) in half. That worked well. I also added 1/4 C white wine to the sauce, and the little remaining flour left after dredging the breasts to thicken it a little. I was heavy on the mushrooms, cause we love them. I added some snipped fresh rosemary and chives to the sauce because we love fresh herbs. I served over zucchini noodles and asparagus that were sautéed in olive oil, garlic and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese. It was delightful. The only change I will make next time is to double the sauce. We would have enjoyed more over our zoodles . Would serve this to company! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#4#1#Ok, I just made this. I didn't have any green onions so had to leave them off. Still very, very good! Thanks to Gail for the idea to cut the chicken breasts in half. Worked perfectly. There's nothing about this recipe I would change. Thanks for sharing! I should say I rarely create accounts on websites, but I did here just to rate the recipe. :-) 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This has got to be one of my favorite baked chicken dishes. It is easy and doesn't seem like it would be that flavorful but it is! So glad I tried it. Whole family gave it a thumbs up. Make sure you use every drop of mushroom sauce on the chicken breasts, and we used a good amount of green onions because we like them. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#1#0#Very tasty! Instead of pounding the chicken breasts, which were large, I sliced them in half, which worked well. I also used a heavy hand with the mushrooms, because I like them.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Delicious!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Restaurant quality!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Made this last night - so easy - so good.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Uh, so this is phenomenal. The only change I made was adding some white wine to the skillet with the mushrooms. So so good.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#My whole family loved this recipe. The chicken was so tender. A very easy recipe to make. It is definitely a keeper.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#My husband's comment with the first bite? This is delicious! My favorite taste tester food judge really liked this dish and so did I. I followed the recipe ingredients exactly other than upgrading by using portobello mushrooms. Procedure-wise: I sliced two 8-oz. chicken breasts lengthwise rather than pound them to 1/4 thickness. Doing that saved a little effort and it did not at all impact the taste. This recipe can make a novice cook look like a seasoned pro. It was flavorful, juicy and the two of us could have easily eaten the other two servings. :) I will definitely be making this again. I liked the idea shared in the reviews of sauteing the onions. I'm also toying with the idea of using half chicken broth and half white wine for the sauce mixture. To answer Lousey Cook in Texas' question: I don't know that it would taste as good as making it fresh. The breading on the chicken might get a bit soggy. You could try it but it really doesn't take long to put this all together. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Can this be prepared the night before so all I have to do is bake it?
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Alice - look at step 3 !!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#1#9#this was good. it is chicken. season to your own taste. DUH!!!!! Why are not intelligent people even trying to cook. the recipe ingredients tell you how much chicken and step 3 tells you when to put on the cheese. Do you people need help crossing the street?
Baked Mushroom Chicken#1#0#Made with sherry instead of broth and left out the mozzarella because I didn't have any - family loved it. Will try doubling the mushrooms and sauce next time. Delicious. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#DELICIOUS!!! Made tonite for dinner and my Husband and I really enjoyed the chicken!! I added some koser salt, ground pepper and garlic powder to the flour before dredging the chicken. Will definitely make again for the whole family for our Sunday get togethers.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#AWESOME!!! This recipe is definitely a must for keeping. I did add more mushrooms and I salted, peppered, and added garlic to the chicken breast before flouring. This would also be great for dinner guests. Thanks SO mush for sharing!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#It SAYS in the top line of the Ingredients that you need, and I quote 4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves (1 pound) for this recipe. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#For Barry! Here's the answer to your question......4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves (1 pound). Read the next time!! Thank you!!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Recipe ingredient list does not include amount of chicken. How many breasts?
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#2#When do you put in the green onions and the cheese you have listed in your ingredients? They are not in your Directions.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Awesome!! I have made this a couple of times... I use WAY more mushrooms and chicken broth so I have lots to add to each chicken. I also add garlic and use shredded parmesan - THIS is SOOOO good!!!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I liked this recipe. Used boneless chicken thighs and yellow onions. I sauteed the onions before I browned the chicken. I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I thought it was absolutely delicious. I did make one change. So I wouldn't have to pound the chicken, I used boneless skinless thighs. Everything else I followed to the letter. Will definitely make again.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#2#1#I haven't made this dish yet but just needed to speak my peace. When I read reviews I look for whether it was good, bad or just so so. When people start saying they made it but they added this or deleted that then I kind of just skip over that recipe. Maybe if you have to make a lot of changes you could just enter a new recipe? 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Made this the other night and it was delicious! I had a bit of Chardonnay that I added in. My husband liked it and the chicken was very moist. You really don't need any added salt because of the cheeses. Great recipe!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This chicken is a hit with my family and for anyone I prepare it for. It is so very good.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#1#0#*I made this last night for our girls' game night dinner and everyone loved it! Doubled the mushrooms and butter they were sauted in and used 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup sherry for more sauce on the chicken. Served it with steamed broccoli and rice. Excellent! I will definitely make this again! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#1#I added a small halved and sliced Vidalia onion to the mushroom saute. I used the entire container of sliced Baby Bella mushrooms, maybe 2 cups. Rather than dirty an 11 x 17 pan I added the chicken breast back to my heavy saute pan, spooned the lovely mushroom and onion sauce over and baked. Moist and perfectly done at 15 minutes. Oops, I forgot to add the grated cheese but didnt miss it..
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Excellent, fast and easy! Used extra mushrooms and instead of pounding chicken, just sliced into two thin breasts. Very flavorful and moist. Keeper!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Sounds delicious
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I've made this several times. Delicious and like the idea of dry sherry instead of broth...will definitely try that next time. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Omit the salt and use low or no sodium broth. Plenty of salt in the cheese. Your ankles will thank you.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Original recipe was with Sherry not broth. Amazing!! Everyone loved made lots! Did add extra mushrooms
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Last night was the first time making this dinner' It was fast due to the light browning on both sides of the chicken which comes out juicy after it's baked. It's easy since I prepared this before hand letting it sit in the broth until my family all arrived. Then 20 mins later at 350 degrees I removed it to add the 2 toppings along with spinach for iron then cooked it 5 more minutes and it was absolutely delicious! Even the kids loved this!Thank you Barbara for sharing ur great tasting recipe! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Makes a beautiful presentation over noodles.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Quick, easy and delicious just as recipe is written. Fresh mushrooms and scallions are a must!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I have been making this recipe for many years making no changes, just adding more mushrooms. Always excellent!!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#We really loved this recipe. Easy and delicious.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Super Delicious, the whole family loves this. I tripled the recipe and still no leftovers. Definitely a keeper
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#everyone really liked this one it is a keeper.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Loved it! I included the green onions when reducing the broth.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I've made this many times.. it's the best.Easy and delicious. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Delicious !!! - just follow the recipe
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Great recipe! Have made this a few times. Added garlic per reviews and a whole package of mushrooms as they make a great side dish.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#1#0#Could not make it as your Kraft Add covered the directions
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Loved it. I will definitely try some of the suggestions in the below comments for doubling the sauce and adding a little garlic or lemon juice.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This one's a keeper! I doubled everything, well ok, I probably tripled the cheese, didn't flatten the chicken, just baked it an extra 6 minutes. Lots of flavour, tender and juicy. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Easy peasy and delicious! Used boneless skinless thighs.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Great flavour, you need to double or triple the sauce. I've made it twice once with chicken breasts and then with boneless skinless chicken thighs. I added granulated garlic to the flour and doubled the amount of mushrooms. Everyone loved it. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Really enjoyed this dish! I didn't pound the breasts, just cooked them as is, but the sauce definitely needs to be increased, there was not enough. Next time I'll at least double it. But the flavor of this dish was so good, yum! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Very good! I added two tablespoons of lemon juice to the sauce.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Made this for dinner very good. Took to work the next day for lunch. still just as good as the first night.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This is very easy to make and very tasty. I added a bit of garlic powder and fresh chives instead of green onions because I did not have the onions on hand. This would be nice for a dinner party. Think I will try it on some friends.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#1#0#This was super easy and really delicious. I didn't have fresh mushrooms so I used two small cans. I wasn't sure about that because we love fresh mushrooms, but when they were sauteed in butter and added to the recipe, they were great. My husband asked me to add more cheese and more green onion the next time. When we heated it for leftovers I would add a handful of shredded cheese on the chicken. I'll also try chicken tenderloins, as I almost always have them on hand. Just have to watch the cooking time. Fabulous! Good enough for a company dinner. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Easy recipe to follow and memorize. Thank you for the awesome recipe. This is now one of my favorites!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Followed recipe exactly & is delicious.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I looked at the recipe and thought it would be good. It looked so easy. It was VERY easy and VERY good. I would serve this at a wedding or wedding like event. It was great as leftovers as well. I added onion, parsley, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the chicken in the frying pan. I didn't fry it as long and let it bake in the oven longer. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was VERY tasty! Loved how easy it was, too! I doubled the ingredients for the sauce; served chicken and sauce over rice. I will definitely make this recipe again and again!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#So yummy! My husband loved it and he is not even a fan of mushrooms! Will definitely make again!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Excellent! Can't wait to make again. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I've made this a few times now, and it's fabulous. Everyone that's eaten it has wanted the recipe. It's a keeper. I've noted that the size the breasts are flattened to is not as important as simply keeping them uniform so that they cook evenly. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Wonderful dish, a local restaurant has a similar dish, but this is much better. I tend to always pound the chicken breasts as they cook evenly and are so tender.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Great dish, very easy and full of flavor. Used thin breast and did not flatten them.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Wow! This is really good! It smells amazing while it is baking and my kids just loved it. Even better as leftovers - I put it in my daughter's thermos and sent it to lunch with her the next day - 100% GONE! This is certainly a keeper. No changes to recipe necessary. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I didn't pound the chicken but let the breasts cook until their temperature was about 160 degrees. Very good recipe. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I must admit that I was very skeptical about the ingredients. It sounded a little bland but I was wrong. This was very tasty. I would only make enough to eat right away because the leftovers didn't taste as good. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Love this recipe! Serve it with with rice and you've got a great weekend meal and leftovers to look forward to the next night. Definitely in my rotation now! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#VERY good
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#My family loved it and it was so juicy and flavorful.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Wonderful
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Just made this tonight, and my husband and I both thought it was so good! I added some garlic powder and ground pepper to the chicken while sauteing for some extra flavor, and left off the green onions. Very tender and flavorful - great for a week night meal but would also be nice for guests. Definitely a keeper!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Delicious and very easy to make. I served it with instant brown rice (takes only 10 minutes to make) and fresh mini bell peppers. I liked it so much that I had it for dinner last night, and then for lunch and dinner today!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This is unbelievable. I used sliced baby portabella mushrooms I added some leftover white wine it was really elegant.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Great go to recipe, quick and east and very easy with a good blending of mushroom sauce and cheeses. I simply use thin chicken breasts and that makes it even quicker.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I would like to serve this with fresh pasta. Would I need sauce for the pasta or just olive oil and pepper. Any suggestions?
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#5 star recipe. Want to make it 6 stars? Sprinkle with crisp fried crumbled bacon before serving.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was so easy, and so tender. This is part of our normal rotation now. By the way, this is also great without the cheese for your picky eaters, just add it after.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was delicious! Made it with chicken tenders but otherwise didn't change a thing. Really easy dish that is sure to be a crowd pleaser. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I LOVE this recipe. It's great for a quick weeknight meal, but even better for company. It tastes and looks like it's a lot of work, but so simple. It's a go-to dish when I have guests over.TIP: This is also very easy to serve to someone who can't have dairy. It's still delicious if you keep the cheeses separate and sprinkle it on after dishing it up. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I tried this recipe tonight and it was delicious...thank you...I wish I knew how to add a picture....
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Easy, quick, and tasty chicken dish... very tende rand love the cheeses in this recipe. I plan to make this again soon.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Excellent dish! Wonderful flavor! I couldn't believe that I made it. Just the right amount of everything! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Outstanding! One of the best chicken dishes I've ever found too. Slight modifications I made include the use of chicken tenders, and onion powder and garlic powder added to the mushrooms (I didn't have any green onions). To echo previous comment, this is a new favorite! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This is excellent , I did add garlic as we love it and it was great, a new favorite!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I was looking for a recipe to use ingredients that I had left over, so I used onion powder instead of green onions and a sprinkling of extra-sharp cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. My family was totally over the moon for this dish. Superb!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Ths is one of the best chicken recipes I've ever found. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#WOW is all I can say! This is so yummy! I think the only thing I would do differently is eliminate the salt and add a little garlic. It was perfect with an entire 8oz container of mushrooms with some rice pilaf on the side. Anything more would have been too much food. Definitely making this again soon.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Very good! I think next time I wont add the extra salt. I think with the chicken broth, it added enough salt. It was very tasty and moist, will definitely make again!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#These are very similar to Paula Deen's Chicken Georgia recipe. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This has been a family favorite in our house for years! I admit, I always use more cheese than it calls for, probably 1 c. and I use the whole 8 oz package of mushrooms.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#So good! If you love mushrooms, you have to try this recipe!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was easy and tasty. I would add garlic to the mushroom saute next time and double the recipe - I bet it'd be great as leftovers. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This recipe was excellent! It was easy to make, too. My husband even gave it 5 stars and he doesn't give many recipes that high a rating. It would make a great dish for company. Served it with brown rice, Lemon Butter Green Beans and Strawberry Spinach Salad. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#T his was so yummy and easy! We will definetely make again.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#great tasting, easy to make,
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This may be the best chicken recipe that I have ever made. It is outstanding and can't wait to have the leftovers. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#My kids said the word amazing countless times tonight. It was a big hit! In addition to being family friendly, it's party worthy. A definite keeper! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This chicken turned out very flavorful and moist. I left out the mushrooms and added onions and Italian herbs, as I did not have any mushrooms. It is a great gourmet-style recipe that is not too complicated! I would definitely make this again!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I don't use the cheese. We love this dish. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#me and my husband really liked it. I didn't have any green onions but it turned out really well. I used about a cup of broth to start out with and it boiled down good. I loved the cheese on top and probably put more than called for! The mushrooms were fantastic! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#One of my favorite company dishes... especially when it isn't grilling season. So moist and flavorful - I always receive rave reviews. delicious with the Herbed Angel Hair Pasta. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I have made this recipe numerous times since the first time I served it to my family. It is excellent. We add additional mushrooms since we love them.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This is just the best chicken recipe. We love it.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This is the most amazing tender chicken ever, my whole family loves this and when my son comes home from college he always asks me to make this. Along with the mushrooms I will often add green peppers and onions. Turns out everytime!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was so easy to make and so delicious!! I added the whole package of mushrooms instead of just one cup, and I did 1/4 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup white wine... I HIGHLY recommend this!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#great recipe!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was delicious, I was feeling creative so I made some modifications. I added a few splashes of white wine for flavour, sautéed some garlic and onion in with the mushrooms . I also added some season salt to the flour mix. Served with asparagus and dill cream sauce...YUMMY!My boyfriend gave it a 9/10 and said that I need to remember this one 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Really enjoyed this recipe. It was delicious and simple. The only thing I did differently was saute the green onions with the mushrooms. I served it with garlic egg noodles and broccoli. Even my 8 yr. old and 5 yr. old liked it. They cleaned their plates!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Always looking for good, relatively easy to prepare, and able bake ahead if needed chicken recipes; this one is a keeper! We doubled the cheese, scallions, and sauce quantities.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Tender and flavorful describes this dish. The family goes wild over it. It's simple and great tasting. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I made this and it was very good, but I'mm confused that you start out with 1/2 cup broth and it says to reduce it to 1/2 cup. It ended up reducing to almost nothing (because I didn't realize it would go so fast) so I added another 1/2 cup broth to pour over the chicken. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#WOW! Everyone loved it! I didn't have mozzarella cheese or green onions and it was still wonderful! Next time I'll try to have both. We ate 2 hours ago and I can still taste it. Definately will make this one again!! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This chicken was absolutely delicious. I'm on the look-out for low carbohydrate recipes as my boyfriend is watching his carbs, and this filled the bill nicely. I could make it even more low-carb by just browning the breasts without the flour. The list of ingredients was simple, and I wasn't expecting it to taste as wonderful as it did. Great recipe! Everyone loved it. 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#AWESOME flavor! I did not pound out the chicken breasts; I cut them thinner as in tenders and I added extra green onions. YUM! Looks as awesome as it tastes!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#A meal rarely gets rated as excellent by everyone; very good yes, but not very often an excellent. This one recipe received an excellent rating from all 4 family members.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#My kids loved it. Especially my oldest daughter.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I can't get over how delicious this dish was!!!!! It is by far, one of my favorites!! Thanks for sharing! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was SOOO good! Everything was so moist and delicious! I made it for the first time 2 nights ago...and my fiance requested that I make it again the very next night! This is deff. one of the best recipe's I have ever cooked! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#I loved it and my guest did also! I cut it in half for two people. I pounded then instead of putting flour on it I sprinkled it with McCormicks Perfect Pinch Garlic & Herb salt free. Then put it in an 8 x 8 pan with the mushrooms and onions on it and baked it, covered. Then uncovered it and put the cheese on it.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was phenomenal and so easy! I used chicken cutlets instead of pounding out chicken breasts (had about 7 cutlets), and I added some diced green bell pepper and minced garlic to the broth and mushrooms. It was totally amazing! I agree, no need for the extra salt, the parmesan gives plenty of flavor. Will be adding this to my faves!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Great. My husband loved it and we will be making it again.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#i loved it!!!!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This is the best chicken ever. Sometimes I add green peppers too.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Delicious, but definitely does NOT need any added salt!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#As far as I'm concerned, this is the perfect recipe for a working mom. Very quick and easy and it's delicious. Very easy to make on those busy weekdays but also good for a nice relaxing dinner! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This is delicious and very easy to make. The ingredients are healthy and my wife loved it!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Everyone I serve this too loves it! It is wonderful and easy!
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#My favorite! I made it for my dad, he said, That is the best chicken I've ever had. Score! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#This was very good and simple to make. I will make it again for my family. Whole family liked it.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Hubby and I LOVED this recipe! The flavors were really outstanding! To make it a little healthier, I substituted wheat flour for the all-purpose and used part-skim mozzarella.
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Such a delicious recipe! 
Baked Mushroom Chicken#0#0#Chicken is tender and very good. One of my favorites. My Mom makes this often and I asked her for the recipe. Now I can make it also. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I bet a few tsp of almond extract would be really nice too.
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#Can you use whole milk?
Hot Milk Cake#13#0#My grandmother made this and when it came out of the oven she would spread some butter on it then sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on it.
Hot Milk Cake#6#5#Tried this recipe today and loved it does anyone know if it also works for cupcakes? If so, approximately how many does it make?
Hot Milk Cake#10#0#My husband loves this recipe! The only thing I find is I have to bake much longer than the 35 minutes, sometimes an extra 20 minutes.
Hot Milk Cake#7#0#My mom gave this recipe to me years ago, and it was perfect for strawberry shortcake. It transported well and held up well with the addition of the strawberry sauce. Easy to make, and everyone enjoyed it.
Hot Milk Cake#22#3#Wonderfully flavored cake. I followed the advice of one reviewer by adding the vanilla after I added the hot milk and butter. I baked it for 35 minutes and dusted the top with powdered sugar.
Hot Milk Cake#11#4#I followed the recipe as it, but the cake came out dense. I was expecting a lighter, fluffier cake. The flavor of the cake was good, but the texture was not what I was expecting. I was expecting a lighter, more spongier cake.
Hot Milk Cake#41#2#This is very similar to the recipe I grew up with. We waited until the butter and hot milk were added to the batter before putting in the vanilla---vanilla loses some of its' flavor under direct heat like hot milk, so you'll get a better vanilla flavor if you add it at the end. 
Hot Milk Cake#16#6#An excellent recipe. I like to try new recipes when I have just a cup or so of whole milk remaining, just to see what I can accomplish. I'm rarely disappointed, and a search today led me to this one - which I will keep. It is amazing. Will top some pieces with some raspberries that I froze at the end of the season last year (the canes are already getting ready to produce a new crop) and we will enjoy it this evening. Thank you. 
Hot Milk Cake#17#5#So good!!! You can probably get away with putting less sugar in it if you wanted, but how much less I don't know! I had to bake it about 10 mins longer than stated, but my dad said it's the best white cake he's ever had! Yes I know it's not white cake but it's similar!!!!
Hot Milk Cake#10#0#Seriously easy, super tasty, and the perfect way to use up close-to-date milk. I've used whole and 2% with perfect success. Our kids are wild about this cake...especially when paired with a warm caramel sauce. This one is a keeper!
Hot Milk Cake#5#2#does it has to be done 2% milk? can it be whole?
Hot Milk Cake#39#4#can you make this in a bundt or tube pan? i want to make this tomorrow so if anyone knows please respond asap- thank you!!
Hot Milk Cake#7#2#Hi, ilI wanted to try this cake, just wanted to ask the cup size what is it in grams? And also I have a gas cooker so what will be the gas mark for baking it?
Hot Milk Cake#1#1#This is a great cake for strawberry shortcake. We usually prefer biscuits but this cake is a nice change. I reduce the sugar just a bit (1/8 cup less) as it's a bit sweet. I also add a pinch of salt. I bake in a 9 inch pan for 25 minutes (check with a toothpick 5 minutes before the directions state - you don't want a dry cake). When I sugar my strawberries, I keep them a bit tart to offset the sweetness of the cake. This is a little bit fussy but it really is a delicious cake! 
Hot Milk Cake#10#0#Not sure what all the negative comments are about. I baked this with very little skill and it turned out absolutely perfect! the cake was so soft and wonderful. the only thing I did was reduce the sugar to 1 and 1/4 cup because i frosted the cake. Please do bake this cake :) its such a great ,simple and delicious one
Hot Milk Cake#9#3#I have used this recipe many times for layer cakes for my kids' birthdays. I have added a pinch of salt a few times, other times I have poked holes with a chopstick and poured in jello, and I have at times dumped a bunch of cocoa powder in with the dry ingredients. They have all turned out great! I like this cake because it is structurally sound and can withstand icing like a champ. Use a long bread knife to slice off the slight dome. When I use buttercream I do a thin crumb coat, stick it in the fridge, wash a couple of dishes and then the do the real icing. Beautiful every time!
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I realized I never reviewed this recipe and what an oversight that was! This cake is amazing! So easy too!
Hot Milk Cake#6#1#Delicious and different as I was not prepared for the sponge-like texture. Served with lemon curd and whipped cream. As with most cake recipes I come across and don't see salt, I added about 1/3 tsp plus used one (1) Tbsp high quality vanilla. After greasing glass cake pan, I sprinkled it with sugar before adding batter. And, for me cake took longer to bake than 30 minutes while increased baking time gradually. This cake could definitely be substituted for the biscuits in shortcake. Yum! 
Hot Milk Cake#3#3#I made this once and it turned out amazing. I have a terrible oven so I set it to 300 and it took longer but worked out. I topped mine with strawberry Jam. Has anyone tried making this into a cupcake?
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#I have made this cake multiple times and my family loves it. I topped it with strawberries and some whip cream and it is an instant success.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Healthy Recipe..Thank you.
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#This is an excellent cake. Very tasty, goes really well with Strawberries
Hot Milk Cake#3#0#What a delicious cake! I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9 inch round cake pan. I baked it 25 mins. Probably could have used another couple of minutes. And I should have used butter and flour in the pan instead of spray (it did stick). But my son and I were instantly addicted! My only changes were using whole milk (all I had) and adding a pinch of salt (and btw...I also used regular salted butter too). This came together so quickly! And it is perfect eaten warm!
Hot Milk Cake#6#2#I made this cake for the first time many years ago when my children still lived at home. I took it out of the oven and my husband and I had a piece and loved it. Then our son and his friend and our daughter came home from high school. They tried it and loved it. Then a friend stopped by to drop something off. She tried it and loved it as well. I'm so glad I still have the recipe 
Hot Milk Cake#3#0#Delicious. And yes, I beat the eggs for 5 full minutes!
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#Halved the recipe and made it to accompany strawberries and and whipped cream. It was excellent! Not too sweet and nice and moist. Will definitely use this one again and again.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Love it! So easy and delicious
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I followed the recipe exactly as written and the cake turned out beautifully. It was light and tasty. It's not a strong flavored cake, but a great light snack or a wonderful dessert with some fruit added to it. My husband said that in the words of the Great British Baking Show, it's a beautiful sponge ! I will definitely make this cake again. Sometimes I'll make it as is and sometimes I'll play around and add flavors to it or a topping of some kind. This is a great cake recipe. 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#Really good tasting cake but set your timer for 25 minutes for testing if finished. Ours baked for 30, stuck to the pan and candies on the perimeter. I'm going to try this one again because it's delish!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Very yummy! A nice combination of moist and light. I wish I had fresh strawberries, because they would have complimented this perfectly. I will definitely make this again for a quick, easy, simple and delicious dessert.
Hot Milk Cake#5#0#I remember my mama making this cake. It is basic and tasty, more of a pound cake than a fluffy cake and really good for snacking. She would sometimes frost with buttercream and sprinkle heavily with chopped peanuts. Sure does bring back memories. 
Hot Milk Cake#19#3#If you follow this recipe, you'll get a cake that's pretty dense. The recipe has the right ingredients but the wrong steps for a fluffy cake. Only use a mixer to beat the eggs and sugar. After that, use a spatula to mix everything else in, because if you continue to use a mixer you'll beat out a lot of air bubbles from the mixture, which will make it less fluffy. Also add the milk and butter before the flour, because adding the flour first will make the mixture so dense that it will push out the air from the mixture. If you prefer something less sweet, use 1.25 cups of sugar instead of 2. You could also melt the butter first, before stirring in the milk, just to make it melt faster. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Fabulous! I didn't change a thing! I put whipped topping and fresh strawberries on top. My husband LOVED it! Thank you! 
Hot Milk Cake#4#0#Well I made the recipe tonight. Nice basic ingredients that I already had, and a simple recipe. Wanted to start a little tradition with my young daughters that they could pass on making a simple cake from scratch. While it was a little sweet for my own taste, they absolutely loved it. The texture was spongy and moist, and the plain cake was a hit solo. I also made a berry compote to add a bit of tartness for my own preference (and my mom's) and the girls loved that too. I guess the key is in proper mixing. Not a fake review! There were a couple negative reviews from so-called baking professionals that said the cake turned out awful or that the positive reviews were not genuine. Real mom here.
Hot Milk Cake#6#0#This cake came out exactly as I expected it would. The negative reviews , I imagine, come from negative haters. Some people are only happy when ripping others down. My suggestion is to learn how to bake before you comment. Delicious cake and I'm looking forward to some truffle tonight!
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#Just made it but didn't follow the instructions due to habit I mixed all dry ingredients before I realized that wasn't the way, but I added them slowly to the batter and it came out perfectly and is delicious ??
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I followed the recipe exactly as stated but I did add more vanilla, and it was delicious, will definitely make again, I served mine with fresh berries and whip cream.
Hot Milk Cake#10#0#I am 81 an have been baking this cake since I was 12. I have never had it to fail...ever!! About 40 years ago, I started adding a broiled topping and serving with whipped cream. It is delicious and loved at the church and quilt potlucks. Here is broiled topping: 1-1/2 C packed brown sugar,3/4 C butter, 1/2 C half and half. Bring to a boil and stir until sugar is dissolved. Remove and add 2 C coconut and 1/2 C chopped nuts. Broil until bubbly and lightly browned. Make this in the morning so that the topping flavors can meld into the cake.
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#After reading the reviews I changed this around. I added a T of vanilla bean paste plus the t of vanilla. I used half and half instead of 2%. I beat the eggs a long time until they were light and fluffy and then added the sugar and beat again until light and fluffy for quite a bit. My batter was smooth and creamy. I baked this in a glass baking dish so I reduced my oven temp to 335. When it was done and cooled I made a fresh blueberry compote to serve on top with a dollop of homemade whipped cream but refrigerated whipped topping would work just as well. I liked it because it's a light dessert without heavy frosting to hold it down. Perfect for a light spring or summer supper.
Hot Milk Cake#7#0#I'am 79. We had this cake all the time when I was little. Don' to know where my mother got this. I still make this now and my kids and grandkids love it. The only differents I use 2cups flour, 2teaspoon baking soda, 1teaspoon salt mix together, 2 cups sugar and 2 eggs mix this together, 1 cup milk 1tablespoon crisco shortening, melt crisco in milk. Alternate flour mixture and milk. Do not beat, mix well. 375 oven, 25mins. Test at 20 mins. Test with toothpick. Now we only made a layer cake. Always this chocolate frosting. 4 Tablespoon butter, 4 ounces unsweetened Hershey's chocolate, melt together. 3cups sifted confectioners sugar, 1teaspoon vanilla, 1/8 teaspoon salt. 1/3 cup warm milk. Add not all milk at once to sugar and chocolate mix now add rest of milk. Frost cake, serve warm. My mom always put 4 toothpicks to hold cake together, who ever gat a toothpick got another piece of cake. This tradition still goes own. ENJOY! Sandra
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#I cannot understand how anyone can have a failure with this recipe. I've been using it for a number of years and it always turns out as shown. In fact, I made it a few days ago and have given the recipe to two friends because they liked it so well. 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I love this cake. It's the perfect base for strawberry shortcake, or for a topping of any fruit with whipped cream. Leftovers are great with a cup of coffee in the morning. I don't understand those who had trouble, but cakes are one of those things that you have to follow instructions carefully. 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I'm not sure what the others did wrong, but this is an awesome recipe! 
Hot Milk Cake#3#0#Damien, you made my day! Your statement that some of these folks just can't cook or bake. I am surprised and disappointed at the venom some of these posters spray. Everyone likes different tastes. I don't understand the hatefulness expressed. I guess since people can't be identified they feel they can say such hateful things about someone's recipe. If you do care for a recipe, you don't care for it. Plain and simple. Move on and try another recipe.
Hot Milk Cake#3#1#Easy recipe. Great when fresh strawberries are available, ( or peaches or cherries) Scrape bowl often when adding flour or milk mixture. Added 1 teaspoon of grated lemon rind with vanilla, nice flavor. Sister likes it with grated orange rind. Use non-stick foil in pan. Grab foil and place on cutting board when done. No need to clean a pan.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#My mom has the same recipe but we put chocolate whip cream frosting on it. We make it for birthday dinners.
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I am anxious to try this recipe. The one I have made for years and years calls for 2 cups flour, 1 cup milk and 1 stick of butter. Always use butter and flour to grease the pan, never a cooking spray as the cake will not rise properly. Maybe this is the problem for some of the bakers.
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#Made this cake today, was pretty simple to make, served it as a strawberry shortcake, I think the cake would also be wonderful to use in a trifle. I will save it and make it again.
Hot Milk Cake#0#6#Disgusting. Didn't set properly and had to throw it away. Waste of Ingredients. I ignored the bad reviews and thought I could make it work, but it turned out rubbish! Definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND. Use another recipe
Hot Milk Cake#4#0#It came out exactly as described. The negative comments, I'd hazard to guess... just can't cook. That said, I didn't particularly like it, but what do you really expect to get from a Hot Milk Cake FFS? 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#This is a humble cake. And, it is delicious. I have made it numerous times and it comes out perfectly every time. I don't understand how it doesn't come out for others. I make a could of small tweaks. I use unsalted butter for all of my baking, so I added a teaspoon of salt and whisked it together with the flour, baking power and salt before adding them to the batter. I used twice the vanilla. Also, I think it makes a big difference if you add ingredients very gradually. Make sure an addition of flour is almost completely incorporated before adding the next. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#11#VERY BAD EXPERIENCE. DO NOT TRY. the batter was so lumpy even though i used everything stated above with exact quantity. then when i baked it, it didn't even rise properly and tasted gross. i've been making hot milk cake with a different recipe but i wanted to try a new recipe and now regretting my decision.
Hot Milk Cake#0#9#Ok it looks white and tastes good but I don't like the inside at all I hate it nasty nasty white cake ever 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#Perfect recipe, just follow the procedure and yoi will get a fluffy tasty cake, kids so loved it....
Hot Milk Cake#3#0#currently on quarantine lockdown and tired of looking at the same walls. went to my cupboards and found i had all ingredients on hand. i accidentally added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and combined all the dry ingredients out of habit. turned out wonderful! adding this to regular rotation.
Hot Milk Cake#0#9#Absolutely horrible cake recipe! I've been baking for a long time and this has to be the worst cake recipe I've ever tried. A total waste of ingredients. I followed the recipe to a T, didn't over mix/ over fold and it had the worst texture! Very dense and almost gummy feeling. I wish I could give this 0 stars. This is the first time I've been truly disappointed by a recipe on this site. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This came out beautiful and fluffy and moist and delicious. I am not a professional baker just a hobby from home and had no problems with the recipe and directions. I will have to make this over and over again.
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#This is a real review. :-) I've been making this exact recipe for many, many years. At one time, I would bake two to feed my family of seven; however, with just me and my husband now, I cut the recipe in half and use a 9x9 pan. This is my definite go-to recipe for (many) strawberry shortcake every summer....but love just as much plain, out of the oven, with powdered sugar sprinkled on top. Chances are you have every ingredient at home and can whip this up in no time. Why look for another recipe when you've got the best, right here!! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#6#Disappointing. This recipe calls more liquid than most of other hot milk cake recipes. Because of numerous good reviews, I didn't doubt to try it. I baked twice, followed the exact method, exact scale of ingredients, but both didn't turn out well. (Note that I didn't overwhip the eggs or overfold. I went to a baking academy, and I've been baking for more than 5 years.) If you're looking for fluffy hot milk cake, definitely do not try this recipe. If you're up to really dense, dense, cake, maybe you could try this recipe. Maybe this is why you shouldn't take recipes from the internet, I highly doubt these good reviews are real as the youtube views for this recipe is considered low. I won't be making these again. I'll try to find other hot milk cake recipes. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#good, amazing and fun
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#This cake was a bit too sweet on its own for me, Maybe I didn't incorporate the sugar enough, will definitely try again though as it's a great tasting cake. With this sweet batch I ended up layering it with thickened cream and coffee and made a tiramisu it was delicious!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#So gorgeous.....
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Delicious!!!!!
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#Loved it. 2nd time I varied the recipe a little: more vanilla and 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk, beat the whites, replaced the white volume with water to make the batter, folded in the whites. It's just as delicious, but substantially lighter with out losing the creamy ness.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I live in Colorado at high altitude
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#My cake didn't rise. Isn't baking soda needed for helping to rise? I didn't see that in the receipe 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#good &lt;a href= https://scoopkeeda.com/video-banane-wala-apps-download/ target= _blank &gt;information&lt;/a&gt; I need deep recipe about this 
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#This is an excellent cake. Made it just as recipe instructed. You need to have oven preheated when making this cake. It needs to go into the oven as quickly as possible, while the batter is still warm. I think it rises better that way.
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#Quick and easy to make. I used chai instead of milk to turn it into a chai cake. I added some spices with the dry ingredients too. It's a bit sweet, so I paired it with a less sweet icing. I think cream cheese icing or icing made of instant pudding mix and thickened cream would be nice. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This cake is so easy to make! It's top off a meal nicely. Old-fashioned goodness!! 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#My mother made this when I was growing up in the'30s &'40s; her recipe is almost exactly the same as this one. She filled the layers and topped the cake with what I know now was a thick lemon curd. Delicious! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This recipe has become a family favorite. I'm making it today for my daughter's 22nd birthday. When I told her, she was overjoyed! This cake is absolutely delicious. No frosting at all. It's so quick to make that I can throw it into the oven after dinner, and have a delicious dessert in no time. I don't let it cool too much, because we think it tastes best when it is hot. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Made this cake. It was great. Topped it with brown sugar frosting. Everyone loves it. Everyone must try brown sugar frosting. Just cut the powdered sugar in half and it has the perfect amount of sweetness.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Wow! I was very impressed with the texture and taste of this cake. It was great served with fresh fruit and next time I may serve it with lemon curd. Sooo easy !!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I just tried it and it is amazing, however I used self-raising flour and baking powder and it came soft like a chiffon cake. Simply amazing
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I have made this cake for years as my base for Trifle. I split the cake in half and place in bottom of glass bowl, sprinkle with a liqueur that matches my fruit, cover with jam or cooked fruit, add pudding and repeat layers then cover with sweetened whipped cream. It always disappears quickly.
Hot Milk Cake#1#1#Very disappointed with this recipe. I bake a lot and this recipe looked very interesting, but not what I expected, it was very dense, I was expecting it to be much lighter. I followed the recipe exactly. If you want light and fluffy and moist, this is not the cake for you.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This cake brings bake so many sweet childhood memories when my family was so close. My aunt France's use to make got milk cake 27th walnuts inside and chocolate icing...that was my favorite part of the holidays...I. Still make them...cooking one tidat!!! 
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#The first time that I made this cake, I used all purpose flour and all I could taste was the flour. The cake was dense even though it rose beautifully. The second time that I made this cake, I used Swans Down Cake Flour and it made a huge difference in the flavor and the texture! I also used this recipe to make 36 cupcakes. I baked them at 325 degrees for exactly 20 minutes and they came out perfect! This is going to be my go to recipe every time I make a cake or cupcakes! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I just made my moms recipe for hot milk cake and decided to search for variations. I was reading the reviews and I just wanted to take the time to say please do not follow the advice given by Jacksjojo. I wish there was a way to report it. You cannot can anything with eggs, milk, or flour. Even if you could these directions are not an appropriate way of canning. Just because the lid seals does not mean that is safe. You could potentially die of botulism or worse kill someone else when you give it as a gift.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Love homemade milk cake!
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I have been making this cake for over 25 years ... it is one of my husband's favorites ... I do use salted Butter ... if you don't have salted butter just add 1/2 tsp salt ... and I use 1 TBS of Vanilla. The mixture is thin! BUT it works perfectly. I usually make it in a Bundt Pan , just because we like it that way. Too thin for a Tube Pan ... I like to make this to add to Gift Baskets. Use 6 to 7 PINT size wide mouth jars, Grease inside, fill about 2/3 full place on a pan to bake @ 350 about 18 mins. or until touch test works. Place lids and rings on as soon as you can after removing from the oven, they will seal ... tighten after jars have cooled ... if sealed they will be GOOD for at 2-3 months in cabinet. Enjoy!I have tried to give this 5 Stars ... But it just won't let me ... Could be me! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#My grandmother made a cake very similar to this which she topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. When I saw fresh strawberries on special yesterday at the grocery store, I thought of her cake and found this recipe. The taste and smell were so familiar! The recipe was easy to make and tasted great. I also served some of the cake topped with chocolate icing and it was fantastic too. This recipe will become a permanent addition to my recipe collection! It's very versatile and oh so easy and tasty. 
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#I poked holes n the top of the cake and poured some cream of coconut over the top... oh so moist! I did a change tho' - I didn't put 2 cups of sugar in it (i is a diabetic) - I used 1 cup of sugar - had rave reviews from every1! loved it... 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Delicious! Easy too. I would like to hear about some different frosting ideas for it. I did like it plain and also with a little powdered sugar. I'm just curious. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I got the credit of making a tasty cake
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is the perfect cake to top with your favorite fruit topping. I take it to almost every summer time picnic and it never fails to disappear.
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#I am 71 and this was my favorite cake growing up. This was the base for our strawberry shortcake. My mother also made it with a maple fudge frosting which I loved. When I started to make it at age 10, my mother couldn't understand why mine always tasted better than hers. We found out why, years later, when I discovered that I had mis-read her recipe and was adding twice the butter! To this day, I still mis-read her recipe.....yummmmm. 
Hot Milk Cake#3#0#My mom had made this cake for many, many years, it was one of her recipes, that relatives new she would bring to a shower, or to a special family gathering. She made a hot brown sugar sauce for the topping on the cake. for an after Sunday dinner desert, or sometimes with boiled frosting ..... We were always wondering, when she made it , was this cake for us, or was it leaving the house.....comfort food from our childhood I guess.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Simple and delicious! Simply delicious! Definitely a keeper, I followed this recipe to the T and it is fabulous. We will enjoy this for many years to come.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Great Cake, works every time, now make it as muffins as everyone wants more, makes 24 so enough for everyone
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#This is an excellent cake for a pineapple or peach upside own cake. Not too heavy, and it makes enough batter for two cakes. Or make the second cake into something else, like Boston Cream Cake.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Nice
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#My family loved it. I wasn't sure it would turn out but it was delicious. I served it with chocolate ice cream. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Do you use salted or unsalted butter? Also, someone mentioned that it's better with salt, but I don't see salt listed in the ingredients. Do you add salt? Thanks 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is d Best Cake Ever..love D Recipe..
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#We have been making hot milk cakes in our family for more than 75 years. It is an easy tasty cake and you can add coco powder 1\2 cup or more to taste and make a chocolate hot milk cake! Delicious!
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I followed the instruction exactly like it was written without adding any salt! The results were still great though I would agree to add a little salt next time! Could be as a base for any birthday cake with any thing/flavour added! Spongy and moist at the same time! I will make it again for sure!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#LOVE the recipe!!! Its a keeper! Will make often and don't see why some people don't like it. Crazy! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Very yummy and so easy! I only used 1 & 1/2 C sugar and added 2 tsp vanilla and a little salt. It has a great consistency. Thanks for sharing - this will be one of our favorites now!!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is pretty decent but the Magnolia Bakery's Vanilla Birthday Cake is very similar to this and I do like the texture better. I would make this again though, it is quick and easy to make. 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I thought this cake was really easy to make and came out great! The texture is both spongy and slightly dense at the same time. I followed other reviewers' suggestions to add a smidge more vanilla and a pinch of salt. I did also add about 1/2 tsp. of rum extract because I thought the batter tasted good, but needed a little... something! You could really use this cake as a base and add any type of extract or flavoring you're in the mood for. I also agree with the others who said it's very important to beat the eggs for the full 5 minutes, maybe even a little longer. I also made sure I beat the sugar and eggs until they were nice and airy too. 35 minutes in the oven was perfect. The cake tastes great on its own--especially when it's still warm--but I plan on serving it with strawberries and fresh whipped cream later. Can't wait! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#Great recipe but with the omissions I deleted 2 stars. For taste I would give it 4. I am an experienced baker and made this recipe as written except for the notes I made below.If someone were a novice baker this should be a simple enough recipe, but it will not turn out as expected unless you recognize and/or correct the following:Salt: Salt is necessary UNLESS you are using salted butter. Most people bake with unsalted butter since it allows the baker to control the salt in the recipe. This recipe may have been written for use with salted butter, but since it is not noted to use salted butter instead of the usual unsalted, it will come out bland without the addition of salt. I added 1/2 tsp and it came out perfect.Batter: My batter was unusually runny, I would even call it watery. I have made cakes with very runny batter previously, but I was unsure if this was one of those super moist types since the recipe didn't mention the consistency of the batter. I added 1/2 cup of ap flour just to be on the safe side and it came out very dense and moist without a lot of rise. Your results may vary, however. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is to DIE for!! I don't know what happened to the others that said this had no flavor as it is so sweet and delicious! Now I just need some strawberries! YUM! Thanks for the fantastic recipe. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Great recipe ....I made it tonight and the cake came out delicious
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Loved it! Very easy to make, light & fluffy!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Simple, old-fashioned, delicious cake. Would be great to use for strawberry shortcake as others have mentioned. Somewhat reminiscent of a GOOD Twinkie sponge. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is a great recipe,. Adding some lemon zest gives a nice light lemon taste. Top with berries and cream, or cinnamon and sugar. yummmm I love this cake. Very easy to make and flavor anyway you please.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#awesome
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This cake is delicious as a snack cake without frosting or topping because it is more dense than regular cake. We like to use this recipe for strawberry shortcake. It is so-o-o good!
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I never add baking soda or powder to my baked good because it makes it taste like soap so I didn't add it. It's similar to pound cake, very moist. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Did not like this one.
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#I was hoping that this recipe would be a real winner being that it got previous rave reviews, but I was very disappointed. This cake lacked in flavor and sweetness and was too dense. The only saving grace was the frosting, but then we decided that it still wasn't worth it so it went into the trash. Back to the drawing board! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#expellant recipe
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#u need to mix the eggs really good and the sugar we loved the cake
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I made this yesterday. If it wasn't for the chocolate frosting, I would of thrown it out. It is so heavy and not much flavor to it. We didn't like it. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I have been making this cake for over 30 years or more. It is my daughters favorite and always asked for it for her Birthday cake. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Grandma cake! Add cinnamon, or whatever spice you like. ......
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Super easy and super fun to make... YummyMy first cake... Enjoyed the experienceIt was just perfect!!!!
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#was easy and definitely yummy.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Perfect. I've used it for over 20 years 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This cake was so easy to make and very tasty. I only had skim milk and it turned out great. My girlfriend loves cake but doesn't like frosting so i was trying to find something tasty enough for me to enjoy and this was it. I think it would be good drizzled with maple syrup or corn syrup though and dusted with a little powder sugar if you wanted to dress it up. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This was a fun cake to make,very simply and very good. Didn't miss the frosting at all! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I tried this recipe today. It turned out good & was very Delish!!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#it tastes so good and so easy to make
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I can remember my Mom baking Hot Milk cake ..she would spread Karo syrup on top it was so delicious
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#i added a little of canolli dip in to it and its ,amazingly good
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#We love this cake. It has been our family birthday cake for as long as I can remember. Everyone loves it.I use Almond instead of Vanilla. Usually serve it plain, but sometimes dust it with powdered sugar.I've been making this cake since I was old enough to be in the kitchen. I'm well past retirement age now. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#very nice and fluffy. my family loved it. soft and spongy. I added 3 tablespoons of coco powder to theflour and it turned out really well. thanks for such sweet recipe.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#i tried this recipe and it came so good , perfect for my daughter, thanks for sharing... im planning to add more butter next time ill make this to have more butter taste :) and to add more vanilla and salt too same as the other did to their cake
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I tried this recipe and it turned out very nice and tasty.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Awesome!!! lovely texture, flavor and crumb!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#When you're raising 6 kids, you need lots of delicious, inexpensive recipes to fill up all those tummies! This recipe was one of our family's favorites when all the kids were growing up. So easy to top it with fruit to make it a little more special. But, everyone loved it just as it is! Easy to make & delicious! 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#literally just finished cooking it, definately came out light and fluffy, inlove with this cake already!! added blue food colouring to make it a little different and after reading some reviews, i ended up adding 1/4 salt and it came out perfect. Thanks to everyone for their reviews, it really made the cake work :)
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is a great cake, very moist and flavorful. It does need to cook longer than the directions say, at least in my oven. Don't rely on the toothpick test or it won't be cooked. It should spring back if you touch it, the top should be golden brown, and then it's done. I used boiled peanut butter frosting which was more like fudge. It was for a family birthday party and it disappeared fast. 
Hot Milk Cake#1#0#I tried this recipe and it came out really well. I was short of 1 egg but the outcome was still good. Thanks for sharing!!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I think what the reviews with low stars are missing is QUALITY ingredients. The first time I made this, I made no alterations and it was perfect. I topped with some homemade peach marmalade and that added just enough sweetness that coffee goes perfect with it. Now, I do use farm fresh eggs, fresh dairy milk and fresh dairy butter, so I'm thinking that that has something to do with it. With old recipes, it makes a huge difference. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Read the reviews and was a little nervous to make this. I added the 1/4 tsp of salt and I changed the vanilla to 2 Tablespoons. It turned out very good. It's a good base cake . Plenty of options came to mind after I tasted it. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This cake is awesome. I did add 1/4 tsp. salt to the recipe & increased vanilla to about 2 tsp. Sprinkled with powdered sugar & served with fresh strawberries and cream. Unbelievably delicious. Sometimes I want sweet - but not too sweet - this does it. I like this better than pound cake because it's lighter & softer. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#My granny made this cake all the time for my pappy. It was from scratch & made in a pyrex bowl. (smaller scale) But what she did that made it so great was to add while hot, the coconut and brown sugar icing. While the cake is baking, in a pan she melted 6 T butter, 3/4 c brown sugar, 3 T. milk and 1/2 to 1 c. coconut. Bring to a boiling point and pour over the warm cake. I punch holes in mine to let it seep in. Heaven! I have to tell you that I have looked for this recipe for years and this is as close to my granny's as you can get. Thank you for the recipe. So to those ladies who complained, sorry but cake is priceless to me. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#(3 stars to make a comment) No salt? I've been comparing this recipe to many others on the internet and this is the only one without salt. I would guess this is why some other reviewers find this cake bland. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#Extremely plain and flavorless. I have a favorite yellow cake recipe but always like to try new things just in case something better might come along. This was disappointing to say the least. I even added extra vanilla and a touch of cinnamon because the batter tasted like a boxed pancake mix and I always spice up my pancakes. If you like plain bland cake then this is for you.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Always requested by my children for their birthdays since it first came out in TOH in 1993. Truly delicious, especially hot out of the oven. I look forward to making it for my grandchildren someday. If you're looking for something especially sweet, this isn't it. To me, this is more like the flavor of a shortbread cookie. Great with a hot cup of tea, as one reviewer commented. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#good for my homework on a recipe with milk. i have tasted this and it is good.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Made this cake yesterday. Very easy to make and is absolutely delicious. I served it with strawberries and my husband loved it. I will be making this one again.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#could you tell me if you have ever put this in a bundt pan instead of the 13x9 pan?
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Great cake, just like mother used to make
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Just baked this cake and my husband loved it. It was very easy to make and delicious too.
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#I JUST HAD A QUESTION, BUT HAD TO ADD A STAR TO ASK IT SO I GAVE IT 1 STAR. DO YOU THINK THIS WOULD BE A GOOD BASE FOR TRES LECHES CAKE?
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I searched out this recipe because it's an old favourite of my husbands. His mom made it often and he missed it. He loved this and said it was even BETTER than his moms! You have to know what kind of untouchable reputation his mom has in his mind for baking to know what compliment this is lol! The only thing I didn't different was use lemon extract instead of vanilla and made a simple glaze with lemon zest in it. I think that the people that have bad reviews maybe over heated the milk which destroys the entire cake. 
Hot Milk Cake#2#0#I have made this cake on several occassions and it is a fantastic cake! It's halfway between a sponge and a pound cake. It's also a great base for cakes as suggested by others. I cannot believe some people think it's an awful cake! I have suggested this recipe to many people when they comment on how nice it is. Definitely worth a try! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Tender and moist... the very best cake for strawberry shortcake I've ever tried. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#It is a Great cake but as a coffee cake or base of lemon curd cake. pineapple upside down cake, or Strawberry shortcake. I will make it again!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#We've used this recipe for years for strawberry shortcake. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I was so excited to try this cake. Followed the recipe to a T. I cannot understand why it has good reviews...it is horrible. Utterly horrible. I would not recommend this to anyone. I cook all the time, in case anyone thinks I am a newbie...I am not. this recipe just is not worth making. Awful.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#it's so delicious , my kids just loved it,,,,,,,, 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Easy to make. Looks exactly like the picture. Taste is sweet and blah.
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#This was not one of my favorite cake recipes.
Hot Milk Cake#0#1#This was not one of my favorite cakes.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I made this cake for my husband's birthday. When I read the recipe, I was skeptical, as I had never heard of hot milk cake. I decided to try it because of all the great reviews. It was a bit more work than my usual yellow cake recipe, but it was well worth it! This is the fluffiest cake I have ever made. It was moist and light. I followed the recipe exactly. I think that beating the eggs for the full five minutes is essential. I made two 8x8 cakes and froze one for another day. I served the other one with fresh strawberries and light whipped cream. My husband raved about it. This is my new favourite cake recipe! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#love this cake!!!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Great tasting old fashioned textured cake.....plain or dusted with powdered sugar and fruit topping....DELISH!!!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Glorious. So simple and so good. A real discovery.... Moist, tasty, great consistency and it keeps great. I suspect the time invested beating the eggs paid off. Thanks a lot...and to those considering whether to bake it or not: do it, there is no going back
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I did a demo in high school home ec on this cake (my recipe is very close to this) 46 years ago and I still make it. The ingred. are usually on hand, its fast, and wonderful with fruit. It is so adaptable, I have added plain blueberries to it, serve with fresh strawberries and whip cream instead of those dry round things, your family will never want to go back. I have also used pinapple cooked with small amount of sugar and cornstarch for a great topping, cooled it and then top with whip cream and sprinkle with coconut. my recipe makes a smaller cake and only uses 1 c. flour 1 t. baking powder, 1/4 t. salt 2T butter , 1/2 c. hot milk ( I use buttermilk) 2 eggs, 1 c. sugar and 1 t. vanilla directions same except for 9X9 pan 350 degrees for 25 min. Just the right size for a small quick dessert for fresh fruit.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Lost my Hot Milk Cake recipe years ago. Had been making it since I was 9 yrs old, now 68. Had come from my grandmother.I will try this one. Hope it is the same. Sounds right. Thank you.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I have been looking for a recipe that fits the picture description of this cake for quite some time. Firm, fine crumb, spongy soft texture... and this recipe delivered!!! It is fantastic. Worked as a cake, worked as cupcakes. I have 150 pages of yellow cake recipes and this one immediately has jumped to page#1. I do have a question. Does anyone have baking times for baking 6 , 8 , and 9 round versions? My first attempt at a round (6 ) was still not done after 25 minutes, and unfortunately, I could not leave it baking any longer...Any advice would be appreciated!Thanks again for the GREAT recipe. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I had given up on finding a delicious light and moist yellow cake recipe. I am so happy my sister in law suggested I try this recipe. My search is over I have found my forever yellow cake recipe. This recipe will not disapoint you.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#just made this cake for breakfast this morning to have with hot chocolate and it was delicious! Will definitely be making this again!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#very good as a snack with evening tea
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Very simple recipe...
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I have made this recipe three times already. It's an absolute hit with my friends! I would recommeded this recipe to anyone and everyone! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Perfect...as is or anything!!!!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I loved it especially for a tight budget! It's light and yet really satisfied my sweet tooth. I also love how versatile it is...can go with anything and/or you can adapt it to anything. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I loved it especially for a tight budget! It's light and yet really satisfied my sweet tooth. I also love how versatile it is...can go with anything and/or you can adapt it to anything. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I just finished making this recipe and it's definitely going to become my go-to cake recipe. I cut the recipe in half and used a 9x9 glass dish and cut off like 10 minutes of baking time and I am so pleased with the results. A perfect, spongy cake. Very easy to make and not time consuming at all. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I used to make this as a teenager because it was so eash to make and always turned out well. My problem was that the batter was so good I would eat a lot of it before it ever hit the oven.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#My husband had had this cake as a child and wanted me to find a recipe so I turned to TOH. He loved this when I made it and said it was even better than he recalled it! It was moist, light and airy - very, very good - with or without frosting!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Moist, delicious, and easy to make cake. I will definitely make this cake again!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Absolutley love the flavour of this cake. My first try turned out more like a pound cake probably because I may have overmixed when adding the hot milk mixture to the flour but as I like a heavier density cake, I am OK with that. I will definitely make again.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Moist & delicious Hot Milk Cake Recipe. I baked it in a Jelly Roll pan, & it turned out great.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Just made this today and it is a good basic cake that is easy and quick. I baked my in a bundt pan for about 50-55 minutes. I only had whole milk, used organic unsalted butter, decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, increased the vanilla to 2 tsp, added 1/4 tsp salt (my mother was an excellent baker and even when the recipe didn't call for salt, she ALWAYS put a little in all her baked goods), I also added a 1/2 tsp of King Arthurs Princess Cake and Cookie flavoring. The cake is similar to a pound cake, but not quite. I sprinkled it with confectioners sugar and will be serving it with fresh strawberries and whip cream. Next time I will try making cupcakes. I'll let you know if it doesn't work, but I have a feeling it will. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#So simple & so easy. My husband LOVED it & is very picky when it comes to white cake. Will have fresh fruit on the side next time. This pairs well with cream cheese frosting :)
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#So good .My kids loved it.I reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup and it turned good.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#i did this cake,it was so good and my kids loved it.Its light and delicious.I reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup and it turned very good.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#So delicious! My entire family loved it. The cake disappeared immediately
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Excellent Cake! I am so glad for the reviews or I would not have made this cake and that would have been our loss! Thanks for the recipes and the especially the reviews. They so make a difference!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#i made this cake, and loved it!! thanks for sharing it!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I've been making this cake for years, since I got the recipe from another poster on a cooking forum. I used it as my wedding cake.It is not as light and fluffy as cake mix cakes, and does have somewhat the consistency of pound cake. I like that and it makes it sturdy enough for stacking and decorating multiple layers.Be sure to beat the eggs the full 5 minutes called for or it will be extremely dense. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#The cake tasted good, but it was not light and fluffy. It was heavey and had the texture of a pound cake. Can anyone tell me what may have caused this?
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#so i have made this one several times now and turned out great each time. made as is, used lemon, butter, coconut instead of vanilla ...lol not all at once and have added cocoa ..all have been yummy and easy to make.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Very tasty cake will make again and again. Next time, I would like to try a little cinnamon in it. Also very tasty dunked into hot chocolate. My son wants to try putting a little cocoa in it. Yum can't wait to try many different ideas. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Great recipe! I like light fluffy cakes so I added some more baking powder and add a little baking soda.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Great, easy to make and lots of fun to eat
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is one of our favorite cakes to have during the week. I sprinkle powder sugar on it before serving it.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is a super good cake. I use it for strawberry shortcake and it has always been a big hit at my home. It is great plain too. Try it, you'll love it! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Amazing, simple and delicious. It's my family's favorite! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I was searching on line for a hot milk cake recipe a few days ago and came across this one! I was delighted with it! I decided to make it as a layer cake and put a seedless strawberry jam in the center, then after putting the top on I made a chocolate glaze to drizzle over it! We really did enjoy this! I also used whole milk instead of the 2%.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#ALL MY FAMILY MEMBER N MY SELF LOVE
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This has the taste and texture of the pound cake I remember as a child. Absolutely delicious.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Fabulous recipe - I use plain soy milk and it turns out great! In fact, I'm eating some now with peach ice cream and fresh berries. Yum! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This was so good! I swirled a 1/2 pint of home made strawberry jam in before baking, but I think next time I'll make two layers and put the jam in between the layers. I didn't have quite enough butter and it still turned out great! very tender, light, crumb. I really like this recipe thank you! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Excellent cake! I made coconut/pecan frosting for on it. Mmmmm!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I made this and loved it. Its simple and yet still good. and shes right it would work great with any fruit and even as a strawberry shortcake. but, for simple its still yummy and you can eat it without frosting.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is a really tasty cake plain, but I see some cherry sauce in it's future. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Not very exciting. It reminded me of eating the sponge cake part of a twinkie without the fun of the cream filled center. Would make a good cake base for a fruit topping, but it doesn't stand up well alone. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#My 11 yr old daughter makes this and without fail, it disappears fast!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Fabulous cake! I made this as the base for strawberry shortcake with fresh strawberries and Cool Whip - it was a big hit :) Thanks for the recipe! God bless.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#By the way, my second attempt was not as successful as the first (cake did not rise as high) and I have found that beating the eggs well is *very* important--you may need to beat more than five minutes!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Made this early one Sunday morning, when my daughter and granddaughter came up stairs for breakfast my daughter told her daughter that it was breakfast cake and she ate it. The following Sunday she asked if we could have breakfast cake again, yes we did!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#My Mther called this a hot milk sponge cake . We had it with strawberries every summer for years. It's fantastic! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is my favorite cake since 1993. My family loves it. I am making it today for my 70th birthday tomorrow. Love it.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I thought this cake was good but not really anything to rave about. If I ever make it again, I will probably make a frosting for it, poke holes into it for pudding, or cut it up to be used in some other sort of dessert.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Made this cake for the first time and it was to die for. Dusted some powdered sugar on the top. Next time, might add some lemon extract and zest to the batter.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is one of my favourite cake recipes. My boys always request it for their birthday. It is so easy and has a fantastic flavour and texture
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#We served this for my daughter's graduation. It has a wonderful flavor and texture. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Have been using this for strawberry shortcake. Very good!!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I, too, have been making this cake since the first issue of Taste of Home hit the newsstand! Love it plain, but it's also great with strawberries and whipped cream on top! 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Yummy! My 5-year-old helped me make this. The texture reminds me a bit of angel food cake but not chewy. Very sweet without any frosting or anything added. 
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#This is the best cake I have ever had. The ingredients are simple and readily available. Recipe is easy to make.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#love this cake. It was in the first issue of Taste of Home and it has been a staple in my home. Both my boys love it.
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#Delicious! We just made this cake today!
Hot Milk Cake#0#0#I love this recipe! The cake is sweet on its own so it's nice to add some whipped cream for a lighter treat! 
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#How do you think this would be with cheese tortellini?
Macaroni Coleslaw#2#1#I loved the flavor and texture of this salad. Not too sweet or too much vinegar, which is a common issue I have with coleslaws. The ratio of dressing to slaw is perfect. I didn't have to make any changes to get it right; 5 stars. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#2#2#After reading a lot of the five star reviews I made a double recipe for a church potluck picnic exactly as posted. It was good, but not great was the opinion of quite a few people. Luckily there were a lot of people so I only had a small bowl leftover. If I make it again I would greatly reduce or omit the vinegar in the dressing and not use the water chestnuts since, I asked, and no one tasted them in the salad. Maybe using sliced or slicing the whole and not chopping would have made a difference?
Macaroni Coleslaw#15#15#Very nice combination and very tasty. The only change I made was using a red pepper instead of a green pepper (personal choice). As others have said this recipe does make a lot. I halved the recipe and filled a 2 qt bowl. Several guests asked for the recipe. Will definitely be adding this to my recipe collection.
Macaroni Coleslaw#23#5#Made this today for a group of cowboys, to go along with chili and cornmeal muffins. It was well received! This will be my go to salad recipe from now on! I may add cubed cheddar cheese for the next time and for a more summer type salad I'll try adding sliced grapes. Oh so yummy. Thank you! 
Macaroni Coleslaw#6#0#Really like this, make it very often. Hard to find whole water chestnuts so I use sliced and cut them in half. I usually take the seeds out of the cucumbers with small scoop but probably not necessary. This is great for pot lucks.
Macaroni Coleslaw#7#6#Can you make it the day before?
Macaroni Coleslaw#14#14#I would make this again. Quite a nice salad enjoyed by my family. Tasty combination of coleslaw and macaroni salad. Good dressing, used Mayo. I typically don't purchase bagged coleslaw. I shredded cabbage and carrots. I left out the cucumbers. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#2#0#Left out cucumber and used mayo instead. It makes alot so it was perfect for neighborhood get together. Everyone loved. Will make again.
Macaroni Coleslaw#10#2#I've made this for almost all summer potlucks for a few years and everyone loves it, even people who claim to dislike Miracle Whip! It does make a huge batch, but my friends ask to take some home (when there are leftovers) and my picky husband will eat it for days. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#9#2#Absolutely delicious!!!!! I love this recipe. This is 2 of my favorite parts of summer. Coleslaw and pasta salad. I never thought of putting them together. This was an instant favorite in my house. The only change I made was I grated fresh carrots and used fresh cabbage.
Macaroni Coleslaw#12#1#Wow, I've never heard of macaroni coleslaw! Love finding new recipes. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#7#1#Made this recipe and was really surprised at how good it was, definitely a keeper!
Macaroni Coleslaw#12#2#When reading this recipe mixing pasta and coleslaw seemed a bit odd to me. We like pasta salad and we like coleslaw, but together? Just didn't seem right. I stand corrected. It is quite tasty and I will definitely be making it again. I did swapped out mayonnaise for the Miracle Whip. Recipe does make a large amount. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#7#0#This is my go-to recipe for a great picnic salad! I've brought it to camp-outs, backyard BBQ's, pot lucks, and I've made it for just me and my family. It's simple and absolutely delicious! 
Macaroni Coleslaw#6#0#This is one of my family's favorite salads and I make it quite often during the summer, but we do have it year-round. So easy to prepare and it does make a lot! Definitely a keeper! 
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#1#I used farfalle noodles. I like it.
Macaroni Coleslaw#2#0#Made this at camp. Was a HUGE hit.
Macaroni Coleslaw#2#5#Super salad. Wondered what I was going to do with the case of Kraft macaroni and cheese I bought from Costco because it had been wonderful when I was seven along with Spagetti O's. I obviously didn't grow up in a household where mom liked to cook. Anyway, the Kraft noodles were just the right size. I Like sweet dressings so Bottled poppyseed or the recipe from Joan's Broccoli Madness go great. The packages of three color coleslaw make this super quick.
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#1#EXCELLENT +
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Pretty salad that is very tasty. Adding this to family favorites 
Macaroni Coleslaw#2#3#This salad is a winner, I used a package of broccoli, carrot and cabbage mix and red pepper in place of the green. I also added craisins an used Maria callen
Macaroni Coleslaw#2#0#This recipe was super good and easy. I believe the yield says twelve but I assure you it would serve many more. I brought this up to my cabin during the fourth of July and it really went well with every main dish we made. I didn't have cider vinegar or celery so i went without and I still thought it was delicious. I would definetely bring it to a potluck to share with friends. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#4#0#Great recipe! I make this a lot when I'm having a crowd for dinner. Start out with a very large bowl...I made a mistake in not realizing how much this makes and had to change bowls three times for everything to fit. The dressing is outstanding! 
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#Man, this salad was awesome! I knew I would like it because of the ingredients but when my husband, whose system can't tolerate lettuce, took a fork of it and liked it, I was definitely sold. To top off the flavors, I added raisins and it was a show stopper.
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#Sooo very good. Even better next day. Made for a friend of mine and she said the same things about it, oh and my husband also. I may even try to add some finely chopped broccoli to it also.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#made this last year 3 times and everyone loved it. The water chestnuts are in the asian food section, they really add a great crunch. I used mayo (dont like miracle whip). I make the day before.
Macaroni Coleslaw#5#0#We loved this recipe!!! I am going to try it and add some Dungeness crab or shrimp and make it a dinner.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I made this tonight, but cut it in half for the two of us! I couldn't find the water chestnuts, and I added red pepper along with green. Really, really good!
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#I made this recipe but halved it since there were only two of us. It was absolutely delicious! Sweet and tangy and the pasta fit right in (I was unsure how it was going to be). I loved this and would make it again.
Macaroni Coleslaw#8#0#I made this as directed including using Miracle Whip for a potluck. Everyone loved it. Being a Hellmann's lover, that's what I used the next time I made it. Big mistake. It didn't taste the same so for now on it's Miracle Whip. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#4#0#Absolutely delicious! Perfect for a potluck. I do think it would be great with tuna,chicken, etc. Will definitely be making again.
Macaroni Coleslaw#2#2#This is really good, and makes a substantial amount for a pot luck. I'm wondering about adding tuna, cooked chicken, ham. pepperoni or maybe even cooked shrimp (?) for a summertime luncheon meal. I also like that one other poster added dried cranberries. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Delicious
Macaroni Coleslaw#4#2#Thanks for the inspiration! I changed it up a bit and used red onion, green and red bell peppers, skipped the cucumber and water chestnuts. I also cheated and used Marie's coleslaw dressing to make this in a pinch. Lastly, I added Craisins. This served a crowd and the combo of crunchy slaw and pasta was delicious! Next time, I'll try the homemade dressing.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Excellent! I used regular mayo. Nice mix of pasta and coleslaw. Great dressing!
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#1#This is very good. My husband really liked it and described it as fresh. I used light mayo, 1/2 of a larger red onion and no water chestnuts. Nice make ahead salad. The dressing was lighter than I expected (a good thing). Maybe the light mayo? 
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#I've made this twice now and it is always a hit! It has quickly become a family favorite! Perfect for a potluck! 
Macaroni Coleslaw#2#1#Yummy! Makes a large batch. I do not care for Miracle Whip on sandwiches, but figured the sweet flavor would work well in a coleslaw and it does. I used 1/2 of a small Vidalia onion rather than 2 whole onions, seeded the cucumber before dicing it, used 1/2 the suggested sugar, and thinned the dressing with a little milk. I cut up the coleslaw mix into smaller pieces and wilted it (combined coleslaw mix with the salt, placed it in a colander and pressed the mix with a weighted plate for about an hour or so) before combining with remaining ingredients. This is a wonderful potluck dish. Anyone who likes coleslaw should enjoy this recipe.
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#1#I found this a very pleasing salad and have made it twice now. The first time I stuck to the recipe and found it sweet but the vinegar also played off that sweetness. The second time I cut the sugar. While I thought it was still very good, there was something to be said for the sweet against the tang. Either way, it is good!
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#You know the recipe is good when you bring home an empty bowl and people ask for the recipe!
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#Really enjoyed!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Not a fan of cole slaw but love this salad. The crunch from the veggies and adding the pasta make it so good. My new favorite summertime salad.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#1#What a tasty combination! Who doesn't like cole slaw or macaroni salad?! This is my new go to recipe for pot lucks, funeral receptions, and family gatherings. I omit the water chestnuts as they don't seem to offer much taste and there is plenty of crunch without them. I also have begun substituting Marie's Cole Slaw Dressing (refrigeration section of grocery store) in that I believe it has just the right tang. This has been a popular salad wherever I've brought it. Thank you, Sandra, for sharing a real winner! 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#1#Excellent recipe. A little different than the traditional cabbage salad. I use mayonnaise and tarragon vinegar! Joyce Moynihan. Volunteer Field Editor.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I have been making this for years, minus the water chestnuts. I am often requested to bring my Funeral Salad to Church when a luncheon is being served following a Funeral. It is so well liked. I'll try adding the water chestnuts next time. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Wonderful summer salad! I used mayo
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#If you substitute tarragon vinegar for the cider vinegar this dish goes to the next level.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#New favorite salad!!!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This recipe is a big hit at any gathering. I added a little shredded cheddar cheese and bacon bits and it was a big hit!
Macaroni Coleslaw#3#0#I love salads like this except that now it's almost impossible to find the little ring noodles. Last time I needed them I had to order them from amazon. What is up with that? 
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#Excellent salad! Even better with cubed cheddar cheese added......gives it more flavor!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This salad was easy to prepare it and it makes quite a bit, perfect for a crowd! It was bland for me. I feel like it needed more seasoning. Might try some seasoned salt next time.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#OMG this is so good! Instantly became a new family favorite! Will definitely be making this often over the summer, and all year through. Excellent!!
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#This is delicious and makes enough for quite a good sized group. People love it when I bring it to a potluck.
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#I was so surprised at how good this is, I made it for a church potluck. I was not so sure about it with the peppers and cucumbers but would not change this in anyway!!
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#I wouldn't adjust anything and typically I am a mayonnaise fan. This recipe is so tasty! I will definitely copy it and put in my old fashioned recipe box as a keeper. Thanks! 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Something a little different but so tasty. I halved the recipe but next time will make a full batch. Was well-received at our barbecue.
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#1#SOOOOOOO GOOD!!!!! I had to go out and get the Miracle whip even though I had mayo. Made it and it was all gone in a couple of days! And its only my husband and I. I did decrease the sugar a little just because I don't like slaw that sweet but this will definitely be made over and over again! 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This was a great recipe. The only change was substituting mayonnaise for the Miracle Whip. Everyone loved it. No leftovers.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#We don't like water chestnuts, but wanted that crunch factor, so we added a chopped up apple instead. Try it! 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This is such a different take on either a coleslaw or a macaroni salad. The best of both worlds! I didn't change a thing, and I really like the Miracle Whip dressing. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#2#0#Is that 1&1/2 cups or just 1/2 cup of Miracle Whip Light(1-1/2 cups Miracle Whip Light))
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#A fresh salad, pasta adds a new twist.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I made this for a baby shower and everybody raved about how good it was. I added fresh dill (lots), intimation crab, 1/2 of the onion and red onion instead of yellow and I used Mayonnaise.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I used mayonnaise instead of the Miracle Whip and added some salt and pepper. Good coleslaw recipe but now I want to find a recipe for the reverse...macaroni salad with a bit of coleslaw mixed in.
Macaroni Coleslaw#7#0#I doubled recipe and my husband took it to his weekly softball game/potluck - he just came home with the (huge) bowl completely empty! I followed the recipe except used Best Foods mayo, and added celery salt instead of regular salt. Also added a bit of Coleman's Dry Mustard and celery seed - like I would have for my usual coleslaw. Anyhow, it was obviously a big hit. This might be my weekly potluck contribution from now on! I wish I did not work on game days!! 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe! We are not Miracle Whip fans, so I did substitute mayonnaise. I also cut the recipe back quite a bit for the two of us. This recipe is a nice twist on traditional coleslaw and I will definitely be making it again!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Big hit! I've made it twice and will be making it again
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Very good! It does make alot. Will make again
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I make this for my club meetings, I use a Vidalia Chop Wizard, it makes it easy to chop up everything. The bowl always comes home empty. Everyone, including myself, seems to really like it. Thank you so much for a good recipe.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#1#Hubby made this for a company Healthy Living Salads contest and I was lucky to get a cup to try! He used full-fat Miracle Whip and packaged pre-cooked rigatoni that he chopped up which was a little chewier than homemade. He cut the onion to one and used a mild onion. The chopping is a chore to say the least but he likes doing putzy stuff like that. Using sliced water chestnuts would trim some of the time off. Since he made it the night before, the dressing and onions had time to mellow.Exchanges I'd make in the future would be half Miracle Whip and half yogurt, trying plain and then lemon. For salad meal, I'd add add cheese cubes, ham, chicken, summer sausage, that lonely hotdog and sunflower or pumpkin seeds. Maybe whole grain pasta. Fresh or frozen peas, maybe pineapple tidbits or tomatoes.This was good as is but can be used as a base to expand ingredients. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#I've made the recipe many times as written.......it is very good! Everyone wants the recipe! It's so nice to give a great review to the actual recipe....not how it's been modified into something totally different...... 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I didn't care for it. It sounded good, I thought I would like it. It makes a lot. I took it to a large gathering and brought a lot of it home. I will never make it again. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#1#Excellent! Everyone really loved it? Only difference I made was using Mayo instead of MIracle whip
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Very good! Worth chopping up all the veggies.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I just made this salad.......awesome!!!!! I didn't put the chestnuts in the salad. (I don't like them.) I will make this again..... 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I like both coleslaw and macaroni salad but I thought this might be really odd to taste. I added green onion and red onion instead of onion. I omitted the green pepper and water chestnuts. I added 2 chopped fine hard boiled eggs to it. In the end I also sprinkled a bit of turmeric to it. This is absolutely delicious! I love it, thanks for the recipe, even if I made it my own. Try it, its sooooo good!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Delicious! I made this for a church cook out yesterday and it earned rave reviews. It makes a lot so it is a handy recipe to have on hand when you are looking to serve a crowd. Folks liked the additional vegetables along with the macaroni and cabbage. I used mayonnaise, red onion and green onion along with red bell pepper. It is a very adaptable recipe.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This was very yummy!!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I served this for 4th of July yesterday. I thought I'd like it better than I did. It made a lot, which was a plus, but it was really missing something in the flavor. I found it unappealing and wished I'd served something else. Inhad 12 people for dinner; people ate it-- I had half a bowl left over. My husband said it was okay, and that he liked it well enough, but I didn't notice anyone really excited about it. Too bad. It sounded like something I'd like.Perhaps I'd like it with a different dressing. I think the dressing was a deal breaker for me. Maybe I'll try it again but use a favorite coleslaw dressing on it instead. Also, I wasn't crazy about the chestnuts. If I do it again, I'll use chopped jicama instead. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Fresh taste and crunchy... Yum! I was looking for something a little different -- and this did the trick. I did not add the water chestnuts and reduced the onion.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This was so good. I don't think I will ever make just plain coleslaw again. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#Very delicious!!! Substituted green peas for the green peppers and loved it! Used whole wheat pasta & mayo & splenda & seasoned with white pepper & celery salt. Pasta box was 12 oz, so increased amount of dressing by adding some olive oil & more cider vinegar & sweetener & seasonings---perfecto! Thanks for sharing!!!
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#This is a wonderful recipe, very full of flavor and texture. It has become a new family favorite. Thanks for sharing!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Mix together macaroni salad and coleslaw. The perfect way to UP each dish!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This tasted really good, and fresh. Has the taste of regular slaw but adding the pasta really brings it all together. Makes a large amount and it takes a huge bowl to mix it in. Definitely will make again.
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#The Macaroni Coleslaw was the BOMB!! I doubled up on the recipe so I would have enough for a crowd.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Made as directed. This is amazing!!!! Everyone love it.
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#Made this today. It's now my new favorite salad! Delicious! My family loved it! It was easy to make but let me warn you! It makes a lot! Thanks for sharing! 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I haven't made it yet but sounds promising 
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#Wonderful love it, my family loved it too
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Edit: made with miracle whip light. Was much better. Especially the next day.This looks and sounds unappetizing, but intrigued by the numerous 5 star reviews, I went ahead and made it. I only had low fat mayo (no miracle whip), so I used that. I only put one onion in because it looked like a lot, but might add half or all of the second one.I was expecting it to taste like coleslaw AND macaroni salad. I think it pretty much tastes like coleslaw with a bit of pasta added. It makes a ton.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This is an awesome dish! I made it as directed, except the onion. I only used one and it was plenty. Will make this again.
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#1#I have never been a coleslaw lover. But this sounded interesting. I loved it. My husband also loved it. It stays crunchy for several days. I did cut it down because it was only 2 of us, and I left out the green pepper, because I don't like that flavor. But I will be making this again. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#A nice change!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Very tasty and crunchy. I don't miss the full fat version of Miracle Whip at all. I used only one onion and that flavor still comes through. I also omitted the water chestnuts for my husband, but it still has a nice crunchy texture. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#A wonderful tangy salad! I love salads using Miracle Whip as they are so much more flavourful than mayonnaise. The crunch of the water chestnuts is wonderful. I use tri-colour coleslaw and leave out the green peppers as I dont like them.
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#I used Best Foods Mayonaise instead of Miracle Whip, and I really love the salad. My husband doesn't like macaroni salad and he would still rate it a 4. Took it camping and it was just as good on day 4. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#3#0#Wasn't a favorite. I didn't care for the vinegary taste. Wasn't creamy enough. I'm sure if you are a huge coleslaw fan you would love this recipe. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Even my non coleslaw liking kids, LOVED this recipe. Made dressing exactly as written, except I used colored, spiral Rotini and red pepper for color. Liked it even more the next day!!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I added crispy bacon to this and it was wonderful.........
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I was so disappointed with this recipe. It tasted like sugar and vinegar. I double checked and measured correctly. It was not edible.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Excellent! I made for 1st time at a birthday party and everyone gave thumbs up.ITSA keeper!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Loved the if this salad, and the ingredients, but there just wasn't enough flavor for me. I will try it again, but next time I will add the same ingredients I use when I make cole slaw and see if that helps. It needed more tang . 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This salad is delicious! Added tiny cubes of ham to add a little protein. SOOOO GOOOD!Definately will make this recipe again! A new family fav! :)
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#A big hit with family & friends. Love the crunchy vegetables!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I have made this recipe several times. Each time it became a favorite of all who ate it. It is now on my list of favorite salads to serve.
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#I no longer make plain coleslaw. This is my go to recipe. I don't change a thing in this recipe, its awesome as written. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#won 1st place at my work potluck in the salad category! Love this salad!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Made this for the 4th of July & everyone enjoyed it. This one is a keeper.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This is a perfect recipe for feeding a crowd. It makes a huge bowl of wonderfulness * I did spruce mine up a wee bit by adding some extra spices * Everyone really enjoyed this recipe.Janie
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I thought it was delicious. Took a big bowl to a church potluck, and most people passed it by. I think if they'd have TRIED it, they'd have liked it. Dumped out a lot of it, sadly. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#1#I can not make macaroni salad or cole slaw. I tried this and it is a winner!! I used Hellman s mayonnaise instead of miracle whip and did not use water chestnuts because I don't care for them, I did not have them, and it just sounded weird. Took it to work and everybody loved it!! They wouldn't let me take the leftovers home. Awesome. Recipe! Thanks! 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Delicious! I doubled the recipe and took for a large group campout. Nice change from the normal macaroni or coleslaw.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Delicious! Made this for our Memorial Day BBQ and it was hit. Everyone loved it including my husband who is always hesitant to try new things. He said it was a nice change from my regular pasta salad and to add it to the rotation!
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#Yummy! I sure will make it again. 5 Stars.
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#1#delicious...I took this salad to an 8 year olds birthday party and ALL the kids had seconds...they loved it...I loved it.....almost everyone loved it!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Yummy
Macaroni Coleslaw#1#0#I give it 5 stars
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I made this and it is delicious, I had lost the recipe, so glad you posted it.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Amazing taste. Great change to the basic coleslaw. I saved this to my favorites. I didn't have miracle whip so I used mayo. I didn't have celery . So I added 1/2 of celery salt instead of plain salt. I also sliced up carrots . Yummy, yummy!! Will be making this again 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I really liked this recipe. I also added raisins for flavour and color. Delicious!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This salad is so refreshing! I used Truvia in place of sugar and turned out great. It is hard to find diabetic friendly recipes that our whole family likes. This is a keeper.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This is terrific! The textures are very appealing and the dressing is one of the best I've ever made. My new GoTo Coleslaw. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#My family loved this recipe. I omitted green pepper and added red pepper. I made as written once, but since then have added shrimp and used Mayo. I will take to family reunion potluck. I may try some of the other variations described here.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I made this over the weekend and it is just awesome. Will be making this often.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#To sweet. I added mustard and it cut the sweetness but still did not care for it.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Perfect summer salad! Absolutely delicious!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This a fantastic salad. It makes a large amount so it's good to take to a cookout party! 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Already made it three times. Use Hellmann's and apple cider vinegar. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#it is great
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I have made this recipe several times & each time it turns out GREAT!!! And, there are never any leftovers....a big hit! The pre-made coleslaw mix helps make the recipe easy, the vinegar gives it a little bite.....EXCELLENT, HIGHLY recommend this recipe!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I took this to Bunco and everyone LOVED it! It wasn't as good the next day or two though. I didn't add the water chestnuts because I didn't have any and don't like them. I also used green onions instead of some of the regular onion. The last time I made it I added a little jalepeno for some spice and that was awesome. I'll add it every time now. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Tried this recipe with regular mayo. Oh it was so goooood! My husband had 3 helpings. I will make this at work, too! Thank you Sandra!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Made this for a potluck. Everyone loved. Will definitly be making this again. Yum Yum
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I have made this dish a few times and will be making it again this weekend. I also have had requests for the recipe.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#served this at a potluck last nite. everybody loved it. will definetly be make this again. didn't have peppers so i used radishes and i also omitted the water chestnuts. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I have made this recipe repeatly - have passed the recipe to lots. Love it.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This salad was just okay. I wouldn't make it again. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#The absolute first time I have ever been so impressed with a recipe that I felt I had to rate it. This is excellent! The dressing is so good and the longer the salad sits the better it gets. This one is a keeper!!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#It tasted fine but it just wasn't enough for me to want to make it again. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#It tasted fine but it just wasn't enough for me to want to make it again. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Loved it
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I made this for Labor Day and it was a huge hit with many of the guests and I plan to take it to a pot luck picnic this week. I used half Hellman's Mayo & half Miracle Whip in the dressing. I substituted red pepper for the green pepper and left out the cucumbers. It has a great crunch and know we will enjoy it many times over. Thanks for the recipe! 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I made this using only one onion, the small shells and substituted mayo for the Miracle Whip. My family loved it, but I do intend on trying some of the add-ins that were suggested.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Sorry, hate to write a negative review, but thought this was terribly BLAND. Added a bit of horseradish, celery seed, more vinegar, salt and pepper, and more Miracle Whip to get it just ok.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#What an absolutely delicious salad! I was pleasantly surprised to see that this salad is huge! Just the right amount of dressing for all the lovely ingredients... a definite 5-star recipe!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I just loved this recipe. I used green onions, and used broccoli coleslaw in a package. I also used the small shells and used 14 oz of those. I know I changed it up quite a bit but everything worked so well together. I did not use the water chestnuts, but this dish never lacked for flavor. It makes so much I take it to our Church dinners and any other get togethers. Yummy!! Debbie in Texas
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I have made this salad many times. Everyone really likes it. We don't like Miracle Whip so I use mayonnaise. Very good! 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I think you can use small macaroni in this recipe. It taste wonderful made with mayo instead of mircle whip. Good recipe
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Would be awesome with a little imitation crab meat added as well!!!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Made this for a family gathering, it was so Good !!!!! Will make it again.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Have made this recipe several times. Everyone loves it ~ yum!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Really good change of pace. Will use for get togethers this summer
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Yum! Love this recipe. This will be my go-to side dish for family get togethers/potlucks. Love the noodles, gives it such a good texture. I cut the recipe in half.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#The BEST salad ever. People who don't like Coleslaw liked this one. I did not use water chestnuts, and substituted Splenda for the sugar. Delicious. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I made this to bring to a party. I may have to make it again so I have enough to bring! I cut the sugar, used mayonnaise and a 16 oz. bag of coleslaw. Delicious.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This is very good. A nice change from the traditional coleslaw. I didn't add the chestnuts. Family enjoyed it. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Made for a family get-together. Everyone loved it!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This recipe is so good! I took to a fish fry and was a huge hit....everybody loved it!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#yummy! I used mayonnaise instead of Miracle Whip.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Everyone loves this. I only use one onion. It makes a lot and tastes delicious. I also added chopped peanuts to the top. This is a keeper!
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I have this and been told it is best ever Cole slaw , but to cut calories I sub half mayo for plain yogurt still get rave reviews
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This is an AWESOME recipe, and I look forward to making it again. I did use regular mayonnaise, and red wine vinegar instead of regular vinegar. I also omitted the salt, it wans't missed. My husband liked the way it complimented the honey sauced chicken nuggets, and helped us get out of the winter doldrums. My daughter normally doesn't like the veggies listed, but with them being finely chopped in the food processor, she never even noticed them, and had 2 helpings! LOL! Plan on passing this recipe along to my sisters and also my best friend for her daughter's high school graduation party. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Great recipe. Just different enough to be interesting. Love the crunch of the water chestnuts. Definite potluck material.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#This was easy to make and surprised a lot of people with how good it was! Even my father in law who never eats pasta salads thought this was delicious.
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I used Hellman's Mayonnaise instead of the Miracle Whip Light salad dressing. It was yummy. 
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#used mayo, very good
Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#Very intering combination witht he pasta and coleslaw. I was weary at first if it would be good, but after tasting it everyone really enjoyed it. I made half the recipe (still a lot of salad) and I used bottled coleslaw dressing. Will make this again!

Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I made this dish for a birthday party yesterday and it was a big hit! Everyone was asking for the recipe. I used a mixture of red and green pepper, did not use water chestnuts, and added real bacon pieces. I did not use the dressing mixture, I used a whole jar of Marie's Coleslaw dressing which is awesome. Will be making this dish again.

Macaroni Coleslaw#0#0#I used Miracle whip for the salad dressing and it was great. This is my new favorite summertime salad.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#4#0#This has been a family favorite for probably 20 years. I don't really change anything. The only adjustment I made is that I now use chicken broth instead of water and bouillon and I use skim milk instead of whole milk just because it is what we drink. It makes a thinner soup which is fine but the original recipe is probably better but still great flavor either way. I also quit measuring everything. I just add as much or as little of everything that I want. Always good. It's hard to screw up. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#2#0#With all of the TOH soup recipes lately, I cannot believe they haven't included this one! It is absolutely fantastic! I have been making it since I first saw it in the TOH magazine years ago. I do use much finer chopped onions (practically minced) and smaller pieces of ham, but I don't change anything as far as ingredients. You can use canned potatoes and carrots if you are crunched for time. BUT, how disappointing that the editors have not included this recipe in the all of the soup recipes -- with two posts about the 80 best soups , how could this one not make it??? Maybe I missed it... Anyway, this recipe if a KEEPER! Yum! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#2#6#I wish I could save these changes without a review because I really dislike when people change a recipe and still review it. Since TOH doesn't have the option to make notes, here goes. I made this heart healthy by deleting the bacon and sautéing the onion and carrot in olive oil. After that, I added chicken that I had baked separately and used 2% milk and 2% reduced fat cheese. I followed all of the other directions. My family loved it. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#1#1#How could you go wrong with ham AND bacon?! Sounds good to me! I added two sticks of chopped celery, grated my carrots and used red potatoes. I had one cup of heavy cream I wanted to use up so I made the difference with the whole milk. I also had pieces of frozen bacon ready to add. It was like a stew, thick and good and we liked it that way! Yummy!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#3#1#Lovely, but I substituted ham with chicken :)
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#1#Good soup for fall and winter. Served with biscuits or cornbread. Great way to use up holiday ham.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#4#1#This is always a hit in our house. The kids and I made one summer evening a while back, and we now make it about every month or so. We add a freshly cracked black pepper and sometimes throw in some celery, even add croutons when serving. Great hearty dish.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#4#1#I too used low sodium chicken broth instead of water and bouillon as this would be my preference. I had a problem getting my diced potatoes to consistently soften up so the next time I make it I will be sure to cook them in a separate pan and add them in at the last minute with the cheese and ham. This was a good use of some leftover ham steak and I also had two leftover ears of sweet corn I used rather than the canned corn. I could have used an extra ear. My only other substitution was to use two 4 oz blocks of Velveeta cheese cubed up as I did not have shredded cheese on hand and this melts in better anyway. It is tasty and no celery that my husband would prefer I not use!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#4#0#Excellent and easy! Chock full of flavor and texture. I used half the bacon, and it was great. I did add some diced celery.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#2#0#This soup is delish! Rich and thick. I often will substitute half and half or heavy cream for part of the milk. It's a very forgiving soup for substitutions. Bbutler....I have frozen it without any problem.. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This soup was great. My family loved it
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Yep... everyone was right! This was delicious and absolutely worth making! I am sure I will be making this again whenever I have leftover ham.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#2#1#Make this soup!! It is absolutely delicious. My husband (not a fan of soup) even asked if I could make it regularly. The flavors and texture were perfect. I normally never use bouillon but did in this recipe and it was fine. This is a real winner.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#1#1#This recipe was absolutely amazing. I am going to have to double it next time because my husband and two sons almost didn't leave me any! So flavorful and satisfying. I used chicken broth instead of bouillon and water. It's definitely going into the rotation! Thank you!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#1#2#The recipe tells you to put 2 cups of ham
Cheesy Ham Chowder#11#0#The best soup ever, so very full of flavor and is often requested by my mother, daughter & grandson. I would prepare meals for myself then take half to my 91 year old mother and she so loved this soup that she requested it at least once a month. I ran out of cheese once and It is great even without the cheese. I moved mother in with me when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer and she eventually got to the point she could no longer chew. I would then blend this soup so she could just swallow and still have the nourishment. Now that she has passed, I always think of her when I make this as this was her favorite. I'm sure that once you make this soup it would be requested by your family and become your favorite too.. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Can this chowder be frozen?
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I have read this recipe over and over again, and no where does it tell me how much ham to use. Mis-print maybe?? Or advertising blocking the ingredient?
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Great taste! Quick & and easy. Next time I ll use a little less cheese. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Anyone ever try making this into a casserole?
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This is a great recipe! Since my husband is vegetarian, I used bacon flavored olive oil to saute the onion and carrots. Then I used veggie bullion instead of chicken and replaced the ham with sliced Litelife Italian sausage. My entire family actually prefers the veggie version :) 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I did id not have bacon so used butter to saute veggies. Added 1/2 cup celery because I like it. This was excellent and very filling. I did notice that when reheated is was much thinner but still tasty. Will be making again soon.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This was a great hit at a big family get-together. Will make it again and again.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Used ham instead of bacon, it's a keeper! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#1#0#Use frozen diced hash browns to speed up prep time
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#My family loves this recipe!! It's absolutely delicious! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This was good the first day, but the second day it was awesome after the flavors had time to meld. A hearty, delishious soup. I used 1/2
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This is a very tasty soup! The ham and bacon combination really put it over the top! One of our favorite potato soups I have tried!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#You will want more than one cup for a serving! Even children love this one.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This was a very good Soup. My family really enjoyed it. It was a very simple recipe to make.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Delicious!!! Will start adding this to our dinner rotation.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I make this several times in the fall and winter. Served with biscuits or cornbread it makes a hearty dinner on cold evenings
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I've been making this for a couple of years now and it is wonderful! We love it! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#1#0#Oh, this is so very good! Keeper! It has 2 kinds of pork, potatoes, lots of veggies..creamy, cheesy, sweet corny goodness in a bowl. Rich
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#My family asks for this recipe often. It is easy and delicious. Nothing is better on a cold winter day. I serve with a green salad and good homemade bread.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Made this last night so we can come home to it for dinner today. It's very yummy and tasty, however, it came out pretty thick. A little thicker than we wanted. What do you gals suggest I add to it to cut the thickness? Water or milk? 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Loved this chowder. My husband said to be sure and keep this recipe. It did take longer for the potatoes to cook, so prep time was quite a bit longer. I did remove some of the bacon grease, and it still thickened fine. Will definitely make again.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#this was really good, though I did make some minor changes. I used frozen, thawed country style hash browns (so easy, since they're already diced), I added a bit more flour to make it thicker, I used chicken broth in place of water, I added thyme, rosemary 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I made this for the first time last night. Took a little longer than I thought but my family LOVED it. Even my picky 5 yr old. Will definitely make it again
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Used chicken stock for the water and added thyme and garlic powder to taste. Wow, what a great chowder.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This recipe was awesome. My family
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Our son loved this soup
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#1#Kids love this! I make it at least twice a month, regardless of what time of year it is. The only thing I do different is add more flour (oh, and minus the carrots, because.. gross) because the kids like it a bit thicker. So delicious! It's one of my go to recipes. Made it so many times I don't even need the recipe anymore. You won't be disappointed! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Delicious chowder that I will definitely prepare for my family again next fall/winter! The only thing I did differently was add fresh garlic.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Awesome Chowder, super easy to make and delicious!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Made this soup for the first time, and it won't be the last. It is truly great tasting. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Not that this recipe needs another 5 star review but this truly is a delicious chowder. I avoid chowders because they're usually way too thick and heavy. This was neither, just a perfect balance. I used 2% milk and reduced sodium chicken broth for the liquids and I added celery and thyme as suggested by other reviewers. I will make this again. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I added celery, 12 oz. of frozen corn instead of canned corn, I added thyme lemon sea salt.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This recipe made me want to sign up after trying multiple others over the past few months.If you haven't made it yet, make it.The author is a culinary genious. I love it.I removed the carrots, and onions, and added some garlic powder, as well as some extra ham, but this recipe is fantastic however you like it. It's open to customization, but if you like the vegetables, there's no way you can go wrong here. If you like garlic, I would definitely recommend adding a light amount of it. Don't overdo it, the flavors in this dish shouldn't be overthrown by the garlic. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I had never made a soup like this. Very good, will make it again.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#My kids (and their friends) now call this Halloween Soup because I make it every Halloween. As adults, my kids still come over in October and request this soup. I always have to make a double batch with extra bacon. So satisfying.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This was amazing! I love my soups a little on the thick side and this one fit the bill. The flavors were perfect. Did not change a thing. Thanks for the recipe.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Absolutely delicious! Wouldn't change a thing! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Very good! Easy to make especially with leftover Easter ham. Not low calorie by any means. :-)
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#WONDERFUL CHOWDER! Although, don't use packaged shredded cheese ~ it curdles. Still tastes fab but doesn't present as well. A DEFINITE KEEPER! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I really liked. Jim and Austin so-so. Ashley- big NO
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#simply delicious. It only needs a couple TB of bacon grease. Also, you should add a dash or 2 of sage(or thyme) and a dash of garlic powder. These additions make it perfect!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Made this for Dinner tonight and it's very good. I didn't have bacon so I added some extra ham. I will definitely make this again. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#1#FANTASTIC! I included several minced garlic cloves along with the carrots & onion and sauteed in chicken broth as I used pre-cooked bacon. Also, used half evaporated milk and half 1% milk. Lastly, I used ham soup base/seasoning as alternative to the chicken bouillon.Some may find it somewhat thick/hearty.... very easy to thin with chicken broth.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Fantastic! Even my 12 year old twins who are NOT soup people proclaimed this the best soup they've ever had! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#OMG! What a delicious soup. My husband wanted a soup the other day and a knew I printed this and I've been trying to make for a while. It turned out to be so hearty, thick, sweet tasty soup. The YUMS and MMHH were as loud as the clinking spoons on every bowl. I used beef bouillon instead of chicken(out of stock) lol. The potatoes, carrots and corn are perfect match. The bacon turns out to be almost difficult to notice, but you can still taste it. PERFECTA! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This was great and the whole family enjoyed! The pickiest grandson asked for seconds . . . a first for him! Thanks so much, will make again soon.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Outstanding recipe. I used smoked ham steaks, used white pepper, and followef a recommendation of adding thyme. I also used ham stock insteak of the recommended chicken bouillon. Tossed two diced stalks of celery in with the onions and carrots and minced a couple cloves of garlic. I also used half and half in place of the milk. I'll make this a couple times every fall/winter. Great flavor. Even though it's thick, oyster crackers work well. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I thought this was a great recipe! I just added a bay leaf, thyme and garlic powder to add more flavor. I also added more chicken granules to it. I did double the recipe as well. Turned out great!!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I make something very similar to this and my crew loves it. Only difference is I use chicken broth instead of the bouillon and no bacon. Good stuff!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Great soup! I did cut back on the amount of bacon grease I used, seemed like a lot. Used 2% milk, it was fine. My finished soup was a little thick so I added a little chicken broth until it was perfect.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I am so happy I found this recipe so simple quick and delicious. My family loved this and asked when I could make it again. The only downfall is I didn't find this recipe sooner!! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Great way to use up leftover ham.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#very good
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#OMG, I have made this soup 3 weeks in a row & my family want it again tomorrow for Sunday diner! Since we are all dieting, I put in zucchini instead of potatoes Even my little grandchildren love this!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I thought it was amazing and full of flavor. Probably my favorite chowder recipe to make.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#this chowder is fantastic - thick and creamy and just plain yummy. I used 2% milk and it worked just fine - also, being a ham fanatic, added a bit more ham. Just love this, as did my husband, the chef in our house!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I made this tonight with leftover ham from Easter . My husband loved the sweetness of the corn and the saltiness of the ham. I cut this recipe in half and used skim milk. It turned out great. Goes well with homemade corn bread.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#We really enjoyed this recipe, however, it is very high in sodium. Will probably make it again, but not on a regular basis.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Very good!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Made this today for supper and was somewhat disappointed. It wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be. I have to wonder about all the folks who thought it was delicious. I would rate this recipe as not that great and somewhat below average. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Phenomenal!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Delicious!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I skipped the bacon as well, and used a couple glugs of olive oil to saute the vegetables. The chowder turned out great! Lots of prep time and cook time with the layering of ingredients to the pot. But it's worth it! Delicious and great consistency without heavy cream. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I wasn't feeling well so I cut a lot of corners here and it still came out great (and my kids liked it too). I used canned everything-- potatoes, carrots, corn, peas-- and skipped the bacon and onion. And we were short on cheese so I used a half jar of cheese wiz. (Don't judge.) Very tasty soup. Thanks for sharing this very adaptable recipe! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This is so good! How can anyone think it's boring???!! Satisfying & comfort food at it's best. Every time I make it, someone wants the recipe, made it for a party & handed out 4 or 5 copies. I use turkey bacon from a local shop, only 5 slices since there is plenty of ham. I also use whatever cheese I have on hand, it's good with mexican or mont jack mixes. You can use more vegs, I tweak it every time I make it according to what's in the fridge, very forgiving recipe. Thanks! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Pretty good weeknight dinner recipe and easy! All the kids really liked it (4,3,2) I didn't mix the bacon in the whole pot because I figured the kids wouldn't eat it like that. So just crumbled in mine and my husbands separately. Good either way! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#My husband loves chowder. I have never attempted to make it because he is so particular about it. My kids and husband loved this! I was just trying to find a way to use some leftover Christmas ham and stumbled upon a 5 star dish for my family! No easy task!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I thought It was boring
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#That was really good. I used half the cheese. I'm sure you could add a few spices oe vwggies to change it up but this is definitely going into rotation for the winter! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Easy to make. Tastes OK. I'd call it average. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Very delicious and easy! A nice, hearty soup.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#So good!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Supper good!!! I like to make a recipe as written the first time I make it.The second time I made this I thought I would lighten it up, it's to goodto eat just a cup of.... So I used smoked ham with no bacon. Pet milk anwater for milk and half as much cheese. Added 2 cups celery andmade some creamed corn to add as well as the whole corn. One tblspflour instead of 3. Still very good and I think it was alot less calories. Iused home canned corn, and never add sugar to it when I can it. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Make sure you use quality cheese for a good cheese flavor. It was delicious.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#cee-jay you can use chicken bouillon cubes or chicken stock or chicken broth. I always use cubes with perfect results. Hope this helps. As for the chowder I haven't tried this exact recipe but I gave it 5 stars because I have been making something similar for many years and it is wonderful. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I made this the other day and it was wonderful! I substituted one cup of milk for one cup of half-and-half. It made a much richer soup. I also used chicken broth instead of the granules and water. I then served it with the taste of home recipe for bread machine garlic bread. It was a great combination!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Question: The stores no longer stock bouillon granules. What can be used instead? This soup looks and sounds wonderful.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#After lots of time spent dicing and chopping, plus the cooking time, I was very disappointed with this recipe. The chowder was beautiful but it had no flavor. I was expecting so much more, especially with all the onions and cheese that I put into it. I guess I'll have to keep looking for a good cheesy chowder recipe. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Tasty & easy to make
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Delicious soup! A great way to get my vegetable-hating husband to eat cooked carrots. It's a wonderful winter soup, filling & tasty. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Sorry I wasted good ingredients on this recipe.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Absolutely delicious! Whole family enjoyed it. It reheats very well.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Best and easiest chowder recipe I've come across. Add ground beef/turkey instead of ham and, BAM, you have Cheeseburger chowder. Love this recipe both ways! Kid friendly - My 1 year old niece loved it. (Used White Cheddar Cheez-Its for crackers and they give it an extra umph!) 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#1#0#Good flavor. My kids loved it.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Made this last night after seeing the recipe. Oh boy, was this ever good! With six kids still at home and it pleased each one of them. Two different things I did: I did not add bacon (didn't have it), next, I used deli ham sliced into small pieces. This is a keeper recipe!!! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Great use for leftover ham... rich, hardy soup
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This is so good, you will be happy you made it! Small changes, I used four strips of turkey bacon and less cheese. I can't wait to have left overs!! Yummers! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Perfect way to use leftover ham from Easter. Because I have to be gluten free, I subbed cornstarch for the flour. For my taste, there was too much cheese and next time I will cut it down to 2 c. or less. That is a personal preference. This is a hearty soup and is delicious. Thank you to whomever submitted it.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Excellent soup! We served it to ten and not one complaint. Definitely worth making again.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Oh MY! All the raves about this soup are 100% true. Delicious, creamy and hearty. Love the cubed ham and crumbled crisp bacon. The stock itself is flavorful and rich. It's like a loaded potato soup, but with extra cheese as the base. Even my two young, picky kiddos (age 3 and 7) gobbled this up and asked for seconds. Will make this a normal part of our rotation. THANKS for posting! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This is one of my favorite soup/chowder recipes....perfect exactly like it is written, no changes needed!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I made this for my daughter, son-in-law, and grand daughter (who is 1), and they absolutely loved it!!!! Its a keeper recipe for sure!!! I changed a couple of things, like I do to every recipe. I didn't have 3 cups of shredded cheddar cheese...I had an 8 oz block of pepper jack I grated and some pepper velveeta slices (about 8) I used. I added some thinly sliced celery and 2 or 3 finely chopped garlic cloves with the onions and carrots. I had some whipping cream I needed to use, so I used about 2 1/2 cups 2 percent milk and 1/2 c. whipping cream. I used about 4 cups of potatoes because my kids love the potatoes and used about 3 cups of ham. Served it with some mile high homemade biscuits and they all three pigged out!!!! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Great soup, tasted just liked scalloped potatoes and ham. I also used chicken broth instead of the water and bullion. Was afraid it would curdle while waiting for the potatoes to cook but it didn't. I will make again, thanks! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Made this tonight for dinner! It has been snowing all day and sounded like it was worth a try. It was! Fantastic dinner will definitely make again! Super easy to make!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#The whole family loved this. Great for those cold winter days.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This recipe was easy and delicious. We made it last night for dinner. Definite keeper to make again on a chilly winter night. I was slightly confused on the cheese because 3 cups would be 24 ounces, but the recipe says 12 ounces...I used 2 8oz bags and it was fine. I'm not sure in our house there is such a thing as too much cheese! :) 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Couldn't find my potato soup recipe so I decided to give this a try because it looked pretty close. I will no longer be looking for the other recipe because this one was even better plus it calls for cheddar which beats all the Velveeta in the old recipe. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#We loved the flavor and the consistency.. It was really easy to make.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#great for lunch on a very cold day
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Omg this is so good, full of flavor.This is such a keeper, my kids will love this when they come home in the winter months!!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Loved this soup! A meal in itself!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I made this recipe and really enjoyed it.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This was really delicious. I did make some very subtle changes. Instead of water and bullion I used chicken broth, and increased it from 1.5 cups to 4 cups (I found it just too thick at the provided ratios). I didn't have corn on hand so I upped the carrots and potatoes and also threw in a bit of diced celery, and also added a bay leaf during the saut?. And no cheddar on hand so I used gouda. I think any cheese, or mix of cheeses, would be wonderful.This is true comfort food, and I think a great base recipe for any number of variations. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Outstanding chowder! I made this for the first time, following the recipe exact; however, I did omit the cheddar cheese. I felt this was rich enough without it and still found this to be fabulous!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This recipe scared me at first! However, I am a big fan of consistent five star reviews, so, I tried it. Then, I saw the residual grease from the bacon and I was worried I'd find a grease puddle at the top of the soup bowl. I stuck with the recipe not changing a thing since it was the first time trying it.It was YUMMY! Hearty, rich, flavorful! Not dietary, but it was after Christmas and I used leftover ham! Very good! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Almost like a dip it is so rich. Little goes a long way
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This was the best chowder I've ever had. Nothing is more comforting or says home cooked like this hearty meal. If you are looking for a chowder recipe, do yourself a favour and look no further. Make this chowder. Right now. I I only wish I had had a biscuit to top it off ;) 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#My whole family loves this chowder. It's definitely comfort food at our house in winter. Love the idea of adding different veggies. Will try that next time. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I am not a big fan of ham chowders, but my husband loved this. I'll keep it in my recipe box for him. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This recipe is not only delicious but also versatile! Follow the basics but you can vary the veggies. Tonight I added diced zucchini! I cut back a bit on the bacon & cheese but it's still great. What a wonderful recipe for a chilly night! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This is by far one of my favorite meals from taste of home, this is how I got hooked, when a meal says 5 stars, they aren't lying, they truly are 5 stars!!!! Delicious meal, wouldn't change a thing:) use Cabot seriously sharp cheddar cheese! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Made this soup tonight following the recipe very closely and it was delicious!! I'll definitely will make this again. Only change I made was to use 2 cups chicken broth instead of 1 1/2 cup water plus bouillon. I don't keep bouillon in the house. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This is fantastic! I added some broccoli for a little more veggies. It's very filling, and it reheats well. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This was good. I halved the recipe, carefully staying within the correct amount of ingredients. There was not enough liquid in proportion to ham and veggies. This soup was tremendously filling - must be the cheese :)
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This is the recipe that officially got me into my mother-in-law's good graces. So so good. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Made this tonight and I will make it again! Yummy!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This was outstanding! Will make again. I served it with corn bread which made it the perfect meal on a rainy fall day.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Definately a 5 star but still needs a little something. I will try next time with some celery perhaps. Family did like it.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#My boyfriend and I made this tonight for the first time, and I'd have to say its the best chowder I've ever had. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Thank you all for the comments and reviews about my soup recipe. It is still a family favorite at my house! Now that the weather is turning cooler I can't wait to make it again for supper! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Delicious. My first time cooking soup from scratch . Made me look like a pro!!! I changed a few things...added 1 1/2 c of half and half, increased flour to 4 tbsp., left bacon and ham in for the simmering stage and increased the quantity of ham to 3 cups. Topped with additional sprinkle of cheese. Amazing. Thank you for this wonderful recipe. It will be a favorite in this family forever! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#WOW! This is the best chowder recipe I have ever cooked. I tasted it before I had added the cheese and it was great even with out it. I followed the recipe exactly. I had the chowder on low while we ate it and it did curdle up a bit. With the 3 cup of cheese it was great, but will try 1 1/2 cups of cheese the next time I cook this. Thank You for a Great Recipe!!!!!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This chowder was rich, thick and hearty and awesome flavor. Stick to your ribs meal in itself !
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I thought this soup turned out great! I didn't like the idea of thickening before the potatoes were added, so I mixed the flour with the shredded cheese and added it then. Also added more milk based on other reviews that said soup was too thick. Result was great soup, and it reheats really well the next day, too. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I would definitely make this again. I thought it came out a little thick and my boyfriend wanted more bacon, but those were the only complaints.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Absolutely delish! Wonderful cheesy ham flavor. Creamy and soothing to the palate. A sure keeper that I will make consistently!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I didn't change a thing and it was delicious! Perfect for fall and winter. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Absolutely delicious and so hearty and comforting on one of these first really cold days of late fall. I added more corn and potatoes than it called for and it got a big thumbs up from my husband who is a big guy and loves rib-sticking comfort food!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Made this the other night and the family LOVED it. My husband and 2 sons worked outside all day (freezing out that day) so they were happy to come home to hot chowder. I did shred my own cheese like some recommended. Made homemade dinner rolls to go with it. The only thing I will change next time.....is to make a double batch. Thanks Jennifer for a great recipe.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This is fantastic and simple to put together! It is in my menu planner so I can access it whenever the mood strikes!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#The very best chowder ever. Friends loved it too and we all will be making it many times. Nice big batch for company. Didn't change a thing. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This chowder was delicious. As do most of the Taste of Home subscribers, I made a couple of changes (we can't seem to resist doing that, can we) -- I used low sodium chicken broth in place of the water and chicken bouillon granuals to reduce the sodium content and I didn't have cheddar, so I used a combination of colby jack and a couple slices of 2% Velveeta, because that was what I had on hand. I also used less bacon to reduce the fat content. Still an excellent chowder. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I have made this many times now, and I am pretty happy with the recipe. One thing I did differently was cooking the cubed potatoes in the microwave with some water for a few minutes before adding them as directed. I also have not added three cups of cheese, probably just one cup or less. Also, one time I used creamed corn in place of whole kernel corn for a thicker soup, and most of the time I do not bother with the bacon, but use 1/4 c of butter to saute the onions.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I didn't like the the fact that it was thickened first. I do that at the end. Soup was too hot, trying to get the spuds done and when I added the cheese, it broke. Looked yucky and no one ate the leftovers. Garbage can is happy I guess. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Very good chowder! I used cheddar cheese soup with 1 cup of cheddar cheese instead of the 3 cups of cheddar cheese. I also used canned potatoes and canned carrots. My husband loved it so much that he wants me to make it again!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I made this exactly as the recipe reads. It is good, but rich and a little heavy. It was good as leftovers. Not sure I will make this very often, but will keep just in case need some comfort food on a cold day.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I wouldn't drain the corn down the sink but into measuring cup then add water to make the 1 1/2 Cups of water required. Use this juice for extra flavor. This is one of the best chowders I have ever made thank you. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#1#This recipe makes the easiest and thickest chowder I could ever have hoped for! I will make this again and again. I eliminated the bacon and ham, used a little olive oil instead and it was awesome!!!!!!! Chopping the veggies fine in a food processor helped too. Thanks for sharing this versatile recipe!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Too bad there are only 5 stars! I made this for my son and I on Monday - we each ate two bowls and he took the rest home. I made it again Wednesday for another family and didn't get back home before my cellphone was ringing with their praises! I did take some hints from other reviewers by using pre-cooked bacon and some bacon grease saved in my fridge. I had frozen some homemade chicken stock, (which I always save when I am making enchiladas or casseroles with cooked chicken) and milk in place of water and bouillon, and as I only had 2 cups cheddar when I made it the first time, I added a cup of Colby-Jack I had on hand. It was so good I decided to use the same combo again. The first time I used a whole, drained can of Niblets, and the second time a heaping cup of frozen corn, thawed. Both worked great. I did finely chop a rib of celery to saute with the onion and carrot both times. I am delighted to have a new soup recipe that is so good I can't wait to make it again. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Very yummy recipe. I did need to add more liquid - 1 cup chicken broth and almost 2 cups milk. I also added the cheese after thickening the sauce and before adding the potatoes. It worked really well and was nice and smooth!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Appears some are using inexpensive cheese - no such thing - use the real thing - no problems. The bacon is good, but unnecessary, as the ham has the wonderful smoky flavor. I used olive oil in place of bacon drippings. Very good chowder and complete meal in a bowl!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Great. Hubby can't eat white potatoes so I substituted sweet potato cubes. Really good with the ham. A keeper recipe. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#this is for toothfairylin. The answer to your question is.. are you using cheese that is already shredded? I found this out the hard way when I was trying a recipe that needed shredded cheese. If you buy the cheese already cut up or shredded they add flour to it so it doesn't stick together. Also you don t really know how long that bag of sheese has been in the store. So freshness does matter. It is best to buy the cheese by the block and shred it yourself. Since I have been doing that, all my recipes that call for cheese have come out perfectly. I got this tip from Paula Dean. It was a question she answered from her cooking magazine. I hope this helped you. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Easy to make & a way to use left over corn from a previous meal. I added some celery which gave it some green vegetables without changing the taste.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#toothfairylin - try adding the cheese to the white sauce created with the milk, flour, etc., instead of at the end. I have a similar recipe and it works great.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Hello fellow cooks! We LOVE this recipe...have been making it since 2003. I DO HAVE A QUESTION I HOPE SOMEONE CAN HELP ME WITH: The first time I made this, it turned out perfectly. I have made this MANY times since but ever since then, when I add the cheese at the end, it all curdles and separates. I have tried adding it when the soup is hot and when it has cooled somewhat. Still the same result. It is still delicious but looks unappetizing. I tell my kids...now grown...just eat it with your eyes closed! LOL WHAT am I doing wrong?? After cooking for 50 years, it is rather frustrating. ANY suggestions would be so appreciated! Happy cooking! :)

Ever since, after I add the cheddar cheese at the end, it all separates and curdles. I have added it when the soup is hot and when it has cooled. Still the same problem. :(WHAT am I doing wrong?

Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This is one of my favorite soups. I just made it this week. It was wonderful.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#It is wonderful. I was wondering if anyone has tried freezing it?
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#My family loves this chowder. I added some extra cheese.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Great!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This is the second recipe I tried for a ham and potato soup and my family loved this one. I cooked it in the crockpot though, added all the ingredients at once. I didn't have bacon on hand so skipped it and my family still loved it so next I will add bacon to see the difference! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I've been making this for years, and it's one of our favorite dishes. Over the years, I have played with it. Now I add vermouth to the roux and different spices that we like. I use turkey bacon, which works fine with the addition of a little olive oil. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This is my favorite soup recipe now. It is delicious!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#It was outstanding. I left out the onions and carrots but it was still amazing
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#The recipe is awesome. I cut it in half and used fresh corn on the cob that I had cut off rather than the can corn. I also added white pepper which goes well with soup and potato recipes. This is a recipe that I'll share with a lot of people. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#SOOO GOOD! Love it. I added less cheese because it was already reach. I used Velveeta cheese to get this thickness and flavor before now I know what I can use instead of Velveeta.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I've made this soup many times since it was first published and everybody loves it. I usually use precooked bacon, I find there is enough grease left to saute the onions and carrots in. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#my husband love it
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#this is my family's favorite winter soup. They love it! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Great recipe. Didn't change a thing. Recipe claims it serves 10 but my family of 4 made the whole thing disappear. Will make again. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe! It is just so warm and comforting everyone loves it!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#My children loved this recipe
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Great tasting. Followed directions exactly and will definitely be making again!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I absolutely love this recipe! It wasn't too time-demanding and well worth the effort! I honestly can't wait to make it again! 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Adding this to our list of favourite family meals! I made the chowder ahead of dinner time and wasn't able to hold off eating it. Sooooo unbelievably tasty!! Thanks for the share:) 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This is fabulous! I used skim milk and otherwise made as directed!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#My whole family loves this chowder. I make it every time we have leftover ham. It is well worth the effort.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#1#This recipe is fabulous as written but still not simple enough for my teenagers to prepare without complaints. When it is their turn to cook we usually use three cans of cubed potatoes and skip the fresh ones. We usually use matchstick carrots so we don't have to chop. IF we use bacon we use real bacon pieces (such as Hormel) like you can find in the salad section of the store. We usually saute the carrot and onion in olive oil since I don't have bacon grease to use. Because I use canned potatoes I only heat it through before I add the ham and cheese. The whole family loves this recipe and it is not unusual to make a double recipe so that we can enjoy it as leftovers. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I make this a few times a year, and love it! I usually omit the corn, and instead of bouillon I always use 2 cups of milk and 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth. So delicious!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Been making this chowder for years...it is the Best!!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#Very good as is. I have used chicken broth instead of bouillon. You can add in any little dabs of leftover veggies to use them up and it is still good.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This is a wonderful recipe. Our family always enjoys it and I make it for company as well. It always gets good reviews.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This was really good. I chopped the carrots, onions and ham ahead of time in the day, so at dinner time I just had to throw it all together. I used frozen corn and thawed it first.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This is my family's absolute favorite. I got the recipe from a friend who changed it up a bit. We use beef granules instead of chicken, sharp cheddar cheese and add a can of creamed corn to the recipe...delicious! Perfect for cold winter nights. 
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#This is absolutely the best soup ever. A great fall recipe. Filling and delicious! My whole family loves it too!
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I make this chowder every fall. It is a family favorite.
Cheesy Ham Chowder#0#0#I made this for dinner & it was YUMMY. The whole family loved it, especially my 2 year old. I used bacon grease that I already had to saute the onions & carrots but I had run out of bacon so I didn't have any in the soup. I also didn't have cheddar cheese so I used colby cheese and I had to use 2 bouillon cubes instead of the granules. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This was delicious. Really liked the crust on the bottom. It was a little sweet, so definitely needed the ice cream. I will definitely make again.
Winning Apple Crisp#2#0#I baked it for the first time. It is very easy and delicious. Made few changes 1. Substitute brown sugar with Jaggery 2. Could not get oats so substituted with crushed oats cookies. 3. Instead of water and sugar used canned apple juice. The recipe came out perfect. SO easy and so delicious!! 
Winning Apple Crisp#7#1#My family has been making this recipe for probably 15 years but in the version I have all the ingredients for the sauce are halved (water, sugar cornstarch). That's what is making this version of the recipe way too sweet!
Winning Apple Crisp#3#2#I make a version of this with 1/2 cup each raisins and chopped walnuts. Found that it works best with juicy apples; otherwise, too dry. I think I used 4 red delicious apples last time. Oh, and 2 tsp of cinnamon helps to cut back on the sweetness. It is a rich dessert, but yummy!
Winning Apple Crisp#2#0#Just made this and it is super good. We had to add ice cream which just added to it. It doesn't have the soggy as some recipes. Will keep this recipe and make again. 
Winning Apple Crisp#3#2#My husbands favorite dessert. Make this at least once every year. So easy to make. Sometimes will skip the ice cream and drizzle caramel sauce on top (this will make it extra sweet). It's a keeper... 
Winning Apple Crisp#11#0#I cut back a bit on both sugars as other reviewers suggested. I added chopped pecans and cinnamon to the crumb topping, and it was delicious!! Next time I'll add additional apples too. 
Winning Apple Crisp#10#0#To reduce our sugar intake, I reduced both sugars by 1/3 and it turned out fantastic! I will definitely be making this again!
Winning Apple Crisp#25#7#Replying to David957 Please don't chastise Shaar. We all have our preferences and I look for warnings about recipes that are too sweet because I don't like too much sweetness either. If you'll notice many readers here have commented about this recipe being too sweet. If you like it that sweet, that's okay too. 
Winning Apple Crisp#4#1#This is delicious right out of the oven. Add a scoop of Caramel Delight ice cream and, WOW!
Winning Apple Crisp#4#1#This was good, but too sweet. I will cut down on the sugar in the syrup. Also, I baked an extra 15 min and the Fuji apples were still a little hard.
Winning Apple Crisp#5#0#Perfect apple crisp! This recipe is easy to make and it turns out amazing every time. Great fall dessert and even better served with vanilla ice cream!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#It really was not as good as i was hoping it would be. Turned out okay but not the best.
Winning Apple Crisp#2#0#This was a quick and delicious dessert! My family loved it! We have a lot of guests in the fall and I'm adding this dessert to my menu to serve.
Winning Apple Crisp#11#4#Im not really a big fan of apple pie or apple crisp but since it's one of my dad's favorite desserts I made it for him and I decided to try some of it myself with a little vanilla ice cream on the side... it was delicious, my whole family loved it!!I will definitely make it again!????
Winning Apple Crisp#5#21#So bad. The corn starch makes it extremely gluey and gross, and is completely unnecessary-- all you need is the butter chopped into the flour to make the crisp topping work. This tastes like something from Denny's. That's not a compliment. 
Winning Apple Crisp#2#0#Was excellent. Wouldn't change a thing! ***** 
Winning Apple Crisp#1#3#I chose this one of many I found because of its rating; however, it was just barely okay.I reduced the sugar in the syrup by a half -- there's enough sugar in the crumb mixture and the apples -- and it was still a bit too sweet. The topping was heavy in both texture and taste -- perhaps too much oatmeal. I noticed more dessert left on the plates of family members who usually clean them down to the porcelain. I'll look for another recipe. 
Winning Apple Crisp#3#0#i've never really baked anything and when I made this my family told me that this was the best apple crisp they've ever had. this dessert is so savory and when it comes out of the oven its delicious 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#The recipe was good and I loved it.
Winning Apple Crisp#2#0#This crisp is very good. Like others, I used half of the sugars and it was still very good.
Winning Apple Crisp#2#0#It turned out great, but I did cut the sugar in half for both the filling and crumble part. I also put in a little salt
Winning Apple Crisp#2#3#The crumb topping is good but the sugar part with the apples is way to sweet.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#1#I tried the receipt because is was an award winner, and it was my first time making apple crisp, however, I have tried a coworkers apple crisp and it was one of the best. I will make this receipe again because it was easy to follow instructions. The con, overpowered with sugar=4*
Winning Apple Crisp#0#2#Didn't turn out well. 
Winning Apple Crisp#1#0#Yummy - can't wait to prepare this scrumptious' dish of Apple Dessert! Thanks for submitting it!!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#It's a good easy to make recipe. Based on other reviews, I only used a third of the white sugar and 3/4 of the brown sugar. Came out great! The right amount of sweetness! I'll make it again!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Too sweet. Didn't care for all the oatmeal either.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This is the best apple recipe ever! There's no need to make an apple pie with crust after making this gem. It is extremely simple and the taste is phenomenal. If you love apple pie a la mode, this is the recipe for you! I get requests for it over and over again. The only change I make is adding an extra apple or so until the apples are piled high in the pan. I also split the apple varieties and use honeycrisp and granny smith. I use a little more granny smith than honeycrisp. Usually about (3-4) honey crisps to (4-5) granny smiths - dependent on apple size. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Folks who found this too sweet: Did you cut the white or the brown sugar or both?
Winning Apple Crisp#4#0#Only thing I done different was put the sliced apples in a bowl, sprinkled with cinnamon and mixed it up good before placing the apples in the baking dish and I also used pure almond flavoring in place of the vanilla. While still warm, top with scoop of ice cream and drizzle caramel topping over the top. Delicious.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Wow - this is wonderful. Family all loved it. I cut sugar by 1/4, added an extra cup of apples and sprinkled cinnamon on top before baking. I baked it as the recipe said for 65 minutes and it was perfect. Thank you!!
Winning Apple Crisp#1#1#Way too sweet The crisp topping was nice. There was a nice balance of oats to sugar and butter and flour. The apple mixture was horribly sweet. I love sweet, but after a few bites, I had enough. My son and husband who usually pick away at the rest of the pan finished theirs, but that was it. I was ready to throw the rest away when I decided to use it as a topping for steel cut oats this morning. With a ratio of two parts oat to apple topping it was perfect with unsweetened coffee. Next time I would cut the sugar in half. It is also a nice mix-in with Greek yogurt but as a dessert a big disappointment for such great reviews.
Winning Apple Crisp#2#2#I really don't like any apple desserts. After trying a friend's apple crisp, I thought I'd try to make my own. I'm so glad I found this recipe!!! Yes, it's sweet. It is dessert after all. A little bit is just enough! Perfect for gatherings. Thank You! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This is definitely the best Apple Crisp I've ever had. I have been making this recipe since 2013. 
Winning Apple Crisp#2#0#I tried this recipe with vegan butter to see if it would work as a dessert option for a vegan relative at Thanksgiving and it came out beautifully! You couldn't tell it wasn't regular butter. Will also try this with pears and peaches.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This was my first time making apple crisp and I thought it was very good. After reading the reviews with some saying it was too sweet, I only used 1/2 cup of granulated sugar and it came out perfect. I would use this recipe again.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This recipe was not to my liking. I found it to be overly sweet and I did not care for the crisp part, it was not crispy enough.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#1#I made this with some apples a friend gave me and it did not disappoint. It had lots of cinnamon flavor and crumbly crust which are my favorite parts! The extra liquid you prepare to add to the apples did make it a little on the sweet side, but I loved the addition of vanilla.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#It was okay. A lot of oatmeal flavor and not enough cinnamon. I like my recipe for Apple Betty much better.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#It was easy and delicious, but too sweet for me! How could I make it less sweet? I think it was the syrup.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I make this every fall...with Honeycrisp apples....Amazing!!!..
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I am not a dessert fan, but made this for my husband who is. I cut the recipe in half which was very wise of me...he almost ate it all, hence the 5 stars!!!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I am not a dessert fan, but made this for my husband who is. I cut the recipe in half which was very wise of me...he almost ate it all, hence the 5 stars!!!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Hello, can this recipe be done in a microwave as well, as I wish to try it out by this weekend. Thanks.
Winning Apple Crisp#1#0#Too sweet. Prefer a more traditional Apple crisp with a simple crumb topping. Made it for a second time tonight and confirmed the sweetness and twice the baking time is a good reason to skip it. However, if you are feeding people with a serious sweet tooth, this is great for you.
Winning Apple Crisp#1#0#Made it as written and used Granny Smith Apples. Just the right amount of topping and a good amount of apple filling. Will make it again.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Absolutely delicous! It was a hit with everyone. I made it as the the recipe stated and it was great. We liked the chewy, crispy topping but would have liked more of it. I will double that part when I make it again.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Delicious! I sprinkled extra cinnamon and sugar over the apples before adding the crumb topping.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Easy to make and family loved it. Delish!!!!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Delicious;!! I used Granny Smith apples and doubled the recipe. Made for group of 16 and everyone loved it! Put topping in bottom as suggested, did not count/measure apples, just kept piling them up till they filled my Pyrex dish (9 x 13) and put remainder of topping, as best I could, on top before pouring liquid over. Put pan or foil under dish since it will probably bubble over in oven. Served with vanilla ice cream, but excellent without!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I tried this using less sugar and more apples. Different than any recipe I've used in the past.Turned out fabulous. This is the only way I will ever make it from now on. I'm sure other types of fruit would be good, also! Thanks so much. 10*'s here! 
Winning Apple Crisp#4#1#My husband is not a big dessert person. 2 things he will only eat, chocolate cake and apple pie. So I made this and a asked him to please just try this. He did he loved it and took a big bowl of it. He said I can make this now in place of his apple pie.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Just made this today, it is excellent. I followed recipe as is and next time I will cut both the brown sugar and white in half. It is sweet as apple crisp is, but it wouldn't hurt cutting back a bit. Taste just like from a restaurant! :) 
Winning Apple Crisp#1#0#I agree, too much sugar! The second time I made it I used 1/2 cup of both sugars. I will use 1/4 cup the next time I make it. Delicious hot with vanilla ice cream!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This was really good but also very sweet. We really enjoyed it but like other reviews I will cut back on the sugar next time. I will be making it again!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Per the reviews, I cut my sugar to 1/4c. Brown and 1/4c. White and it was plenty sweet for us. I couldnt even fathom 2c. Of sugar!! Otherwise, it would be a 5 star.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This is a delicious crisp recipe, albeit rather sweet for our taste. The first time I made it I followed the recipe as directed. I now make it with half the sugar . I do squeeze fresh lemon over the apples to balance the acidity and sweetness. Next time, I plan on trying apple cider in place of the water and further cutting the sugar to1/4 c., for even more apple flavor. My husband craves this apple crisp as soon as the cooler fall weather arrives.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Easy and delicious !! I used Honey Crisp apples and will try other apples next time. There will definitely be a next time...excellent in my book !
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Definitely a winning recipe at my house! This is the best apple crisp I've ever eaten. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I have to say I was a little concerned because of all the flour and corn starch, but it was absolutely delicious!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I really loved this recipe. We acquired some apples from my son's tree which we believe to be a golden delicious. Therefore I did cut the sugar for the filling back to 1/2 cup and used 2 TBSP Apple Cider vinegar in the cup of water to tang it up. Of course I had to eat my first serving before it had cooled completely with melting vanilla ice cream on top. So delish, and I know it will be even better tomorrow after the flavors blend together. I will make it with granny smith apples and try apple cider instead of water next time and I believe it'll be perfect for my family's taste. Thanks so much for sharing Gertrude! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This is one of the best apple crisp recipes I have tried. I did cut back the sugars by half and will cut back more, next time I make it, as I still found it sweet. I did add some nutmeg and will add more cinnamon next time.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Love this! It's my go-to apple crisp recipe. I do also cut down on the sugars and go heavy on the apples and it is delicious. Love the way the crust/topping gets a little chewy/crispy. Sometimes I double the recipe in a 13x9 for company. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Very very sweet, even with cutting the sugars in half.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I thought it was amazing and will definitely make it again. I cut the whole recipe in half because I made it for just two people. I will probably cut back on some of the sugar also.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This was an awesome apple crisp, followed suggestions and cut both sugars in half. Loved the bottom crust !
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Even though I gave this recipe 5 stars, I think there is WAY too much sweetness with 2 cups of sugars. Fantastic recipe and this is definitely a keeper. I will just decrease the amount of both white and brown sugar the next time!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Everyone enjoyed this Apple Crisp. I diced the apple smaller then normal. Going to add peaches next time.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I would recommend cooking it an additional 20-25 minutes. I really liked my apples soft like apple pie and the topping more caramelized. It was fantastic!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I liked this recipe, but I thought there was way too much sugar involved! I cut (both) the brown & the white sugars in half, and the final result was exceptionally delicious. I made real whipped cream, to which I added some cinnamon while whipping it. Yummy....
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Excellent, thanks for sharing. My girlfriend liked it and she's pretty finicky. Great big ole spoon of Coolwhip was the only improvement here. Thanks again. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I haven't tried this recipe, but really want to find one similar to what I made as a teenager - WITHOUT oats! If carolanne1210 could share her tried an true , I would like to see if hers is made without oats. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#AMAZING.....i have made this recipe for years.....rave reviews wherever i take it....i use honeycrisp apples in mine. thanks for sharing!!!!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This recipe is fantastic!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Sounded interesting, so I gave it a try. This was much too sweet, and the bottom was hard. I'll stick with my old tried-and-true! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I thought this recipe was too sweet also and a little dry. I cut down on the white sugar, only used a 3rd cup and I added a few more apples to add a little more liquid.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#It was way too sweet. I could taste the brown sugar. May try again, but will cut down on both the white and brown sugars.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This was good except it was hard getting the bottom crust out when cutting and serving. The next time I make this, I will cut the topping in half and only put in on the top of the apples. I will also cut down on the sugars as someone else did.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Aside from being way too sweet, I thought it was good. Will make again, and just cut down on the oatmeal and brown sugar.
Winning Apple Crisp#1#0#We really liked this recipe. The first time I followed it exactly and it turned out great. Recently I had some pears that I needed to do something with so I pulled this recipe out again. This time I used a 9 x 13 dish; didn't use any of the crumbles for a crust; all crumbles went on top; and used 8 to 10 pears. The results were just as good and probably saved a few calories! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Very good recipe, followed it exactly and came out great.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Way to sweet for me. The cornstarch and sugar overpowered the apples.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This was easy to fix. Took this to our friends' house for dinner. Came home with an empty dish. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#good recipe:)
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This is great!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#It was good, but the cornstarch mixture was too sweet and overpowered the fruit and crisp even after reducing it. If you have a major sweet tooth this is a great recipe, but if you prefer your apple to be more prominent I'd suggest to go light on the sugar, cornstarch mixture. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I did not care for this recipe. I thought that the filling was too gelatinous and sweet.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Great recipe and everyone that has had it has loved it.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This recipe was WAY too sweet for my taste. I used a granny smith, a Johnathon & a McIntosh apple.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I followed the recipe. I thought the oats were a little crunchy. should I have used quick cooking oats? My husband loved it any way
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Great recipe to use with my own home grown apples. Awesome....
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Outstanding!
Winning Apple Crisp#2#0#My family loved it! I took the advice of another reviewer & cut the sugar in half & added an additional 2 cups of apples; the sweetness level was just right for us & the amount of apples was perfect! I used Cortland apples from a local orchard. I'd never made an apple crisp with a liquid poured over it & was skeptical. But, it was delicious! This will be the apple crisp recipe I make from now on! Thanks for sharing it with us. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Sooo good. Had 4 cups of apples already sliced and poured apple pie sauce (left over from canning apple pie filling) over them except added vanilla. Making crisp was so quick and it turned out just right.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This was yummy and very easy! I will definitely make this again! My husband just loved it, too!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Very good; probably the best crisp we have had. It was even better when I added chopped almonds to the top layer of the crumbly stuff. Next time I'll use 2 more cups of apples and 1/2 cup white sugar in the syrup instead of 1 cup; it was on the cusp of being too sweet. We didn't have ice or whipped cream, so this rating is just the crisp. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#The BEST apple crisp ever!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I tried the recipe an it is the BEST I have ever tasted. It is so nice and crunchy.
Winning Apple Crisp#1#0#Fantastic! It was even better cold the next morning. I doubled the recipe for five people and used a 13x9 pan. It didn't even last 24 hours! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I am huge fan of apple crisp, and this one hits the spot!!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I have made my apple crisp this way for years. It's been in our family since I can remember. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This sounds great
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Like Stoltzmj said, I have used this same recipe for years and years with rhubarb. Only difference is, I don't put anything in the bottom of the pan and put all the crisp on top. Also fold the apples or rhubarb in the sauce before putting in the pan so every piece is coated. Oops, I goofed. It is the apple one where I don't put anything in the bottom of the pan, but I do with the rhubarb. Sorry about that. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This has been my go-to recipe for the past 2 years for Apple Crisp. I have been told it is better than the apple crisp at the fairs. I make mine with Cortland apples and I am sure to use real unsalted butter for the topping - margarine doesn't do the dish any justice. I normally double the recipe and use a 13X9X2 pan. Thank you for such an amazing recipe! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Very good!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Sounds good
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Wonderful
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I have used this recipe for years with rhubarb, it is excellent. I will try it with apples, it should be good.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Ok
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Turned out very well. First time making it and the whole family was pleased.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Only one word.....DELICIOUS!!! We took it as an extra dessert to a birthday party. People were bypassing the birthday cake to get seconds. The pan was almost clean when we left! We had either vanilla ice cream or Cool Whip to put on top. Either one was good. Also, we used Golden Delicious apples. SOOOO good.

Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I made this as recipe is and it taste's good but I didn't like that the bottom layer was a little soggy so next time I make this dish I may change the layers to apples on bottom & crust on top and see if I like that better. Good recipe though would make again. Thanks. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#So delicious. It came out with the perfect balance of crispy and gooey.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Absolutely delicious!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Very, very good!!!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Excellent!!!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This is a delicious recipe. As suggested by others I decreased the brown sugar to a half cup. Wanting a little different twist I also added a package of Ocean Spray blueberry flavored craisins. It turned out to be a good flavor combination with the apples. Will be making this again.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This is such a great recipe! We did make a few adjustments. For the sauce to put on the apples, we halved everything except the vanilla. For the crust/crumb mixture, we only put in 2/3 cup of brown sugar. Next time we will try 1/2 cup as it was still plenty sweet! My husband made it and he loved how easy it was!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Great recipe! I reduced the granulated sugar by 1/3 cup, and it turned out great! Next time I will add more cinnamon to the boiled mixture.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This is THE best apple crisp recipe I have ever had! I added cinnamon to the cornstarch mix and tossed the mix with the apples before putting onto the crust. Can't wait to make this again!!! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I have made this many times for my boys. It's one of their favorites. My husband even likes it. The aroma of the sauce fills the kitchen when it cooks! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#So very disappointed with this recipe! It was terrible. I made this for a special occasion and it was like eating from the sugar bowl. YUK! I find it hard to believe this was a Winning recipe. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This has become a family favorite.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I've made this recipe for years. It is always a success. But about a year ago, my recipe was misplaced. I can't tell you how happy I am to have it again. I've got apples just waiting to jump in. Thank you so very much. blue99mustang 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#best crisp recipe I have tried....increased amount of apples, and put some cinnamon in the thickened sugar mix....loved it!!!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#While this recipe was good I found it to be a little too sweet. I will make it again but cut back a bit on the sugar. Maybe it's because I used Honeycrisp apples. My guests raved about it! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Took this to work and my co-workers loved it. I added an extra cup of apples and a teaspoon if cinnamon and a teaspoon of nutmeg to the cornstarch mixture then mixed it with the apples before putting it on the crust. It was awesome!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This is my new go to recipe. I should have doubled it in a 9x13 pan. Took to a get together and had none left for me. May add cinnamon to cornstarch sauce.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I tripled the batch and took small pans to all my elderly friends and they all raved about this recipe!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I made this for a family dinner last weekend and everyone loved it! I used a bit more apple than the recipe called for and I did mix the apples with the cornstarch mixture before putting in pan. The only thing I would change would be maybe a little more cinnamon. Put some melting ice cream on top--Yummy!!!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This is the BEST Crisp recipe. We LOVE IT!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#My husband and I love this easy-to-make recipe. It's wonderful. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I added a little extra butter and cinnamon-using a Golden Delicious apple- very very good!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#My first time making an apple crisp for company and everybody enjoyed. Very easy to make as well, definately will make again.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Can you spell MELT IN YOUR MOUTH or AMAZING! this is literally so fantastic! Especially when you get all those apples off your loaded apple tree(s). I've made this with windfall apples and it works phenomenal!!!LOVE IT!! TRY IT!! You can't go wrong! It's to DIE for!! YUM YUM YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I just snuck next door and picked some apples, then made this apple crisp. Absolutely perfect!! I normally tweek every new recipe just a little, but I did nothing to this one - no changes needed. I'm going to make this for a weekly badmitten tournament/potluck we go to on Wednesdays. It'll be a hit for sure!! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#OMg, I just made this for our First Night of Patriots Football Celebration and it is to DIE for!!! I can't wait to share it with our guests...that is IF there's any left by the time they get here!!! :) 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#The best apple crisp we've ever had. Hands down. Everyone loves it and it disappears far too quickly after I make it. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Delicious and Easy. Served this last night and making another batch for a picnic today
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This recipe was excellent. It was quick and easy to make. And the taste was great! This is a keeper.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This was wonderful! I got many compliments on this dessert. I'll be sure to make this again, yum! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I've made this recipe 3 times now, and every time it's been perfect! My family absolutely loves it, and it's easy enough to prepare for company, potlucks, or school/church events. It's a keeper! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#WOW!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#My Goodness what a wonderful treat for a cold winter day! I tried this last night for the very first time for my small group. Live in Florida and have a big cold snap. Everyone LOVED it!! Got rave reviews and they fought over who got to take home the small amount left in the pan. I had double the recipe for 12 people and it more than served enough. I used granny smith apples so the sugar amount was just right. No wonder it won a blue ribbon!!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This is AMAZING!!!! I doubled it for a houseful of company, and they ate every bit. So good, I did add extra spice, but a great recipe nonetheless.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I have made this 4 times now, once with apples, then with cherries, raspberry/blackberry and blueberry and all have been excellent. All but the apples were frozen fruit, I used about 3/4 to a pound of fruit. I cooked and lightly crushed the fruit in the water/sugar/corn starch mixture after it had thickened and cleared.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I barely got a slice my family devoured it! I will double or triple it next time...delicious!!!!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#My whole family LOVED this! Next time I will have to double the recipe because the entire batch was gone in a day! Loved the bottom crust. I added a little cinnamon to the apples before I poured the sauce over them. I made it twice in one weekend!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Oooohhh...so yummy!! I did substitute Splenda white and Splenda brown sugar since my husband is diabetic. It turned out great...he LOVED it. Perfect texture and oh my, the taste! Not to mention how wonderful our house smells. No wonder that it was a contest winner!!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This was super-yum! I made it gluten-free by using 1/2c sorghum flour & 1/2c white rice flour plus 1t xantham gum and Bob's Red Mill GF oats. I used 1/2 the sugar and made it in a 9x13 pan with 2x the apples (Granny Smith). I also added ginger, allspice and nutmeg to the syrup mixture. No one could tell it was gluten-free and it was WONDERFUL!! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I am a diabetic so I used Spelenda White sugar and brown sugar in the recipe. Worked great. Only thing the sauce you make with splenda does not get clear but taste is great. Better for us diabetic's.. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Didn't try yet!  But will definitely try it this Thanksgiving!  Thanks for making it easier to make! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Very good! Can this be frozen? I'm wondering if it will come out the same. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Excellent. Great flavor. I think I did something wrong because the oatmeal pieces stayed a little chewy. I used granny smith apples and they got very soft but they were delicious, Can someone help me out with the oatmeal problem? It is a great receipe. Will make it again and again.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#My family and I loved this Apple Crisp. It's a keeper. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#My partner and I like everything, including desserts in nice sized full servings.By increasing all the ingredients by 50% and using a 9x13 baking dish we were able to get 8 nice sized delicious servings.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I doubled the recipe- used1 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup splenda-always add more cinnamon,little salt, apple pie spice also added the apples to the hot mixture to cover better was delicious!!!! vic
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This has become our go to apple crisp recipe. Everyone who has tried it, loves it! Thank you so much!! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I usually put the cinnamon in the sauce and pour it over the apples. I like to serve it warm with vanilla ice cream. Delicious!!!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#made this tonight for dinner and WOW....a winner. Easy also. will definitely make again
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I just made this for the first time and it only baked for 40 minutes because then my oven caught on fire! LOL! Now I need a new one just when I was getting into a baking kick. This was good but it was way to sweet. Next time I'm going to cut the sugar in half. Hopefully next time I can bake it all the way and have better results with the modified recipe. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I have one question....what can I substitute for corn starch, which I am allergic to? Thanks!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Loved it! I've tried several Apple Crisp recipes and this one is the keeper! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Loved this recipe! Would definately make again.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#My sister's favorite dessrt is Apple Crisp. I wanted to impress her when she came for supper. She loved it and so did the rest of the family! Would make again. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This recipe was easy to make. I made more than one pan and froze them. The best apple crisp I have ever eaten. And everyone raved about how good it takes. Definetely a keeper in my box.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Had to use an 8x8 pan and this still came out wonderful! Was a big hit!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This apple crisp is delicious. It has very pleasing proportions of apple to crisp. I did make some changes based on other reviews because we don't like things as sweet as this would be with the called-for sugar. I cut the brown sugar and the sugar back to a little more than 1/2 cup each. I also used about 1-1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. I used 4 medium Granny Smith apples, which amounted to a little over 4 cups. In deference to my husband's trying to watch his cholesterol, I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter (and I love butter in baked goods). I must say the product lived up to its name! I will definitely make this again! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#We just made this tonight and it was SO GOOD!! I did cut back on the white and brown sugar though because my apples were already so sweet. I used a little over 1/2 of what the recipe called for. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I will make this again with slight modifications. I'm going to decrease the brown sugar to either only 1/2 or 3/4 cup, the full 1 cup was just a bit too sweet. I think I will also just about double the amount of apples, we found it heavy on the crisp and light on apple. Very good flavor! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Thi was a little different from most crisps I've made so I was a little hesitant, but it had good reviews so thought I'd go ahead and try it. It was absolutely fantastic. I won't ever make another apple crisp again, this is the ONE! My husband could not stop eating it. Thank you for this one. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I had a lot of apples left over from Christmas and I didnt want to lose them so I decided to look for a good apple crisp recipe and my first thought was to go to the TASTE of HOME website and I am so glad I did this is the best crisp recipe I have ever made its tastes wonderful! Thank you for sharing this recipe.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I made this as a sweet potato - apple mix, with a 4 cup mix that was slightly heavier on the apple side.I only made a half of the crust, sprinkling it over just the top of the casserole. It was wonder addition to our meal.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Amazing! This recipe was so delicious! The only change I think I'll make is to add less sugar and a little more cinnamon. Otherwise- DELICIOUS! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Should be called Best Ever apple crisp!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This recipe is amazing! So easy to make, even with my four little kids running around. My husband doesn't usually like these types of desserts, but he loved it!! Definitely a family favorite. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Made this while camping this weekend with our family. I doubled the recipe and came home with a small piece. Everyone said it was the best apple crisp they ever ate.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This was very good, easy to put together with ingredients on hand. I popped it in the oven while our guests and ourselves ate dinner. Everyone thought it was great and the smell in the crisp fall air was very inviting.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This is a great recipe. The topping on the bottom and the homemade vanilla sauce make it extra special.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#There is a web site for diabectic, with good reciped. you can also sub. for the sugar with splender. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0# Ask where you buy your apples. They will be glad to hep you. I like to use gala. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I think it is good to know if some of the people think the recipe is too sweet, as I don't like things that way, and I wouldn't have to make the recipe once to find out.  The people aren't trying to criticize the recipe, but only telling how they prefer it.  
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Re:Apple CrispThis is one of the best apple crisps that I've ever made.I took sguy's advice and added more apples and oatmeal and cut down on the sugar as the apples I was using were already quite sweet! 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I tried this Apples Crisp recipe and took sguy advice. It is the best! I'm making it again. 
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This recipe was good, but we found it too sweet and not enough apples. If I made it again I would cut the sugar back some and add more oatmeal.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This is the best Apple Crisp I have ever had bar none, even cold leftovers were great. Will make this one again.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#This was the best Apple Crisp I have ever had!!!! I will definately be making it again and again. I did omit some of the sugar because I used a sweeter apple and it turn out great!!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Yummmmmy! I used 6 large apples which was significantly more than 4 cups. And put only 3/4 cup of granulated sugar in the saucey part.
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#I found this recipe was much too sweet and not enough apples
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Re: Apple CrispMy family really enjoyed this recipe. I will make this one again. pcinant
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#The absolutelsy best!
Winning Apple Crisp#0#0#Easy to make and very yummy. My family gobbled it up!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Really enjoyed this recipe! Prepared this on the stovetop (which I prefer). Left out the celery and green peppers (which I don't care for). Also did not add any extra salt. Turned out very well! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Very good flavor and easy!
Forgotten Jambalaya#8#2#Very Yummy and my new Mardi Gras go-to dinner. I did follow the recipe ingredients, but I had rotisserie chicken and already cooked shrimp and sausage. So I slow cooked all the veggies and seasoning in the liquids for 4 hours on low, added the chicken and sausage for 20 more minutes and the shrimp for 5 more minutes - Voiila - it was great!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#1#We can't get enough of this flavorful meal! I wasn't sure how this was going to taste, but it will be one of my top meals because of the wonderful flavors. I plan on using the sauce/spice/veggie to make chicken cacciatore. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#1#0#Perfect for a cold winter day. We enjoyed the heartiness of it.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#1#Delicious and easy! My (picky eater)family really enjoyed this!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#My family loved this. It will be in the winter meal rotation!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#My husband loved this recipe! It's a keeper. Thanks for sharing. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#1#0#This recipe was very easy and the the finished result was fabulous! I can see why this was a contest winner! I used hot sausage because I did not have smoked. It gave just the right amount of spice to the dish. Will definitely add this to my favorites!
Forgotten Jambalaya#3#0#I made this recipe and made a couple very minor changes due to having certain ingredients on hand. I used chicken broth instead of beef, 1 1/2 pounds chicken tenders cut into bite size pieces, 12 ounces of smoked beef sausage and 1 pound of 21/30 shrimp. Everything else was as listed in recipe. I must say, the finished dish was EXCELLENT!! I would recommend this recipe to anyone and it would make a wonderful meal for guests. Five stars for sure!!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#7#Can you use regular italian sausage in this recipe? If so, would I cook it first and then put in slow cooker?
Forgotten Jambalaya#3#0#I've made this a couple of times and was wonderful each time. I omitted the cayenne and hot pepper sauce and instead added 1/2 teaspoon chile powder as my husband doesn't like it too spicy. I used 2 kinds of sausage and 2 lbs. large shrimp which we love along with 2 lbs. cubed chicken breasts. As other husbands have said, this is a keeper! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I have been making this for a long time. We love it. I believe I first got it from the comfort food diet cookbook. I put everything in it but the hot sauce. We don't think we need it. I have made this for several occasions and our friends love it also. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#1#0#I made this tonight. I didn't have any hot sauce, so omitted that. Otherwise I followed the recipe. My hubby said that's a keeper! Don't need the hot sauce for my family. I'll be making it again. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#1#I used my home grown tomatoes, and andouille sausage. This turned out Sooooo good!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#1#To much of a green pepper taste for me. My 15 year old said it was ok. My hubby seemed to like it.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Love the flavor! I didn't have the time to cook in the slow cooker. It was quick and easy in my Ninja Foodie using the pressure cooker feature. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Could I use tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes? Cant's wait to try the recipe. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This was fantastic! The broth is SO flavorful. A little bit spicy for the kids, but that's easy to dial back. I will definitely make this again 
Forgotten Jambalaya#1#0#VERY good. I left out the shrimp though, allergies here.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This was tasty, but the next time I make this, I will not use so much chicken and use more shrimp. I'll also cut down on the hot sauce. Everyone thought it was good and the 5 of us voted to do it again. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#2#Just didn't care for. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#1#1#We have been using this recipe since it came out in 2008. It is one of my family's favorite. We use it every winter and I have passed this recipe around dozens of times. The only thing I change is doubling the shrimp and chicken because my boys never feel like they get enough.
Forgotten Jambalaya#1#1#I made this yesterday, and it came out fine, it was tasty and spicy, but, I, like Deddmen, can't get over it not being like Jambalaya, since the rice is not cooked in the sauce, which is very soupy, more like Gumbo, but without the roux, which, I know, is what makes it Gumbo. Next time I will cook the rice with the sauce, not separately. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Thank you, SRAdair, for your review! I just got an Instant Pot for Christmas and am anxious to try it. This recipe sounds yummy, and I'm going to give it the Instant Pot treatment you outlined 
Forgotten Jambalaya#2#1#This is my go to recipe for entertaining. I start it eight hours before the dinner is served. The table is set and I can visit with my guest when they arrive with a minimal amount to do before dinner is served. This is a delicious dish. Served with coleslaw and hot rice. This one pot dish is easy to clean up and gives me more time with my guests.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#1#Super easy to make. This is my favorite Jambalaya recipe.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I made this according to the recipe and it was wonderful. Served it for company. Everyone loved it.
Forgotten Jambalaya#4#0#I lived in Baton Rouge, and I can honestly say that this is pretty good. Deddmen you can keep your real Jambalaya. You don't see me getting mad at non Hispanic restaurants for making Tacos. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#2#0#Calm Down, deddmen; you'll get your pressure up. ;0) There are all kinds of tastes; all types of cooks. This is a good crockpot gumbo-like dish ... works great for weeknights. Maybe sometime we can go down to Louisiana and enjoy real Jambalaya. This is fine for what it is. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#3#17#This Is Not Jambalaya!! This is some kind of sauce served Over Rice!With Real, Actual, Cajun Jambalaya; the Rice is cooked in with all of the other ingredients!! That way the flavor is In the rice Not Sitting On Top Of It!! I can't believe the other reviewers liked this recipe!!! They Must have been from up north or someplace where cooking with spice is a Novelty Thing! Come down south to the Jambalaya Festival in Gonzales, Louisiana one year and you'll taste REAL JAMBALAYA!! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Tasty. Did not have any shrimp so I skipped out of this ingredient and dish was still tasty!!!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#My family loves it!!!
Forgotten Jambalaya#1#0#This is the most wonderful recipe for jambalaya I've ever seen! I followed the recipe exactly (except I forgot the hot sauce). I left for a short shift at work and when I came home, 5 hours later, the whole house smelled heavenly. Thank you for the deliciousness! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#A wonderful recipe! I was short on time and made this in my Instant Pot. Served over brown rice. It turned out great! Definitely will fix this again and sharing with foodie friends! Second time: Again, in the Instant Pot. This time I sauted the onion, green pepper, celery for a few minutes then added spices and garlic and cooked about a minute, then added chicken and sausage stirred a bit, then added all the other ingredients. Then cooked on the slow cooker setting for 2-1/2 hours, added shrimp and cooked another half hour. I love this recipe. So easy.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Made this with some super spicy sausage, so cut back on the hot sauce just a little. Tasted great not crock pot like at all! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#2#Delicious!! We have to watch our sodium, so I made a few changes. Sodium free chicken broth, no salt added tomatoes, 1/4#smoked sausage, used no-sodium salt. Cut the sodium content in half. Absolutely delicious!!! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#1#0#Been making a similar dish for years. It may not be the authentic way but it sure works for me. Always a winner!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This recipe is one of my favorite weeknight meals! It is simple but packed full of flavor and hearty! I usually add about 1 Tbsp. Cajun seasoning to it as well just to add an extra kick. I recommend this recipe and have shared it multiple times! Definitely a keeper!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Wow!! This was great!! I used a spicy andouille sausage, so decreased the cayenne pepper a little, otherwise followed the directions exactly, and it was fantastic. Will definitely make this again
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I made this and it was AWESOME!!! It was super easy to prepare, had good flavor and was just spicy enough. I didn't add the chicken or shrimp - I used smoked sausage and kielbasa. I added more chicken stock - just enough to cover it! I will be repeating this recipe for years to come!!! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#My family LOVES this. I have to double the recipe, and it helps the diabetic's blood sugar, too. You can chop ahead and freeze the onion, celery and green peppers, and use prepared minced garlic (1 clove = 1 gently rounded teaspoon.) Freezes and reheats a treat. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Absolutely love it!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Made it for a family gathering and it was a big hit!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I'cve made this. It is easy, quick and very tasty. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Quick and easy; Basic recipe easy to adapt.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#1#This is a good basic Jambalaya recipe. All of the core ingredients are here, however the cayenne and hot pepper just make it hot. vs. a balanced blend of flavors with the other herbs. In order to supplement the flavor, we cut back on the salt and added Worcestershire. Made this due to the convenience of the slow cooker, however time permitting I would use my old stand by southern Jambalaya recipe in the future.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#3#This has to be the worst recipe ever! What a waste of good food in a poorly contrived meal. Is there a way to get my money back for all the fresh shrimp I wasted? Going back to the real recipes of the south!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Really good...used precooked frozen shrimp.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I had some experiments with that recipe but in Redmond 4500 multicooker. It is fantastic, really! I had a chance to compare rice- and multicooker, the last one much simpler and faster - any recipe can be made by my children.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Yummy! I omitted the shrimp to save $. Turkey smoked sausage is a healthy substitute for regular smoked sausage.~ Theresa
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I make this at least once a month -- we love it! I leave out the shrimp and just add more chicken and sausage since my husband doesn't like seafood. Couldn't be easier -- just chop everything up and mix it up in the crockpot! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I absolutely love this recipe. Perfect amount of spice and heat, so great to warm you up on a cold winter day!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This recipe is easy, flavorful and I will definitely keep it my recipe box!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#My family and I love this recipe. So easy and sooooooooo good!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#It's great 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I have never cooked jambalaya before but I think this may be the best tasting jambalaya I have ever experienced. I cooked it in low heat on the stovetop used orange bell peppers and previously baked chicken. I used original Conecuh hickory smoked sausage( an Alabama favorite). I will make it again
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Great recipe, really easy to get going in the crockpot and the whole family loved it. We have made this several times and will continue to do so!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#My husband who hates chicken, loves this dish. I've cooked it in the crockpot and stove pot and both are delicious. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#We both loved it! I've made several different versions of jambalaya and this is possibly my favorite. I was able to add the shrimp after about 3 1/2 hrs and I cut the tobasco and cayenne in half. It was perfect, my wife said. Will def fix again! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This was a very easy jambalaya to make. It had just the right amount of spice for me. Very hearty and filling.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Excellent! We love the flavor and it's easy to make. I'll make this often. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This just did not hit me like I thought it would. Like others, I think the cooking time was way too long and caused the meat to get dry. The overall flavor just wasn't there. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I absolutely love this recipe!!! I didn't like the overpowering smoked sausage flavor the first time I made this (personal preference) so I eliminated the smoked sausage altogether the second time I made it and it still turned out incredible! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This is so easy and so very good. I questioned whether Jambalaya made in the crock pot could have the flavor I so enjoy but I am now a believer. I will be making this again. I used imitation crab in place of the scrimp.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#My Savannah, Georgia bred husband says it is the best he has ever had! That's a winning vote in my book!!! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#1#This recipe is delicious exactly as written and with or without the shrimp. In spite of the long list of ingredients it is very easy and quick to get in the slow cooker, and especially easy when using frozen chopped onions and green peppers. I wouldn't change a thing. Received family stamp of approval! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Overall, this was good. It was a bit overcooked when I checked it at 4 hours. It was my first time using a slow cooker though, so that could be my fault. I might make it again, but it gave my husband heartburn last time.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't need any tweaking at all. I did have to turn the Crockpot up to high for an hour or so though. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This is a fabulous recipe! I've made it at least a dozen times with no modifications and it is a hit every time. I use frozen, uncooked and deveined shrimp when fresh isn't available. Yummy! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#My husband really liked this. Very spicy and flavorful.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Delicious! Will definitely make again!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Very good. It's a little on the spicy side and the chicken turned out slightly dry, very good overall though. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Love this recipe!! Great on fall camping trips!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Pretty good
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#We didn't know we liked jambalaya'til we tried this. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Solid thumbs up from the whole family. Decreased the hot sauce and cayenne to suit the kids' taste and just added hot sauce at the table. Also replace the green pepper with zucchini and okra, again, just personal preferences. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#1#0#My family loves this. I can't use shell fish because of allergies, but I just add more sausage. We lived near Cajun country, and although this is not what they would call authentic, it sure is good. Be sure to use quality Andouille sausage. It makes a big difference. We all love hot spicy food, so after the first time, I added Tony Chachere's as well as all the spices indicated. This is on my rotation of regulars. Thanks Cindi. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Oh my God we loved this recipe. I omitted the hot sauce and used chili powder instead of cayenne and it was good. Used a whole pound of shrimp also. The aroma is phenomenal! Will make again.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#authentic jambalaya or not it is fantastic! I had a pound of shrimp and just threw it all in - that's what my family kept picking out 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Mmm! I made this last weekend and I didn't even get seconds or leftovers. :( Sure is good!!! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This is a fabulous recipe!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This recipe does not taste like it was quick and easy to make! It is a wonderful tribute to real jambalaya! Everyone in our family loved it and was a perfect way to celebrate Fat Tuesday.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#My family loved this! I made with turkey sausage and served with brown rice.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I used turkey sausage and served with brown rice.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#So easy, so good....I have never been a fan of cajun food but this is delicious.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Excellent recipe. Great flavor. I cut some of the fat by using turkey cocktail links.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I've made this several times. Cajun is not always easy to do from scratch but this recipe is easy and very tasty. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This recipe is wonderful! My husband said it's the best crockpot recipe of any kind that I've ever made. I made it exactly like the recipe said...except I was out of parsley flakes. I don't know how much of a difference it would've have made because it was absolutely delicious! I was in a hurry, so instead of cooking it on low, I cooked it on high for about 2 1/2 hours. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This recipe is wonderful! My husband said it's the best crockpot recipe of any kind that I've ever made.

Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Since Miss Cindi is from Texas, I did not expect a Louisiana, let alone a New Orleans style Jambalaya! I found this Forgotten (Texas) Jambalaya to be very flavorful, and it certainly won?t be ?forgotten? in our home.I cut this recipe in half since there are only two of us. I used only ¼ tsp each of the hot pepper sauce and cayenne pepper to suit our personal tastes, and I found Andouille sausage at our local supermarket. Served it on a bed of Jasmine long grain rice. My daughter suggested adding 1 tsp of file powder the next time I make this. Thank you Miss Cindi ?
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Used turkey sausage and omitted the shrimp. Excellent!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This recipe takes a lot of prep time but after you throw it in the crock pot, it's all worth it. The seasonings are just right and it makes a large amount. I ended up freezing half. Great for watching football! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#very tasty.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Wonderfully easy and flavorful.
Forgotten Jambalaya#1#0#I know from watching Emeril that Jambalya normally uses Andouille sausage, but here in rural, Western PA we just don't have access to it. This is the third time we've made this recipe. This time we doubled the chicken, shrimp, tomatoes and seasonings. My family is giving the altered recipe a solid 8 out of 10. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#great,easy to make
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Tweeked the spices to fit my southern tastes. Wonderful,best I've ever had or made. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Make this one all the time its one of my go to recipes. Wouldn't change a thins 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#have made often. have frozen, but kept shrimp separate and only added before serving.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This is a great dish for a cool night very easy and everything was flavored just right
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This was soooo unbelievably good! I only made a half recipe to try the first time, and I didn't have shrimp, but it was so good anyways, the flavor was perfect, not too spicy. And of course being able to throw it all in the slow cooker is such a bonus! I use mine as often as I can to make life easier. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This is delicious! This is not a dish we come across often (I live in The Netherlands) but I love it. Like other reviewers I did not change a thing. It is a little spicy and has lots of flavor, I can truly recommend this. Thank you for sharing!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This was the easiest and tastiest Jambalaya I've ever made. I wouldn't change a thing! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Easy to make and just spicy enough for the whole family to enjoy. I will add this to my keepers list and wont change a thing! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#absolutely amazing... great with and without the shrimp
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#making this again tonight. I thought it was good, not amazing but good. My bf on the other hand really really liked it. Guess it depends on what kind of taste you have
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This is so flavorful and yummy. I love that it has a bit of spice and great texture. I didn't need to change anything, including the cook time, which is amazing in itself! I make this frequently! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Wonderful dish, full of flavor, try with confidence.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I made this as our after-church meal for Christmas Eve. Everyone really liked it! It was great to be able to put it all together earlier in the day, and then just add the shrimp and make the rice when I got home. I'll definitely make this again. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This was an amazing crock pot recipe! I added 1 lb of shrimp and a lb of cut up tilapia! The fish was my favorite! I think I will try chicken thighs instead of breast next time though. Definitely a keeper!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Super easy and tasted great
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This gets 5 stars for the ease of preparation and taste. I used less heat but that is a personal preference. Just dump it in and you're done! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This has become a staple in our house! I've made it with Chirzo sausage, so good and gives that extra spice! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Yummy!! everyone in out house loved it!! we like things a little spicier so we put in extra hot sauce and cayenne pepper
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Great flavor and very easy to make. It is definitely a keeper . We have made it several times already. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#My husband loves Jambalaya so i decided to give this recipe a try.It was extremely easy and both of us loved it.He said it's a keeper.I did leave out the celery because neither of us are fans. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#My family really enjoys this recipe. It's smoky, spicy and flavorful. Good Cajun flavor with milder heat. I've used the recipe several times now and they always ask for more. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I've made this for about 5 years now and it's become a winter staple! Such a easy recipe and all of my family love it! Thanks for a great recipe! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This recipe was so easy and delicious! I substituted smoked turkey sausage for the regular sausage.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#We made this last night and no leftovers for today! This is delicious and so flavorful. Made it like the recipe says with only these substitutions...had boneless, skinless thighs instead of the breasts and used a precooked package of shrimp. The chicken thighs were just as good in it and I stirred in the shrimp just before serving, long enough for shrimp to get hot. This dish is spicy but not mouth burning spicy. As my hubby said, it is spicy but not enough to make his bald spot sweat! We will definitely be making this again!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#My family feel in love with this recipe. I found it very easy to make with no fuss or bother. It is a great meal if you need a quick meal that has substance to it.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Loved it. We forgot to put the shrimp on the night we made it and it definitely was missing something. We added shrimp on the second day and it was perfect! Definitely a keeper, perfect with freshly baked bread to dip!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Very good, but mine came out a little soupier than I expected. The leftovers thickened up and were perfect! I served it over brown rice. Next time I will use large or jumbo shrimp, the medium shrived up too much.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#1# Just omit the shrimp.  More than enough protein/meat to make this dish.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This isnt something I would normally make but I was wanting to branch out a little. My family loves this which was a shock. We have been making it on a regular basis for years now.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Great flavors!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Whenever I make dinner, it is rare for the whole family to agree on it. I rated this 5 stars because most of us enjoyed it. My hubby loved the shrimp, my mom loved the sausage, and my aunt loved the texture. One of my boys loved it but the other didn't. It had extra kick because I used a can of diced tomatoes w/green chillies. Overall, 4 thumbs up, 1 1/2 thumbs down (1/2 is for my three yr old. Too spicy I think). Great recipe. Next time, I'll add more chicken but I think I'll add it already cooked when I throw in the shrimp. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Family really liked this. We didn't even need the rice! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This was a big hit. Spiced just right. My husband added more hot sauce at the table, but this is great as is. It is definately a new family favorite. I'm going to invite friends over just so we can share this! 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Next time I would add more chicken (I used three chicken breast) and less sausage. Everything else was great!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Yes I will make this for my family again. I would add a little more hot sauce. It's a keeper. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Made this for dinner. Family loved it. Will make again. Will probably and a little more hot sauce.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I left out the celery and only put 1/2 of the cayenne pepper in, which was just enough heat. Overall, it had an excellent flavor!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#i used chicken thighs instead of breasts we like them better and mango chipotle sausage have a nice kick in this jambalaya i did in the crock pot as well and did it for longer so next time i will add the peppers at a later time. added the shrimp the last 15 min and boy they were perfect served with corn bread and a salad.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I have made this many times for just my family, or tripled for a crowd. Always gets rave reviews, easy to adjust for taste and heat. This is easy to make, healthy and filling!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I've made this many times and even made it for a party. I used kielbasa sausage and had the shrimp to add on the side. I loved that the veggies were still crunchy and sometimes the times on slow cooker recipes are too long and the food is cooked too much. This one is right.Thanks. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Awesome recipe! I actually added 1 teaspoon extra of pepper sauce, just because I love spicy food! Served on rice and with cornbread and this was a great meal!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#delishus!! i loved it but i didnt add in peppers or anything spicy.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#1#Served with sweet cornbread this is one of my family's favorite dishes. I use red peppers instead of green and increase the cayenne pepper and hot pepper sauce to give it more heat. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Everyone loved it!! Quick,easy, satisfying. What more can you ask for?
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#THIS WAS SO GOOD AND EASY I DID IT ON THE STOVE SIMMERED 1HR. 50 MINS. AND USED ITILIAN SPICY SAUSAGE. LOOKED AT A LOT OF RECIPES I'M GLAD I USED THIS ONE. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#My husband LOVES this dish!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Excellent flavor and a huge plus for being a one-pot-fix-it forget it type of meal.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Definitely will make again, followed recipe with exception of adding hot pepper flakes instead of cayenne. Really liked the hint of smoked flavor off the sausages.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I made this for dinner last night as I am always looking for dishes to serve over rice and it was a HUGE hit! My husband LOVED it - he kept going back for more. When I suggested omitting the shrimp next time he told me it was perfect the way it was! He liked that this had a lot of flavor with just enough heat. Definitely a keeper!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Made it exactly as listed, but no shrimp. The flavor was wonderful, and my husband thought so too! We agreed that with all that wonderful flavor, the shrimp would be overpowered, anyway. My husband doesn't like rice and ate it like a bowl of stew! Will definitely make it again. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Made it exactly as listed, but no shrimp. The flavor was wonderful, and my husband thought so too! We agreed that with all that wonderful flavor, the shrimp would be overpowered, anyway. Could do with just the 1 tsp. of salt and not the extra 1/4 tsp. My husband doesn't like rice and ate it like a bowl of stew! Will definitely make it again. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#We loved it! I am going to make it Monday for a group dinner meeting. My only modification was to reduce the heat for myself; I put the hot sauce on the table. The flavor was wonderful! Thanks!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Made this last night and everyone loved it..my husband went nuts....I didn't do the slowcooker but browned all necessary ingredientsand then let simmer about 45 minutes. It's now on our favorites list. lm 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I make this all the time my boys love it. It is very easy and tasty
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Excellent layers of flavor. I didn't make this in a crock pot because there wasn't time. I sauted all of the vegies in olive oil first, added the spices except I used paprika instead of cayenne because my husband has acid issues, I added 2 Tbl of Cumin and 2 Tbl crushed Bay Leaves, browned chicken and sausages, added to mix, brought to bowl in dutch oven and simmered for 45 minutes, then added the shrimp and simmered 15 more minutes. Flavors were layered and distinct. Will add this to my Chef's List and serve with confidence to my clients. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I substituted the cayenne pepper and hot sauce for Tony Cacheries and this was perfect. Kids loved it, husband loved it!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This was not spicy at all, but very flavorful. I cooked it longer and used 1 pound of shrimp.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Have made this recipe for years now ... glad to find it here on line so I can save it on here too. Family request this recipe from me all the time ... now I can forward this to them from here ... pictures and all!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I was nervous that this would be too spicy, but it was just perfect - delicious! Will definitely make again and soon!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#My Family absolutely loved this recipe!! I am getting ready to make it again!! Really tasty!!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Very good and easy to make. It tastes better the next day!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#This is a wonderful recipe. I used fire roasted tomatoes which gave a really great taste.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I make this often and it never fails. It is so easy and so delicious. It is even better the next day. Real comfort food for fall and winter. Serve with warm bread or rolls and you have a great meal.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I've made this recipe many times and even served it for a large party. I do not add shrimp, but I have them on the side. I also use kielbasa sausage. Each time I fix it everyone loves it. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Family loved it! I am making again this week, but will add a tablespoon of brown sugar to cut the acid from the tomatoes. It was quite juicy the first time I made it, so I may also try adding the cooked rice to the slow cooker when I add the shrimp. Nice recipe!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Great! So simple, we usually leave out the shrimp just to save a trip to the grocery store. Very yummy
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I tried the Jamblaya recipe for the first time!!! It was a hit!!! I shared it with 3 other familys. All the men looooved it! Try it.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#My husband loves Jambalaya and I made this one and he loves it. I will be making it again.
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Love this Jambalaya. I have a favorite recipe I've made for years. This is just as good & easier. I added the shrimp & used andouille sausage plus the chicken. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I made this without the shrimp. Wow, it is very good! I like the fact that it is a crock pot recipe, love those! I will be making this again!!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Made this yesterday we like it. Went together quickly. Very easy. Having left overs today for lunch
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I made it without the shrimp and it was very good. It's just spicy enough and really good over rice. I did cook it on high, though, b/c I thought 4 hrs on low might not be enough to cook the vegetables. At 4 hrs on high, everything was cooked but not mushy. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Just don't add the seafood. I make a great jambalaya without seafood, but I use ham instead of chicken. 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#I don't eat shrimp or shellfish. Any suggestions on a substitute for the shrimp? 
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#going to try this tomorrow. Sounds yummy
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Love this recipe! Super tasty and is great as leftovers!
Forgotten Jambalaya#0#0#Amazing
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I have made these for many people and everyone has raved about how moist and full of banana flavor they are.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This is the BEST banana muffin recipe! The muffins have a nice banana flavor and are moist. I will definitely make this recipe again.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#BEST RECIPE EVER
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I made these muffins recently and they were easy and delicious I used half Splenda and half sugar as well as the lighten Up method of using unsweetened applesauce for the oil. And following another reviewer's advice, I added cinnamon to the batter. So good! I highly recommend them. 
Basic Banana Muffins#3#0#I should've reviewed this winner years ago; it's been my go to recipe for muffins for ages now. I always add toasted walnuts or pecans plus some spices and sometimes I toss in whatever berries I have on hand. Always delicious and not a single failure with this great and simple recipe. 
Basic Banana Muffins#1#0#I love this recipe! So easy to make and delicious and the perfect solution for all those over ripe bananas I always seem to have lying around, I'll make these muffins again and again! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I added about a tbsp of honey. They were delicious. Definitely making these again!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#excellent
Basic Banana Muffins#15#8#These were delicious! I used this recipe as a base and added a tsp of cinnamon, couple dashes of nutmeg, 2 tsp ground flax/hemp/chia seed mix into dry ingredients. After filling paper liners, I added a few chocolate chips on the top of each and sprinkled with turbinado sugar before putting in oven. These were done perfectly at about 19 min. Will save to make again and again! Thank you!
Basic Banana Muffins#3#1#Tasty
Basic Banana Muffins#6#1#I tried this today. A simple recipe that worked perfectly. Absolutely delicious. Thank you for sharing.
Basic Banana Muffins#8#6#I made these today with all purpose gluten free flour (1 for 1 substitute regular AP flour), and they turned out great, too. Made an addition of chopped pecans, very tasty. Great recipe!! Thanks.
Basic Banana Muffins#4#4#I really loved these muffins ! I also added some Walnuts on top and baked them . They were so good that I had to make a second batch because my son had to take some home ! They were also so easy and quick to make !
Basic Banana Muffins#6#3#I enjoy these muffins.... I make with 8 packets of Stevia instead of sugar and I also add either sliced almonds or walnut pieces. If I'm short a banana, I grate an apple into the mix. I make 6 big muffins rather than 12. 
Basic Banana Muffins#16#13#I was tempted to use my banana bread recipe to make muffins, but I saw another reviewer did just that and was unhappy with the result. These were good, not quite what I was hoping for. I would call them one-note, but they are really two-note: sugar and banana. I think the thing that is missing is brown sugar; maybe a mix of brown and white would give these a little more depth.
Basic Banana Muffins#6#2#This is my all time favorite banana muffin recipe! They're so quick and easy to make and they come out delicious every single time. My family raves about them! They're also great to pop in the freezer for a couple of weeks. I usually defrost one for a quick and easy breakfast or snack. 
Basic Banana Muffins#3#1#This recipe is so easy and so good. You don't even take a mixer out. We all loved them!! Next time I will make a much larger batch so I will have a few to freeze. Grandkids liked them better than banana bread. 
Basic Banana Muffins#3#1#This is absolutely DELICIOUS. My family loves when I bake this recipe and I love it too! It's such a simple and delicious recipe. This is definitely a must have recipe you've gotta try. 
Basic Banana Muffins#2#4#Amazing! I made it with gluten free flour and substituted 1/4 cup apple sauce for the egg. It was super moist and delicious! Next time I will add some blueberries.
Basic Banana Muffins#1#1#This is an excellent base recipe. I've made several times and the muffins come out super moist every time. I always add a 1/3 c. of applesauce to ensure moistness and to add a bit of apple flavor to them, sometime I sprinkel cinnamon in. I've topped the muffins before cooking with semi sweet chocolate chips, and I've also added walnuts and semi chocolate chips right to the batter. Tonight I realized I had run out of vanilla and substituted honey instead. This is a great versatile recipe. Thank you so much for sharing! 
Basic Banana Muffins#1#1#These are a hit in our house and when shared with friends and kids love them. I've been making this recipe for years and they always come out perfectly, they don't dry out and keep well ( that's if we have any left after a few days) in a ziploc bag. I add chocolate chips to ours at the end before putting in muffin cases. 
Basic Banana Muffins#3#7#Add milk next time you bake these.
Basic Banana Muffins#1#0#I have a very old recipe for banana bread that I thought i could just make muffins out of. Wrong, this is my go to recipe now. So moist! I also add crushed pecans on top. Big hit especially with coffee in the morning.
Basic Banana Muffins#1#1#I always come back to these. Light texture and made with common pantry items like vegetable oil. I put nuts on the tops of these muffins right before baking and it gives a great texture. I share these with my toddler and I just eat the nutty tops myself. Win win.
Basic Banana Muffins#2#0#I had only 2 bananas so I added 1 chopped finely apple and smooshed with a fork . Every one loved them !
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#One day I ran out of butter and stumbled across the recipe and I've never made another recipe since. People devour them and always ask for the recipe. No one cam ever believe how easy they are! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I followed the recipe and I added crushed walnuts and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. the flavor was wonderful, but I am so glad I over filled or they would have been flat disks, they didn't rise at all. the muffins were very dense. 
Basic Banana Muffins#3#0#It was really easy and simple but when I made these I set a timer for 16 minutes and they're very close to burnt!! I would suggest changing the cook time to something shorter so someone else doesn't make the mistake I did!
Basic Banana Muffins#3#0#Really easy to make and very tasty! Only thing is the ingredients doesn't mention vanilla but the directions does! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I have been making these since the recipe came out in hardcover. I can't remember the year. My kids are adults now and still love it when I make these!!!!
Basic Banana Muffins#1#0#This recipe was astounding! I didn't have vanilla on-hand, but it still tasted amazing. I used a tsp of cinnamon and 1/8 of a tsp of nutmeg and it really added to the flavor. I really recommend this recipe! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#We love this recipe and use it often. I put half a cop of chocolate chips in it which my kids like!
Basic Banana Muffins#1#0#This is a great and easy to follow recipe. I had all of the ingredients on hand, which made making it even easier. I made the recipe exactly as the directions stated. The muffins were moist and delicious. They were so easy to make. My family loves them! Next time I will need to make a double batch.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This is a really good recipe but I only use a third of a cup of sugar and they taste sweet enough, especially if you have used very ripe bananas. Try adding half a cup of chopped hazelnuts too.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I made these this morning and they are DELICIOUS! I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of just 1 cup white sugar. I added a splash of cinnamon and they are fantastic! I cooked them at 350 degrees for 18 minutes, perfect timing. I didn't fill the muffin tin half way, so they were a bit smaller than typical muffins but they're a hit. (Mix the brown sugar with the egg, oil, banana and vanilla extract then add to the dry ingredients!) 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#My whole family loved this. Sometimes we put mini dark chocolate chips in as a treat too!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#1#My go-to banana muffin recipe! I throw uneaten, unpeeled bananas in the freezer, so when I am ready, I just thaw them and they are the perfect texture. My only changes for this are that I use 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugars. Mix the brown in with the eggs/bananas/oil. I do bake at 350. Perfect muffins!
Basic Banana Muffins#1#0#You might add a little cinnamon to this and while it was baking I read a review which told me to lower the temp to 350 and did this after 7 minutes of 375. They came out like out of the bakery and I am not a good baker (but am a good cook). Also spingle a little caster sugar on top before baking and you get a sparkly top. I also used only on over ripe banana.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I believe the temp in this recipe it too high. The muffins cooked too long on the bottom and was too soft in the middle. The next batch I am turning it down to 350 for 18-22 minutes.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Jean
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I made this for Mother's Day and they turned out FANTASTIC!!! They were moist, they had rich banana flavor,didn't use too much ingredients and I decided to add a bit of cinnamon for my own touch. I will definitely make these again! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These muffins are great . Such an easy Receipe to follow. Baking time of 22 mins is too much though. I could have timed it for 15 mins. But the texture is soft. Definitely making again.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#My family and I love making these muffins! We add chocolate chips! Yummmmy and super easy.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These were great and easy to make. I did add some chopped walnuts and that added a lot. Plan to make these again and again.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I didn't have veg oil so I used coconut oil same amount and 2 bananas instead of 3 it was a awesome recipe taste amazing!!!! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Delicious!! Even though I made them without vainilla, they turned out very fluffy. My friends and family loved them. Definitely making them again. Thank you very much.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These muffins are absolutely delicious! We've made dozens and dozens of them. We've added walnuts to some and dark chocolate chips to others! We've also substituted the caster sugar for Demerara....love them!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Batter looked dry so I added a half container (1/4 cup) of mixed berry applesauce. They turned out very good, nice texture.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These are great! My kids love them! We added 1 tsp. Of cinnamon because we love cinnamon in our banana muffins!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#They turned out perfect! I'm still chuckling at some of the low ratings. Evidently you have a few people still learning how to bake. Check your baking soda and flour quality?? 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I just made these during the pandemic. I have a bowl of very ripe bananas. I'm going to cut into 1/4's and freeze for smoothies. I hate to bake and most of my stuff turns out or not very well. This was an easy recipe that didn't take a lot of ingredients or brain power. They turned out exceptionally well for us. I'm definitely saving and will make again with ripe bananas! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#So I was looking for a banana muffin that required neither baking soda nor powder. This recipe called for no powder ? and I was able to substitute soda with 1 whipped egg white. I also used brown sugar and threw in some cinnamon and nutmeg. It worked out great - the muffins were perfectly moist and fluffy. Will definitely make again.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Very basic as it states. I added chocolate chips and they still turned out very dense. Won't make again
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Heavy really awful.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This is an amazing recipe. My kids say it's only missing the chocolate chips! ??
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I followed recipe to a T, have made muffins for years, but these turned out dense
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Hey Taste of Home, I love these so much and they were so easy to make i give a special thanks for this basic recipe, Thank you so much my family and i loved these so much again THANK YOU!! - Jeanine Salas
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#It didn't take long for these muffins to disappear. They are delicious made as is, but I can't wait to make the next batch adding cinnamon, nutmeg and chopped nuts to the mix. Maybe the time after that some chocolate chips..hmmmm. 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I've tried this before actually, and it works really well! Though I want to know if you could make this into one big muffin for yourself, if you don't want a lot of muffins. If you do can you make a recipe? 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Would have been 5 stars but there was no spice. Luckily I realized this before putting into cupcake holders. Added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/8 tsp of nutmeg. Perfect! These were now grandkids ready!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Eady and quick recipe but I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking Powder and 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon Also instead of 1 full cup of granulated sugar I used 1/2 cup of granulated sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and they are yummy!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Make these every few weeks, kids like to grab them on their way out the door in the morning. Best Muffin recipe I've tried.
Basic Banana Muffins#1#2#Best waffle I have ever made. I'm allergic to bananas, but overall the pancakes were worth the near death experience. They say that you can see the light when you're about to die, but, the only light i was seeing was because of the taste of the cupcakes. They were AMAZING. I almost died... 
Basic Banana Muffins#1#0#Added an entire grated zucchini to this recipe and my kids couldn't taste the difference. Now I make these at least every other week for them! 
Basic Banana Muffins#1#0#I made these today - wow!! The best muffin i have had in a long time. After reading the reviews, I thought a muffin is a muffin. What could be so wonderful about these? I was wrong! These are wonderful.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I am allergic to eggs and gluten, I made these with 1/2 the sugar, milk instead of eggs(1/3) cup , and used my all in one gluten free flour also added 1/2 tsp. Of baking powder because more leavening is needed with my flour, they came out perfect and my husband and I enjoyed them.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Very good muffin. I will definitely make these again.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I use whole wheat flour, sometimes 4 bananas and 1 cup of maple syrup instead of sugar. Love the simplicity and kids love them.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These are the best muffins ever. Will make again.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Very good and easy.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Very easy recipe and quick. Added some milk and they came out perfectly..
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#it is an amazing muffin my kids loved it
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Quick, easy and delicious. I added some peanut butter and milk chocolate chips.
Basic Banana Muffins#1#0#This recipe was super easy to follow and turned out great! I look forward to trying more recipes. Thanks for giving me a taste of memories.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I was looking for a good, basic banana muffin recipe and this one fit the bill! So simple to make and just delicious. I threw some butterscotch chips into the batter because I needed to use them up. Next time I might try adding some peanut butter chips, although chips are not necessary since the muffins stand on their own. They're moist and delicious with lots of banana flavor. I did sprinkle some turbinado sugar on top of each muffin before baking. This recipe is perfect for getting kids involved in the kitchen too. I'll definitely keep this recipe handy! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These are delicious and so easy. Like others I like nuts so I added toasted walnuts. Definitely a keeper!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Saw this recipe yesterday and thought they sounded good. My 23-year-old son grabbed one this morning, and declared them to be the best muffins he's ever had, and he's not a muffin fan - then grabbed two more. Hubby loved them, and even though I'm not a banana fan, I thought they were really good, too. 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Loved this recipe it was so easy to make .I shared it with many of my friends in T
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I read the commnents before making this so used 3/4 cups of sugar (I do have a sweet tooth) and added about 1/3 cup chopped walnuts. This is an easy and delicious recipe.
Basic Banana Muffins#1#0#i have been dying to try out making banana bread so when i woke up to overripe bananas on Monday i asked my helper not to throw them away coz i want to bake with them. my daughter overheard us and said mama please make cupcakes and not bread since you don't have bread tin, lol. so i came to google and found this recipe. with my little baking experience and the reviews here i used half cup sugar and they were a hit and soooo moist. the family murdered them so fast they begged me to make more. because i was trying out the recipe i stuck to measurements, except for the sugar of course, but on the weekend i'm going to double it to make 2 dozen. thank you for a simple, fail proof recipe. 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These muffins are moist but WAY too sweet. Other recipes I used require less sugar and no vanilla. I tried this anyway and it's more like a cupcake than muffin.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These are excellent muffins and very easy to make. I used my large muffin tin instead of the small and got 6 delicious muffins. I know it's a winner if my husband likes them. Definitely a do over. 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These muffins are delicious. Very easy to make. This is d definitely a keeper. I will make these again.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I made this recipe for a friend who recently moved house warming gift. So simple and easy. I used frozen ripe bananas. They browned beautifully.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This is a great muffin! My picky granddaughter loved them. I did add a little Vietnamese cinnamon to the recipe. It's certainly a keeper recipe. 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Yum! Super easy and tasty. I added cinnamon, which wad am excellent choice. I do not own. Stand mixer, but I enjoy the tiny chunks of banana. Very good with a honey butter spread!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Delicious muffins! This is one of the easiest banana muffin recipes I've ever tried, and it was the one with the best results. I've made my fair share of banana muffins over the years, and I think this recipe made the best muffins yet. I kept the recipe completely as written, but I did add about a half cup of chopped walnuts to the batter. I love that it called for vegetable oil instead of crisco, made it even faster to complete the recipe. I would definitely recommend this recipe. :) 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#W-O-W these are the easiest, most delicious muffins I've EVER made!! I did 4 bananas instead of 3 and added a dash of pink Himalayan salt as a final step. Use a handheld mixer to make things easier :) 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#super easy and quick. I added some nuts; everyone loved them.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These muffins we're fast, easy,and delicious! They come out perfectly-- very moist and not too dense. I added about 1cup of frozen blueberries to the batter which added to the flavor. I will definitely use this recipe again! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This recipe was quick and easy. These muffins were delicious and were gone quick. I'm making more and have already saved this for future bananas. ?? 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Such delicious muffins! I made a few changes to the recipe: I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole meal spelt flour. I cut the sugar down to half a cup and substituted with coconut sugar. My oil choice was coconut oil. I added a cup of frozen blueberries too. When in the muffin tray before baking I topped them with pepita seeds. So good, will make these again.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These are yummy! So quick and easy! Thanks for sharing!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#came out perfect!!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Light and fluffy . I added nutmeg and cinnamon..and some coconut flakes. A pinch of garam masala is nice in the top. Good. Basic. Easy recipe.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Simple and Delicious! It's a little dense, but the flavor is on point!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This is an excellent recipe!!!! After making a batch I see no reason to even try another recipe. I added walnuts and chocolate chips. They were light, moist and beyond delicious!!!!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#The best banana muffins, moist and sweet plus easy to make.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Very easy and tasty!!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This is a basic banana muffin recipe, but very easy and very good!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I've been making this recipe for months now but never rated it. These are really easy to make fast if I want to take them somewhere or if someone is coming over. I get between 14 and 16 muffins out of the single recipe. My muffin tins are just the standard size, not jumbo. I add 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips to my recipe and sometimes chopped pecans or walnuts. They are good just as the recipe is stated also. I like the mini chocolate chips versus the larger ones so you taste more banana. Very good recipe and a keeper! They also freeze well and I'll pop one in the microwave for myself in the morning. Yum! Thanks for sharing Lorna. 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This is a really great recipe especially for beginners. The ingredients are really simple and the directions are easy to follow. They came out great. 1 c of sugar made it super sweet so I'll put in less next time.*I didn't have baking soda at the time so I used 3 tsp. of baking powder as others suggested 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Great recipe! Half cup sugar is good and plenty, especially if the bananas are ripe and sweet. I substituted a quarter cup of oats for some of the flour.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Love this recipe. Great way to use up over ripe bananas that no one will eat!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I have just made these and they were perfect in every way! Trying to cut down on sugar so I only put in half a cup. Instead of 3 bananas, I put in 2 and added a small box of sultanas and a pear diced into small pieces then sprinkled some sunflower seeds on the top. They were beautiful and definitely sweet enough.....even for me!! Thanks so much for sharing :)
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Perfect recipe. The first time I added 1 cup dried cranberries because I love cranberries. Second time I added cranberries and chopped walnuts. The muffins came out perfect. Finally, I found a really, really moist muffin recipe. Love the texture.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Seriously good and easy! I did this all in one bowl and they came out perfect. Now I wish I had doubled the recipe!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#The whole family loved these muffins! I added a few mini chocolate chips to them all and then added chopped walnuts to half. Baked them in mini muffin tins for about 13 minutes.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Fantastic and simple recipe! Loved it! I added a few tablespoons of jam I needed to use up from the fridge, and I loved the added depth of flavor.
Basic Banana Muffins#1#0#I love this recipe. I squish my bananas in a big zip lock bag and then I add the rest of the ingredients (liquids first) to the same bag, squish it up real good and then just snip the bag corner to easily fill my muffin tins. Sooo easy!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Excellent muffins! Definitely a keeper!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Wow were these good! Really moist and filling with the oats. Definitely a keeper!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This recipe was great! I cut the sugar in half and it was still a hit in our house. This will be my new go to for banana muffins!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These are by far the best banana muffins! I added about a 1/3 cup of cinnamon applesauce & they came out extremely moist. I filled the muffin tins over half full & it made 23 muffins. Even after 2 days in the fridge they are still moist as ever. Very easy & definitely a hit with the family. This is my new go to recipe for ripe bananas! Enjoy
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This is my favorite banana muffin recipe because I don't have to deal with shortening or butter! I do add about 1 T of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and accidentally added a second egg --- the muffins were super moist. I only needed about 17 minutes of baking and they were pretty dark on the outside (still looked good but not that golden color). That could just mean my oven isn't accurate (entirely possible). 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This recipe is a keeper. I printed it off to add to my recipe collection. My bananas were very large so I used 2 1/2. I added about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips. I also topped some with raw sugar and the rest I sprinkled on large sugar crystals that i use to top cookies. I liked the crunch that the sugar gave to the muffins. Muffins do take the full baking time and then I baked a couple of minutes more. I got 18 muffins from the recipe. 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These are simple to make, and tasty for a treat or quick breakfast. What I like most about this recipe is how easy it is to jazz up. I add chopped walnuts, or chocolate chips to it, sometimes a dash of almond extract instead of vanilla. This is my go-to recipe to use up ripened bananas. It's quick and my family scarfs them down in no time. 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This was a huge hit at my office, just as the previous reviewer said. In the recipe I usually make, it has use a slightly different ratio of flour and sugar (2 c flour and 1/2 sugar) so it's the same volume of dry ingredients but the first time I made this recipe I followed it as written. I thought it would be too sweet with double sugar I'm used to tasting and three sweet, ripe bananas but it wasn't too sweet at all. In fact, the person in my office who usually is most concerned with sugar content raved about these and with good reason too because they are delicious! If you want to reduce the sugar by up to half the called for amount, they are still yummy, but just remember to compensate by adding flour equal to the reduction in sugar. Personally, I'm fine with 1 c sugar. The only variations I use are to sprinkle the top of each muffin with about 1/8th tsp of raw unwashed sugar before baking because the big crystals bake a nice caramelized sugar crunch to the muffin tops. I also preheat the oven 100 degrees higher than baking temp then when I put the muffins in, drop the temp to the correct temp. I found these indeed take the full 18 min or so even with the high preheat temp. Supposedly, the high preheat temp makes them crown higher without over baking them. As a side note, parchment paper cupcake liners work the best if you have them. Thanks for reading my long review. Again, killer recipe! I've made it several times now with great results each time. Thank you so much for a great addition to my muffin rotation! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Super easy to make. I took them to work and they were a hit!! Devoured in less than 2 hours. I will definitely make again. I added a little milk and decreased the oil to 1/4 cup. Thank you for my new muffin recipe.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#My family loves these muffins -- instead of 1 cup sugar, I always use 1/2 cup white and 1/2 brown sugar, also add some chopped pecans....yummy.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Very good and easy to make. I used Splenda Blend sugar and omitted the vanilla because I didn't know that I didn't have any until I went to add it. Mine baked in 16 minutes and made 11 muffins. They are so good and moist. We ate them warm and cold and loved them. 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These are so easy & good! My whole family loved them. I used 4 bananas to get more of a banana flavor.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I have been making these for my youngest daughter since she was 2 and at 15, she still asks for them any time she sees that we have old bananas. I added cinnamon and usually use 4 bananas which makes a bit more than 12 dozen. @silkiepearls, blueberries are excellent in it! I make her dozen and then I add blueberries to the rest for mine. I put how ever many I am in the mood for, and always use frozen.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I love this recipe. So easy to make and ingredients are very basic. Kids at home love it too. You can make these even when in a bit of a rush. Thanks!!!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These muffins are spectacular. They are really good. I've tried several recipes, and none came out as moist and flavorful as these. As one other reviewer suggested, I did half a cup of granulated sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I also used half whole wheat flour and half white flour. Also just barely mix it until the wet folds into the dry. 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#So delicious and so easy! This is now my go-to recipe for using up old bananas!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Just love this receipe! Dont over stir, stir just untilmoistened. Question Tab1922 said they used blueberries. anybodyelse use blueberries too? If so, about how many blueberriesdid you use and think frozen blueberries would be ok??Thanks everyone for you help with this.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These were simple to make and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These are easy and delicious muffins! I love muffin recipes that I don't have to cream any butter/margarine. I did follow some other reader's suggestions to change the 1 cup of sugar to 1/2 cup white and 1/4 cup brown sugar; I also added 1/2 - 3/4 c chocolate chips and for half the batch, I added some walnuts. They are SUPER moist and taste great the next day, too! My entire family loves them! No more banana bread for me with my over-ripe bananas - this is my new go-to! My kids love to bring them to snack time at school! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Baked them for a board meeting. Got rave reviews!

Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These were delicious! The bananas I used were very small. I added about 1/4 c of unsweetened applesauce just in case I didn't have enough moisture. I loved the sweet crust that formed on top of the muffins. I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar. Our new favorite! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Easy and wonderful flavor!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These were so easy, and so delicious. I added a few chocolate chips in the middle of each muffin, chopped a half cut of pecans into the flour mixture along with few teaspoons of flaxseed. Great way to use ripe bananas and treat the family! Wish I could add a photo!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Easy to whip up in a few minutes in the morning and delicious. I made a glaze to drizzle over with confectioner's sugar and milk. I would definitely try this with pecans or walnuts next time. 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Quick & Delicious! I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup brown and they came out perfectly sweet enough. Even a little less would have been fine. I baked these in mini muffin tins for 11 min.

Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This recipe will become a regular! I whipped them up this morning for Sunday brunch and what a hit! I did as one other baker did and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. They were delicious!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Amazing! I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Wow, these are great. I only had two ripe bananas, so added about 1/2 c of mashed strawberries. Also added a good sprinkle of cinnamon and approx 1/2 c chopped walnuts (didn't measure). They disappeared fast. Next time will try with half whole wheat flour. My new go-to recipe. 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#The best banana muffins ever! I froze overripe bananas first (to save them from going bad) and barely mixed the batter. How can I send a picture?
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I had some ripe bananas to use and found this easy recipe. These muffins were delicious! After reading the reviews, I added some chopped walnuts, cinnamon, and nutmeg. We loved them! Next time I'll try the chocolate chips. 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I have tossed my old banana-nut bread recipe! These muffins are moist and tasty, and easy to make. The muffins are even better the next morning. You won't have to worry about leftovers. I am going to try making a whole batch (I made 1/2 batch since it's just the two of us) and freezing part of them to have handy. 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Delicious! Added a bit of cinnamon and just a dash of nutmeg, good banana flavor and excellent muffin consistency.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#So moist and delicious. Super simple with ingredients I always have on hand. My new go to muffin recipe!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Very tasty, moist and easy to make.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Yum! Super quick and easy. Made a double batch and added 1 cup of white chocolate chips.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#best banana muffins I've ever made and tasted!! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I just made these muffins. The only two changes I made was that I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour and I added a mixture of chocolate chips and peanut butter chips to the batter. These are so moist and delicious. Thanks for the recipe.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#We loved this recipe. I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup. It was sweet from the ripe bananas. I used 1 1/2 cups self rising flour instead of all purpose (with self rising flour no additional salt needed). I reduced the baking soda to 1/2 tsp. We loved the taste of 1 tsp. cinnamon & 1/4 cup nuts to make them really special.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#My family loved these easy to make muffins !
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These are the best muffins we've ever had! :) They're very moist and delicious. We especially enjoyed adding chocolate chips to ours...yummy! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Moist, delicious, easy, A+++!!! A keeper!!!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This recipe makes a great banana muffin! I replaced half the white flour with whole wheat flour and I added 2 tablespoons of poppy seeds. The muffins came out perfect.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These were so easy to make! I added chocolate chips to mine! I have started subbing in applesauce for the oil and you can't even tell. 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This is now my go-to banana muffin recipe. I sometimes add 1C of blueberries or 1C diced strawberries. I always add about 1/2C chopped walnuts or pecans. I make 18 instead of 12 muffins because of the additions and I found the original recipe to be just too much for only 12 muffins. Everybody loves these muffins. YEEEAAA!!!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These were easy to mak and very good.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Very good! :)
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Best ever! My go to muffin recipe, especially when I have extra bananas around. I have made this 1001 times. There are so many ways to tweak this, and the result is always perfect. I always decrease the oil to 1/4 cup, then add a heaping tablespoon of either vanilla yogurt, sour cream or applesauce to compensate. I also always decrease the sugar by a few tablespoons and you would never know. Sometimes I add some shredded zucchini, by decreasing an equal amount of banana. My Mom's favorite way to enjoy these was warmed in the microwave with a dab of butter. They are also good with chocolate chips mixed in, or by adding a streusel topping. 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I made this recipe just as described and the muffins turned out great! I did add 1/2 cup of walnuts, which was a great addition. I highly recommend this for its ease!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This is a very good recipe that works up quick. I did substitute unsweetened applesauce for the oil which cuts down on the fat and calories and makes it very moist and tasty. This recipe is a keeper. :)
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These muffins were moist and delicious. Very simple recipe and easy to make. I will make them again.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Love, love love this recipe!! I have been making it for over a decade, and everytime I do, my family can't wait for them to come out of the oven. Easy and delicious!!! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I have made this same recipe for at least 10 years. I got it out of my TOH magazine back then. They are easy to make and taste GREAT! A batch never lasts long around here!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Great recipe that was easy to prepare and used items that I normally have on hand. The muffins were excellent - moist and tasty. I will definitely make this recipe again...and again!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I made it tonight for my husband's snack once he comes home from work. We both love it! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Very good. Liked the flavor and how easy it was to make. Will make these more than banana bread
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I've made these muffins at least a dozen times. Easy, tasty, and my family loves them. Great way to use those last few over-ripe bananas. 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Thanks so much for a delicious banana muffin that even I could make.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Delicious, light and moist muffins! This is my family's new favorite muffin recipe, and my 5 yr old helped with every step. We made a double batch and used equal amounts mashed ripe plums (skins removed) and bananas, plus added a bit of ground ginger and cinnamon - best muffins we've ever made! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I love these muffins! to add my own twist, I placed 1/2 tsp of peanut butter in the middle for an added bonus! These are so simple to make; I have found a new use for browned bananas! Thank you!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#As a new baker, I have had a few flops, but this was delicious! I added light sour cream and it came out very moist. will definitely use this recipe again.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#These are the best banana muffins. They come out perfectly every time and they are a big hit when I bring them in to work.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Great recipe! I made as directed for the first batch & then changed it up for the second. In the second batch I substituted canned apple & raspberry pie fruit(same quantity as banana) for the banana & it worked just as perfectly.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Don't let the word'basic' confuse you. These are the best banana muffins I've ever made. I get compliments and requests for the recipe frequently. They are delicious! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Poor taste compaired to other recipes
Basic Banana Muffins#0#1#This recipe is excellent! Very easy. I have made these at least six times. The muffins are very moist and delicious. I added a fourth cup of chopped walnuts and a fourth cup of mini chocolate chips for a variation. I also added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Wonderful recipe! I used three large bananas and for one half cup of the flour used whole-wheat. I added a few mini chocolate chips and made mini muffins. 12 minutes was perfect. My three-year-old helper and I thought they were fantastic! Very easy and delicious!
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I just tried these muffins, I added 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat and then I added chocolate chips, they are great.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Yep, pretty basic.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#I reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup. These muffins keep great as a snack later in the day or for the next days lunch...if you can get them to last that long.I just throw the bananas in my mixing bowl and beat to mash, add remaining liquid ingredients and incorporate dry. Goes together so fast.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Extremely simple and absolutely delicious!Why make complicated when we can make so simple ?
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This should be called Basic, but Delicious Banana Muffins because these come out great everytime. Sometimes I add chocolate chips for an extra treat! 
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#This is the best Banana muffin recipe I have made. I like to add 1/3 cup chopped pecans.
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#Makes 7 large muffins
Basic Banana Muffins#0#0#My only concern is my will power to not eat too many. They are delicious!... and easy 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#LOVE THIS!!!!
Seafood Lasagna#1#7#Can you freeze both a cooked one (due to leftovers) and also an uncooked one? I have made it in the past. Followed the recipe and it was delicious.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Fabulous!
Seafood Lasagna#11#1#The original recipe published in the Feb/March 2002 TofH magazine calls for only 1/2 cup flour. I believe there is a typo in this online version, because 1/2 cup worked well.
Seafood Lasagna#4#2#Next time will skip the flour I read all the reviews before trying this for the first time. I agree with the review about the flour quantity. I cut it to 1/2 cup of flour but still the sauce became like spackle. I had to add an additional 1 1/2 quarts of liquid to make the sauce creamy. Next time I will try just an Alfredo sauce with butter, Parmesan and cream and maybe some white wine. Also, I added Old Bay to the seafood liquid, and subbed shallots and garlic for the green onion. Overall it was delicious. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#A family favorite.
Seafood Lasagna#15#2#Ive made this recipe many times in fact it's my husband's requested birthday meal every year . I make it just as recipe states because I believe if you adjust things you should rate a different recipe . The only ratings of THIS recipe should be BEFORE adjusting . 5 star perfect every time 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Has anyone ever done a half recipe of this before? We love seafood lasagna but we always have way too much leftover.
Seafood Lasagna#5#0#I've made this seafood lasagna recipe many many times and it has always turned out perfect every time. The creamy texture is perfect and the taste is amazing. I would strongly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves seafood and lasagna. The only change I made was I substituted the Parmesan cheese for mozzarella and lots of it .. delicious ??
Seafood Lasagna#3#4#Not a fan. 1 cup of flour created a stiff gloopy glue. Surely this must be an error? I ended up adding some extra milk, cream, chicken stock just trying to make it a little more smooth. It is extremely bland as well. I added some garlic but would suggest adding some of that old bay others have suggested. I seriously can't understand how this is award winning or how some people ended up with it being runny. After adjusting the consistency of the sauce I was able to create a lasagna. I added a little mozzarella to the top. My youngest son thought it was good but not great. Probably best for those who prefer a bit of a bland palate.
Seafood Lasagna#12#4#We love this recipe but would like to know if it can be frozen, before or after baking
Seafood Lasagna#6#1#After reading some comments and having previous experience with alfredo sauce, I added some lemon juice, a touch of Old Bay seasoning, garlic and used a shallot instead of the green onion and the sauce was absolutely delicious with those modifications.
Seafood Lasagna#1#0#This is a wonderful recipe to use. I modified it but adding some Adobo, Recaito and Sazon when preparing the onions and seafood. If you've never tried adding Spanish seasonings to recipes, give it a whirl. They give any recipe a new spin on taste! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Completely underwhelmed with the recipe as written. Not enough flavor. Only thing I did differently was add garlic while sauteing the onions. I wont be making this again.
Seafood Lasagna#1#1#Excellent! Well worth the cost of the seafood!
Seafood Lasagna#1#0#This is absolutely the best lasagna I have ever made or eaten!! Made by the recipe and the only change was the addition of some lobster and used real crab instead of imitation. Only down side is the cost of good seafood for the preparation. Maybe we'll splurge again for Christmas.
Seafood Lasagna#1#0#I added lobster meat as well. The fam LOVED it!
Seafood Lasagna#3#0#Fabulous! I added mozzarella cheese on top and within layers. Also some ricotta cheese in the middle
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Made this twice. Absolutely delicious!!!!!!! Made it today for my sister's birthday. She's never had it. Can't wait for her to taste it. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I will agree with other comentors. It is a very tasty dish but a little bit of Old Bay added a great deal to the flavor. A little dash of lime enhanced it as welland next time I will add some garlic. It just seemed to be missing something in its purist form. Be prepared because this recipe makes a lot of lasagna and it is very fattening and high in cholesterol. I cut it in half and still had a lot of leftovers. Also, I think you would be hard pressed to prepare this in 35 minutes. Plan on at least an hour. Lastly, get your credit card or checkbook out because it is not an inexpensive meal to make. Once a year on special occasions or if we are having company and want to impress. I still liked it though!
Seafood Lasagna#1#1#Well Based on some of the reviews - yes I made some changes. B/c of the changes I was able to make TWO lasagnas and I used the NO BOIL Lasagna! WIn-Win!!!I added a ricotta mix to make this dish like a lasagna. To my ricotta I like to add chili powder, egg, garlic powder, salt, fresh cilantro, and black pepper. I think the chili powder help to bring out the flavor to the whole dish b/c it is a creamy dish.I did add fresh chopped garlic when I cooked the green onions - BUT I also added and cooked 1 diced white onion tooI doubled the creamy mix b/c I used the no boil lasagna noodles and I felt the ratio of the seafood: shrimp (cut into 3 pieces if using large shrimp (1lb), scallops (1lb), and claw crab meat (1lb) would have needed the extra sauceI did not expect to make 2, but I did. One dish had 4 noodle layers and my other dish just had 3 noodle layers.I did noodle, ricotta, mozzarella and parmesean cheese layer, followed by seafood sauce. Then repeat the layers. Be sure to reserve just a cup of sauce (without the seafood) for the top last layer of the lasagna. I did top that with Mozzarella too. I didn't reserve sauce for my 2nd dish top noodle, so it was covered with the seafood. I didn't want it to burn, so that one had extra mozzarella cheese on it.Yes this is a heart attack waiting to happen, but if you are going for it, then go for it. I wouldn't make this everyday, maybe special occasions. Everyone LOVED it. I made it for a potluck. It is a little time consuming, but oh so good!!! The other dish I gave pieces away. I only wanted 2 pieces b/c I am health conscious. But no doubt with my changes it was good.I don't measure, but I used this recipe as a guideline. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I rated this a 4 because it tasted ok. However, it is missing garlic. I don't feel this is a lasagna, but a seafood Alfredo using lasagna noodles. It is seafood with an Alfredo sauce (except for the missing garlic) and lasagna noodles. 
Seafood Lasagna#1#0#ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I MADE IT INSTEAD OF MY USUAL RECIPE AND IT WAS AWESOME. WOULD MAKE A GREAT SOUP ALSO. BEST ONLINE RECIPE I HAVE EVER MADE!
Seafood Lasagna#1#0#A great lasagna recipe. I like to add thinly-sliced mushrooms as the crab, scallop, shrimp and cream sauce mixture can become a little rich without the mushrooms to balance it out. I also believe in splurging a little more on real lump crab meat as opposed to imitation crab meat as this dish is one that deserves the best.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I make this a couple of times a year, usually for a special occasion. Always a hit!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#The family loved this. Of course with everything, you put your own spin on it according to your household pallet. I only added and didn't remove anything the recipe called for. I doubled the recipe (large house of 9). I added 1 onion, old bay seasoning, red pepper flakes, frozen and squeeze drained spinach, also topped it with cheddar cheese. It was absolutely amazing! Only downfall it was pretty pricey but worth it. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#An excellent recipe! I used a bit more shrimp, as my family is not fond of scallops. Fish cubes for stock is a good subsitution for both the chicken stock and clam juice. If you do that cut back on the salt. This is a rich and satisfying meal. It looks and tastes sophisticated. Freezes well too.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Very very good... definitely making this again!
Seafood Lasagna#12#2#can this be made the night before and cooked the next day as I often do regular lasagna?
Seafood Lasagna#2#1#Fantastic!!! I expected this dish to be delicious based on the standing 5 star rating, but it was even better than I expected. Could hold it's own against any seafood lasagna I've eaten at restaurants. Agree with other comments - great for Christmas, or special occasion meals, as it is really rich and can be pricy. My recipe adaptations based on seafood avail. in KS: ~2.25 lbs. king crab legs* (not Alaskan), 2 lbs. sea scallops (since they were almost half as expensive as bay, and are more tender. Cut into smaller pieces.), 2lbs frozen wild salad shrimp (Costco). Using the fresh crab was well worth it, once I was done cracking it all - the flavor was amazing! I added 6-8 roasted garlic cloves to the sauce as well. My entire family loved this lasagna, including kids and some pickier people. I will absolutely make this again! *Actually less expensive per lb. than canned crab. I also doubled the recipe as others and so glad I did. I also used DeLallo Organic Italian Whole Wheat Lasagna (no boil) noodles which are my go to for lasagna. 
Seafood Lasagna#1#1#Oh my Goodness! This dish is absolutely FANTABULOUS!!!!! I used 1.5 pounds of shrimp (12 ounces), 1 pound (16 ounce) of REAL jumbo lump crab meat, and 1.5 pounds of bay scallops (12 ounces). I doubled everything else. I also added fresh garlic to my green onion mixture and I added the garlic just before I added the broth and juices. I used Costco's fresh, aged parmigiano reggiano cheese. My sauce was not bland at all! It was thick, rich and decadent! Also, in the doubling process, I used an 8 ounce bottle of clam juice and an 8 ounce bottle of lobster juice. Be sure to drain the seafood stock from the meat to ensure your source isn't runny. Additionally, because mine did not brown after 38 minutes of baking, I put it under the broiler for about 2 minutes. It was perfect! While the seafood makes the dish costly, it was well worth it! I will certainly be making it again! 
Seafood Lasagna#2#0#I made this for Christmas dinner. It was a huge hit and my daughter requested it for her birthday dinner. I used canned crabmeat instead of the imitation stuff. Even though it was finely shredded it worked extremely well and actually gave some body to the sauce. I also used just a little extra shrimp, scallops and crabmeat. It was fantastic and will be a go-to for special dinners!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#If you love seafood, this is a real hit! I made it for the first time last night and shared with friends. Everyone loved it! I did use real crab meat. I'll be sure to drain the pot with seafood better next time, as the sauce was just a bit runny, but it was still delicious. I also used whole wheat lasagna. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I have to join the other 5 star raters with this one. Its very rich and wonderful. Impressive and very satisfying. I did use a few suggestions. I feel that this recipe will do just fine with just 2 seafood choices. If Crab is one of them Use fresh. Next time I will just use shrimp & Crab. I also reduced the clam juice and used a dry sherry.This recipe will serve quite a few so I downsized it to just 2.I also feel that this would be perfect for stuffing pasta shells * Next time for sure.JanieTaste of Home Volunteer Food Editor.
Seafood Lasagna#0#1#Oh my my my this was soooooo good all I changed was I used regular onions and spenich h and it was so good I will make this again sooner than later
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This is the bomb, when I take it out to potluck it is the first dish emptied. Everyone asks for the recipe.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Delicious! My sauce was a little bit runny after it baked. I'll be sure to thicken it a bit more next time. But this recipe is definitely a keeper! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#My family thought this was the best dish ever! There were no leftovers and I think if I'd doubled it, they would have still eaten all of it! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Time consuming to make slightly expensive to afford, but Oooh sooo good. Every time I make this. I have to double the recipe. Can be frozen and baked later. Does not seem to effect the taste or texture. I love that it is 100 % from scratch. To who ever come up with this recipe Well Done . 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This is the best....a real family favorite. If you love seafood and pasta you'll love this! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Best seafood lasagna I've made to date in all categories - taste, texture, and presentation. Relatively easy, felt good going together. I substituted 1/2 lb of fresh crabmeat for the imitation crab. My foodie dinner guests thought it was one of the best they have ever tasted. Note that it is very rich and easily serves 12. When making for just ourselves, I think I'll cut this into 15 pieces. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#J'Adore! La Vie d'Amour. A very sensual lasagna for a Valentine's Evening!! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I am preparing this to night for the 2015 Super Bowl - Patriots Fan. Serving this tomorrow with Chili - Home made sausage, onions and peppers and your delicious Seafood Lasagna - Will keep you posted - Go PATRIOTS!!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Wow... Just wow. A sinfully rich and creamy big occasion lasagna for sure. I made no changes except to omit green onions, use my own favoured combo of seafood (shrimp, squid and snapper fish) and to make extra of the white sauce as advised by a lot of reviewers. Served this at a late night Christmas eve gathering and the whole thing was polished off in minutes ! And everyone raved about how good it was. I am especially pleased at how flavourful the white sauce was and the seafood wasn't overcooked at all because of the double cooking process (seafood is boiled then baked). Yummm!!! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#DE' !!! LICIOUS. Made for christmas 2014, used real crab meat. Very, very good!!!!!. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I made this recipe a few times for guest, everyone loves it. Very rich but well worth it.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#A truly amazing, rich, lasagna. Mmmmm good.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Love this lasagna!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Delicious with lobster meat instead of crab !!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Very good recipe. I had made it on Christmas Day. Used real crab meat. It is one of those special occasion recipes.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This is a truly delicious lasagna. The leftovers taste amazing too. I will definitely make this again. Next time I won't precook the seafood. The shrimps were slightly overcooked in mine. Still, I can't complain. This recipe is a keeper! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Don't try this on kids' activity night! This dish is time-consuming but oh-so worth it! Imitation crabmeat???? I don't think so! I use 3, 6-oz. cans lump crabmeat. I also use half & half instead of whipping cream, which is what I do for all recipes calling for whipping cream. Other than those 2 changes (minor), the recipe is excellent as written. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I made this for Father's Day! It was delicious. It had the perfect combination of seafood. I used real crab meat. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Its is a very good recipe. However, I find using too much real crab meat will give it an overwhelming taste. That's most likely why they suggest imitation crab meat. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This was sooo good! I made it using frozen shrimp and scallops, both defrosted. Wonderful taste. Rich and creamy. Will definitely make it again.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Being a Creole girl from New Orleans, LA., I simple love seafood. I tried this dish but I used real lump crab meat, added the holy trinity (onion, bell pepper and celery), added white cooking wine to the sauce and added a dash of Old Bay seasoning. Chile' my husband still licking his fingers. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#1#Yum!!! Added a tablespoon of brandy to the white sauce and it really brought out the flavor and creaminess. I've also made this where I mixed the white sauce and seafood mix and then poured it into a 9x13 over cheese ravioli - cooked at 350 until bubbly. One of my family's favorites! 
Seafood Lasagna#1#0#Hi phillips66: I recently moved and, in the process, lost my treasured copy of Gourmet Magazine with the Seafood Lasagna recipe you refer to above.   I remember there was whitefish in the recipe and the wine was reduced along with bones acquired from the fishmonger.  I wondered if you still have that recipe. I would love to get it back.  Thank you.  jb
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#My husband couldn't stop raving about this dish. I used fresh crab, but everything else was the same. It was work intensive but will make again for a special occasion or large gathering. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I also did some minor changes as I did not have the scallops on hand. I used twice the imitation crab, used 2 cans of crab meat drained. And medium sized tail on shrimp, It was work intensive but it turned out amazing, I will make this again and again!!!!! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This recipe was okay the first time I made it except for the imitation crab meat and the lack of seasoning. The second time I made it I made some changes. I used real crab meat, twice as much as the recipe calls for. I also poached some fresh caught fish, and deboned them and added the fish meat to the recipe. I did not use scallops because I didn't have any. I live on the water and have access to fresh fish, shrimp and crabs so that is what I used. I also added a little garlic and some Cajun seasoning. I doubled the sauce recipe and used a lot more cheese. The second time I made it, it turned out better. I will give the original recipe a three star rating and the recipe after my few changes still just three stars. And , No, I will not make it again. It serms like something is missing. I think it's the ricotta cheese that my seafood lasagna recipe calls for. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I served this recipe with a few changes (lobster instead of crab, added mushrooms, tried to keep down the calories by using 2% milk instead of the whipping cream, & all chicken broth instead of clam juice) to a discerning group of ladies with compliments all around the table. I plan to make this sauce & serve it over pasta or rice next time. The rice should nicely sop it up . 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Made this for my husband for our anniversary. It was absolutely delicious! Definitely will make again. :)
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I made this for Christmas, everyone loved it. Next time, I will double the sauce.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#One of my all-time favorites. I use sea scallops, large shrimp and real crab meat. Double the sauce to accompany the larger quantities of seafood used. I also add a good shake of white wine while making the sauce. Learned that one from Gourmet Magazine, many years ago. It is a holiday/special occasion recipe for my company. Always a stellar hit!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Amend the recipe to include real crabmeat and then add another star to the rating system and we have a winner with my family! A little pricey, because I have to double my recipe for my family, but worth every penny and is still less than the seafood dinners and more portions and better quality than dining out!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I've made this a number of times. L cut the shrimp up to the size of the scallops. I do it in Pyrex so it can go out right in the dish. Everyone loves it. Nice salad, white wine and crusty bread. Great! Janet 
Seafood Lasagna#1#0#Why would anyone use imitation crabmeat in a wonderful dish like this? Spend a couple more dollars and get the real thing. It is so much more flavorful.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This was delicious! I substituted gluten free lasagna noodles and an almond based flour and used real crabmeat. Fantastic! It was a huge hit at my dinner party, and our gluten intolerant friend appreciated it.
Seafood Lasagna#1#0#The only change I made was to use real crabmeat...perfect!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I make this every Christmas. Everyone loves it! I find that I use much less of the sauce because it comes out thicker and less soupy. I all so use big scallops, big shrimp and real crabmeat. It truly is a special meal
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This is the best...me and my daughter made it for a girls night and it was a big hit. All my friends enjoyed, one even asked for the recipe. There was no leftovers. I did make one alteration, like a few others, I doubled the chicken broth and only used half the clam juice. The wine recomendation helped also. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Delicious, this was a hit with my family. The only substitute I used was good crab instead of imitation. A bit of work but so well worth it!!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I made this at home and liked it so much that I made this for our local volunteer fire company's annual banquet. We served 200 people. We made it the day before and cooked it the next day. It was so good. I received many request for the recipe. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This was a bit of work to make, but well worth it. Scallops are pretty expensive where I live, and the recipe is short on veggies, so I used a 12oz frozen bag of Bird's Eye Marsala mix (mushrooms, onions and garlic) in place of them. It was perfect. My family was scrapping the sauce from their plates with their forks. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#A good friend made this lasagna & it's been on my mind since then! It is DELICIOUS! I asked her for the recipe & she sent it (from this website). This lasagna was just delicious. I'd never had a seafood lasagna and it was any & everything I could imagine...seasoned well (she made a few changes to the recipe)! I will be making this delightful dish soon & for company & holidays. :0) 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I have made this recipe a few times. This is one of my favorites. I have also shared it with friends and passed the recipe along also. I do make it with lobster though, instead of crab.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Just finished eating my first attempt at this recipe and it was great! Did make a couple of changes....added 4 chopped onions and one clove of minced garlic. Didn't have clam juice so used 1/2 of clamato juice and increased chicken broth to 1 cup. We are looking forward to leftover tomorrow! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This recipe was off the charts!! Six years ago, my husband and I were in Venice and ate at The Black Cat Restaurant In Burano. He had a seafood lasagna and has been asking me to make it since. I finally found this recipe and made it yesterday (Father's Day.) Well--he flipped! It was sooo delicious! Told me that it is his favorite dish ever!! Asked me to make it again for his birthday in September. Thank you so much for this recipe. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Delicious. I had to double the recipe because I have 4 kids but still tasted great.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I was looking for a quick and tasty recipe for our housewarming dinner (5 adults, 2 kids). Can I just say that this recipe was amazing. Not a labour of love like other lasagna recipes. There was plenty for everyone including left overs. I will definitely make this again.I use another reviewers suggestion: double the chicken broth and half the clam juice, and 4 spring onions, and black pepper instead of white (didn't have any). I also added a tablespoon of lemon juice to the seafood. Very nice recipe. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This was phenomenal! I would certainly make this again. I followed the recipe and had nothing but compliments:)
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This was very yummy. The only change made to the recipe was 1 cup of chicken broth & 1/2 cup of clam juice because other commented about the fishy taste. Also more seasoning to taste that noted.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I made this last night and my guests couldn't get enough of it and asked for the recipe. Six of us ate the whole plan! I served it with a salad and herbed bread. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. The sauce was creamy and smooth. I found out that bay scallops (the small ones) are sweeter than the big scallops (which tend to be tasteless). I made it in the morning and cooked it at night. Next time I'll try making it the night before just because I like to do as much as possible beforehand. It was easy to make. My husband can't wait for me to make it again. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Awesome!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I cut this recipe in half, mostly, to fit in an 8 x8 square Pyrex pan. Used a 12-oz. bag of frozen shrimp, half a pound of bay scallops, and 8 oz. of Lobster Delights (some sort of surimi). Flavored the cream sauce with a couple tablespoons of dry white wine. Served with garlic bread and a green salad with raspberry vinaigrette. Quite excellent! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I made for dinner last night. Amazing and simple to make.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#very tasty !!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I have made this many times and had rave reviews. Have even baked ahead and froze. Still was excellent! If you don't want to spend the money for scallops you can use more shrimp/imitationcrab. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Tastes great! I used real clam, not imitation. It did take quite some time to prepare but was worth it.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This recipe was horrible! I cannot understand how so many reviewers rated it so high. I will definitely NOT be making this again.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I made this for Christmas dinner based on the reviews submitted and ended up having to throw the entire casserole out after tasting it! It was gross...very fishy and bland. The clam juice and crabmeat were overpowering (I used backfin). I can't imagine anyone enjoying this recipe. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#turned out great!! Easy and tasty. Thanks for sharing.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This was a bit time consuming...but well worth it. It is very rich so you won't eat much but it is just as good re-warmed for another meal.I have made this recipe several times and will make it many times more. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#every year this is my husbands no matter who shows up it's gone and everyone raves about it! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#agree with most of the reviews- definitely an excellent recipe. used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream- still very rich and creamy. also, used the clam juice from a can of chopped clams, and used the clams instead of the crabmeat. added some minced garlic, extra green onion, and extra parmesan cheese. looking forward to the leftovers!
Seafood Lasagna#2#0#This is one of the best Lasagna's I've ever eatened.Re: To Summy, the one thing about you - you're consistent, your consistantly giving bad reviews. You said it was too rich and had to throw away? I don't believe you threw something this expensive away. Next time give it to the poor or someone that needs it. If you read the recipe before making it you would of know with cream, etc.. was going to be on the rich side. Or like other veiwers, they knew to modify it to their liking. Please grow up and reconsider making bad reviews before publishing them. Were tired of reading them, thank you! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Love it, I knew you will love this.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Thick creamy sauce. Not overly fishy. Great texture. An excellent recipe. EXCELLENT!!!!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This is a wonderful dish to make for a dinner with friends. Everyone has raved about it when I have served it.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This recipe is to die for! I made it twice in one week. The second time I made it for a big family get together, and everyone was asking me for the recipe. I used sea scallops and real crab meat, so it can be pretty pricey to make, but it is worth every single penny! DELICIOUS!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I have made this recipe numerous times since first discovering it last year. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used coconut oil in place of oil and butter. I also used half and half in place of the heavy cream. I use shrimp, scallops and real crab meat (living in Maryland this is a must!). The recipe is rich but bursting with flavor and is oh so yummy. My husband, our 12 year old and our 7 y.o. LOVE this. My parents in law and siblings love it as well. If you are seafood lovers, this won't serve 12, maybe 8. I highly recommend this... Great!!! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I had made this for my sons birthday party (during lent),and I had people ask for the recipe.I will be making this again and am so looking forward to it.It is creamy, rich and tastes like something you would get in an expensive restaurant.If your looking for something to serve to guests...this is it!
Seafood Lasagna#0#1#I didn't care for this one either. As another reviewer noted, it's VERY rich. And, I love seafood, too. I ended up throwing it out. :( 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I just didn't like this one:( Too rich and too seafoody, and I love seafood! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#We love this recipe and it's become the birthday dinner choice for my daughter year after year. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Made this last night and it was so delicious. Very rich, (butter and cream) will be looking to try and modify to make a tad more light -- I also neglected to pay attention to how much it made--so I had a lot left over for a family of 4 with 2 small children...looking forward to enjoying the leftovers! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Made this for a dinner party of 6 and everyone loved it. Will make it again!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This is absolutely delicious, however, no way does it serve 12. We had 6 for dinner and have enough for one person to have leftovers. It is not as high as it shows in the picture. Three layers is just not that high. I didn't add the fake crab and don't think it was missed. I will definitely make it again and pass on the recipe. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#My husband and I loved this dinner! Very easy to make. It is definitely a recipe that will be going into my recipe box as only the best go in there. :)
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I've been making this recipe for years but we like it best as seafood enchiladas,I make it as the recipe says then take the seafood out of the sauce put in flour tortillas top with a little shredded mozz. cheese roll up and top with the sauce and shredded parmesan bake in 325 oven til sauce is hot and cheese is melted 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#The family really like this one!
Seafood Lasagna#1#0#I have made this recipe quite a few times and every time is a success.Everybody loves it.As a side note: I also add lobster meat, usually an 8oz package.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Made this for the second time for my daughter and her family...they loved it!Very good! Will make again for sure.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#We thought this was really good! Going to make it for my daughter and son in law....very good!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#BEST DINNER EVER!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Incredible! My husband complained that I don't cook for him the same fancy meals I used to and was hoping this would redeem myself! It sure did! I added spinach as suggested by another user, and also a touch of fresh dill (personal preference), and it was just right! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This was an excellent recipe!! This recipe is now my husbands favorite. It was easy to make, but it did take me a little longer than 35 min. to make it. It was worth it though, because it was absolutely delicious. I am going to make this when I have my next dinner party. This is definitely a keeper.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This is a well put together recipe. I followed it to the letter and I did find the sauce a bit too pasty (maybe less flour next time) and bland. It needs more seasoning. Only salt and pepper was called for in the recipe, but I would definitely experiment with other spices as well and up the green onions from 1 to like 4.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good. I think the next time I make it I will use a linguine noodle instead.
Seafood Lasagna#1#0#This is the first time I have rated a recipe. That's how awesome this seafood lasagna was. People are asking me for the recipe. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This is the best seafood lasagna that I have ever had, my family loved it! I did add a small amount of garlic powder for a bit more flavor, other than that I followed the recipe as written. Can't wait to make it again! Next time,I might try to lighten it up a bit. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#what good timing - I was just about to search for this -- My ds has requested it again this year for his birthday dinner.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Oh, wow! I made this just as something to look forward to on a weeknight - because I was tired of the winter blahs. My whole family loved this and I was told to put it in my special favorites book. Thanks so much for sharing! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I made some adjustments, the most important I thought were to make a seafood stock from the shrimp shells to use in lieu of the chicken stock, I use crabmeat rather than sealegs, I prefer the more delicate taste of shallots and 1/3 cup of sherry adds a wonderful depth of flavor to the sauce.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Made this for hubby and me today and we really like it! Ingredients are quite spendy and it is also not a low cal meal. I think it would be a very elegant dish for special occasions with friends and family-a lot for two to eat. I wonder how well it will keep and reheat.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Delicious! Added 1 pkg of frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Sometimes I ajust recipies to my liking. Not this one. I make this for special occasions. My husband loves seafood lasagna. I make it every Valentines day, but anytimes would be good.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I made this for my family for Valentines Day, very yummy, and even better the next day. Even my picky son ate 2 helpings. I'll use real crabmeat next time though 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#AMAZING...This was soo sinfully good..I made if from my hubby for Valentines day we are hooked!!!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I've made this a few times for large groups, and always get raves on it. I substitute coconut oil for the butter and oil. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I first made this in 2002 and have made it for Christmas every year since as a special meal request from my sons. When I host Christmas for my co-workers it is requested also. It is a treasured recipe and I am so glad that I tried it!!!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#OMG - fantastic!!!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#So good! Packed with yummy seafood- its creamy and good. How could you go wrong here?
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This is a keeper. My husband just loved it. I did use skim milk and smart balance and it was excellent.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Everyone loved this recipe. I topped with mozzarella too. Yummy:)
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Very smooth and the taste is great! This is my second time making it very good.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Made this for Christmas dinner...don't let it fool you that it takes 35 minutes to assemble. This by far is the best seafood lasagna recipe. I subbed imitation lobster for the crabmeat because I had it. I also used no cook noodles for time saving. I suggest putting 4 noodles across making a total of 12. 
Seafood Lasagna#1#0#tried this recipe for Christmas Dinner. I did make a few modifications. I used 1 pound of Maine lobster meat, 1 lb of sea scallops (cut in quarters) and 1 lb fresh Maine shrimp. I also increased the lasgana noodles to 4 noodles abreast, for a total of 12.On a scale of 1 to 10, this meal was a 15.. My husband the red meat eater , said it would be a toss up between my notorious prime rib meal, or this new recipe. It was easy to make, and the flavor undescribable. He even mentioned he wanted to lick his plate. You will not be disappointed if you try this . 10 Stars in my book. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Yes, it can be made ahead and refrigerated makes it even better. Also, it freezes really well, also. I was afraid to freeze it, but it turns out even better. Gonna make some tonight and freeze it for Christmas Eve next week.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Rich, creamy and excellent.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#Can this be assembled ahead of time refrigerated then cooked? If so, how much time should be added to the cooking time?
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This is a wonderful recipe that I now make just for special occasions. Elena, if you have any more of your specials we would love to get them. Carol, Stuart, Fl. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#What type of imitation crabmeat is best to use? From a can, or is there a package type in refrigerated or frozen section? Also, it turned out a little runny. What do you advise?
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I make this every year for Christmas Eve and family reunion and other times throughout the year. Everyone loves it and it is easy to make.
Seafood Lasagna#1#0#I have made this so many times that I could do it blindfolded. This is the best lasagna I've ever had. My grandson will call me and ask me to make it for him everytime he comes to visit. I even have a cousin who offers to pay me to make it. LOL. This is truly the best. Thank you so much for sharing this. 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I introduced this dish to my family for our 2008 Christmas dinner. This seafood lasagna was very delicious! I appreciate that the recipe was well written. The measurements for the ingredients were perfect as were the directions. Since everyone enjoyed it I know I will be preparing this recipe again. Thank You!
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I used the no cook lasagne noodles and it worked just great. This is an excellent recipe and quite delicious.Rosie Knight - Quincy, IL
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I'll be making this for the first time, for my Fiance's family for Christmas ... wish me luck! :-) 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I first made this in 2002 and have done it at least once a year since, usually on a Holiday. You have plenty of baking to prepare the other dishes.
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I made this for company and it was delicious. My husband doesn't like scallops so I used 2 pounds of shrimp and the imitation crabmeat. I didn't let it sit for 15 minutes after i took it out of the oven, and it was really runny - I guess that's why you're supposed to let it sit, my bad. I used Smart Balance butter and fat-free half-and-half and as the other poster said, it turned out fine. I think next time I might skip doing the lasagna part - I'll just make the sauce and put it over linguine (and sprinkle the parmesan cheese over the whole thing). Definitely a keeper! 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#This is an absolutely wonderful seafood recipe. I make it whenever I want my husband to do something around the house as a bribe . I very often slim it down , however, and use skim milk in place of the cream and a no trans fat margerine in place of the butter. You would never miss the extra fat. JFS 
Seafood Lasagna#0#0#I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now. I really thought I had reviewed but I didn't see it on here so I'm reviewing it again, This is the best seafood lasagna I've ever had. I have several family members from out of town who will call and ask if I will make this for them when they come to visit. It's a little time comsuming but well worth it. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. It's definitely a jewel!!! 
Creamy Grape Salad#7#0#I've been making this salad for several years. Always a hit! Guests are disappointed if I don't serve it at our parties. 
Creamy Grape Salad#16#0#This grape salad is sumptuous! Right before I started making it, my husband informed me he didn't really like grapes! Well, once he tasted the finished recipe, he absolutely loved it! He couldn't get enough! Our grown son and I loved it also. I will be making it for the second time tomorrow, this time using red grapes, green grapes, and black grapes. Yum! 
Creamy Grape Salad#6#0#My go2 take to all friends and family get togethers. It is alway requested. This salad goes with everything.
Creamy Grape Salad#4#1#Just made this, so delicious
Creamy Grape Salad#10#3#LOVED ! I Used Green Grapes Only .
Creamy Grape Salad#2#1#This is so yummy! I used the red grapes only and it was just as good.
Creamy Grape Salad#9#4#Not exactly the healthiest salad, but oh, so delicious. I do back off the sugars a bit, because the grapes are usually super sweet. I've made this several times, and everyone seems to enjoy it. 
Creamy Grape Salad#16#7#I have been making this not as a grape salad but as a fruit dip for years! I make a double recipe (omitting the brown sugar and nuts) and refrigerate overnight with a variety of different fruits to get dip and fruits very cold before serving. I place in a pretty bowl in the center of a platter with different fruits placed all around the bowl. I use pineapple chunks(fresh or canned), strawberries, grapes, blueberries, apples, navel orange sections, etc., etc. Whatever fruit you desire! A great family gathering, party, or baby shower dish. We love this as an all fruit dip!!!!
Creamy Grape Salad#8#14#You can also add shredded cheese to the cream cheese & sour cream mixture. Thick shredded gives it texture. I'm going to try the mascarpone & Greek yogurt next time. Also someone asked why cut the grapes.... you should always cut them, they are a choking Hazzard for elderly and children. Also, out of brown sugar? Make your own. 1 cup granulated sugar 1 tbs molasses Mix, store in a zip lock baggy 
Creamy Grape Salad#8#0#I have had grape salad for the first time on my job 3 years ago. I fell in love with this dessert ever since then. I found this recipe and it's the BEST!!!!!!!!!!! Love Love Love it
Creamy Grape Salad#2#1#Great taste. Easy to make.cut the grape in half was the hard part. LOL
Creamy Grape Salad#23#3#Someone asked'Is there a complimentary ingredient you could add to this grape salad?' My cousin adds one large diced apple. I've eaten her version and the dressing compliments an apple of choice as well as the grapes. So delicious either way! :) 
Creamy Grape Salad#6#0#Delicious! I am a huge fan of the dressing and the grapes are just a reason to make it. ?? If I make this for a gathering, I'll add the pecans, but for just me and my husband, I can leave them off. I've already shared this with my mom! 
Creamy Grape Salad#6#2#I made this recipe after having it at work one day and this was better than what I had. It's very creamy and I didn't change anything just added more brown sugar and nuts. 10 stars for me
Creamy Grape Salad#26#9#I have been making this for years and everyone loves it! My recipe calls for 4-5 tablespoons of brown sugar and to put half in the dressing and the rest sprinkled with the nuts. The biggest thing is to dry the grapes after washing them. If they are wet, the dressing slides off. I live close by Marge also! This recipe must have been shared at all of the West Michigan gatherings!
Creamy Grape Salad#24#6#I love this salad and have made it for summer BBQ's for years. I prefer to mix the cream cheese, sugar, vanilla and sour cream and then let it set in the fridge over night. Take it out a little before my family leaves, then add the grapes to the mixture and add toppings. It seems to just give everything a chance to mesh together. I've never had a complaint, not sure what they used to make it taste like mayo but it sounds like a user error rather then a recipe fail to me 
Creamy Grape Salad#6#112#Nasty. Doesn't taste good unless you put tons of brown sugar on it. Otherwise, it tastes likes grapes with mayonnaise. Gross. My friends hated it. What a waste of money. 
Creamy Grape Salad#20#0#This Grape Salad is DELICIOUS! I used green and red grapes in this recipe, plus it added some nice color to it. This can also be made as a low fat recipe. I used fat free sour cream & cream cheese & used Splenda for sugar. 1 cup equals 1 point for Weight Watchers.
Creamy Grape Salad#5#11#The brown sugar needs to be mixed into the salad and there should be more of it. 2.3 stars
Creamy Grape Salad#12#0#This is the best! Keeps longer than sa!ads made with Cool Whip. Does not get watery. Couldn't stop eating it! 
Creamy Grape Salad#7#2#I grew up in Jenison! Hi Marge! It really is a potluck sort of town. This recipe was fantastic! Since I was making it for my family, I halved the recipe. The toasted pecans and brown sugar on top were the perfect foil for the tart grapes and cream cheese. Wow!
Creamy Grape Salad#4#0#Very good. I had no pecans on hand and used sliced almonds.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This Salvaged my small green grapes that were too tart to enjoy. I quartered them and it did not water down the dressing overnight. 
Creamy Grape Salad#11#0#I've made this many times and even people who are not especially fond of grapes love it. It's always a hit. I do, however, toast the pecans. I never liked having to heat up the oven to toast a few nuts and always found the fry pan gave me unreliable results. So now I do it in the microwave by melting a generous teaspoon of butter on a microwave safe dish and spreading 1/4 cup of chopped nuts on it. Microwave for a minute and stir. Microwave one more minute and stir. In my microwave that's all the time I need. Let cool. So easy. 
Creamy Grape Salad#2#0#Everyone loved it, even the kids. I did cut the sugar to 1/4 c. because my grapes were pretty sweet.
Creamy Grape Salad#2#0#Awesome tasting and very simple to make!
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#VERY GOOD
Creamy Grape Salad#2#0#This salad is great. The only problem is it makes a huge batch.
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#delicious, easy to prepare, great to take to potlucks
Creamy Grape Salad#3#0#I have been making this for years. I freeze 3 Milky Ways and chop in food processor for add in. This is my granddaughter's most requested recipe from her Nan's kitchen!
Creamy Grape Salad#3#0#Easy and DELICIOUS.
Creamy Grape Salad#3#0#I tasted this salad at a funeral 3 years ago. I could not get enough of it! I'm so happy to have found the exact recipe here. 
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#Delish!
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#This sweet salad drew raves at my Easter dinner...even though I forgot to add the brown sugar and pecans at the end. I add those to my leftovers and I really loved the added texture from the pecans. The recipe makes a large amount, making it perfect for a potluck. I halved the recipe for a my smaller group and still had some left for the next day.
Creamy Grape Salad#6#0#My husband's family has been using this exact recipe for years. It's deceptively good. We make it in a 9x13 pan and sprinkle the top with brown sugar and nuts. Walnuts are great here, and pecans also work really well. It's definitely a go-to potluck dish in our household. Never thought about adding chopped up candy bars, but I can see how that would be delicious! 
Creamy Grape Salad#1#7#Great idea...BUT. whole grapes are a'CHOKING' hazard ! I never serve whole ...always cut in half !! 
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#This makes a huge salad so even for family events, I half the recipe. Very good.
Creamy Grape Salad#2#0#Everybody loves this salad. It's easy and makes for a great bring something dish. I really like it sans the brown sugar and nuts. I think it's perfect all by itself, but the garnish does make it look better. I make it at night and let it sit in fridge until the next day. Make sure grapes are dry before combining. 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#1#I made this for Thanksgiving, very delicious.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#i made this for the first time just because I love grapes. My family agreed and it has become a favorite of my grandchildren as well. Cool, refreshing, different and not too sweet.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#My family loves tbis, and it is so easy to make!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This is a delicious salad and last well when refrigerated. Easy make ahead!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I saw this on Food Network yesterday. Was very impressed. I will be making it soon.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#sonya Love, love, love, this salad! ..... Have shared this recipe with family, friends, and their friends! thank you soooo much for printing this delious salad !
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I took this to a baby shower and people just raved about it. Thank goodness I doubled it, should have tripled it. So, so good. Thank you for this recipe.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This dish received rave reviews at a graduation open house. It was loved by all ages! I used the butterfinger topping and mixed some into the salad as well!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Made this recipe and cut the sugar in half. No one knew the difference and it still tasted great. Very quick and easy to put together. Family loves it.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#My family thoroughly enjoyed this tasty grape salad. It packs well for our picnics at soccer tournaments. My family often requests this salad. Thank you for sharing your recipe.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#When we moved to the south in 2012 this was the first recipe I had to have . Everyone loves it from kids to adults. It's very refreshing.
Creamy Grape Salad#3#1#Had this salad a number of years ago at a funeral. Everybody raved about it. Didn't really have a recipe per se so I winged it and it turned out great. After reading some of these reviews, it's always left up to a person's personal tastes. The dressing is supposed to be a bit thick so it sticks to the grapes and doesn't leave a runny mess at the bottom. Makes for a great salad in the summer on a hot day. 
Creamy Grape Salad#2#0#This grape salad was fabulous! It is fast, uses few ingredients and a great taste. I made it the night before and it held up well. I used sour cream and it gave it a tangy flavor. I will make it again.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Made this to take to a friend. It was sooo good and she's still talking about it! 
Creamy Grape Salad#2#0#Everyone loved this salad. I used Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I have taken this fantastic salad too many gatherings , it is a crowd pleaser !! Vicki, Vail, Az.
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#I took this to a family reunion today and everybody raved about it. and I do mean raved. The bowl came back empty and I had offers to lick the bowl. This is a winner
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Everyone loves this recipe! For summer, I tried a variation. I substituted fresh strawberries for the red grapes - it was delicious too!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#We added cool whip to lighten this recipe. Dressing is too thick
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#When I have to tweak a recipe I automatically take a star away. With that being said, this recipe was good and we enjoyed it but it does need the additional brown sugar for me. I added a fourth of a cup and everyone loved it! I will make it again.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#my grandkids that don't like fruit salads loved this. thanks you its great 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#2#I made this as directed for Easter dinner and think the'dressing' seems too heavy (and twice what is needed). If I make it again I would use 3 oz. of cream cheese, 1/2 C. sour cream and substitute brown sugar for the white sugar and skip sprinkling it over the top. I made this according to directions and while it is tasty, the dressing is just too thick for my taste. 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Good but not excellent
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This is an absolutely fabulous salad. I'm guessing I've made this at least a dozen times since I got the recipe the summer of 2016. Just for fun the other day, I added some blueberries and they were so good in there! I use it as a dessert when I'm craving something sweet. I mix at least a cup or so of chopped walnuts or pecans in instead of sprinkling over the top, and I didn't care so much for the brown sugar, so don't use it at all. This is my favorite salad by far. Wish I could give it ten stars. 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This is perfect for an office potluck or anytime you need to bring a quick treat to a party (the green grapes are perfect for Christmas)! So delicious and addicting! Note: I left off the brown sugar - was already sweet enough for me.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I enjoy this recipe as a way to use my grapes if they aren't getting eaten. 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#reminds me of cheesecake! I have a new potluck dish now.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I mix in heath bar pieces inside when I am mixing in the grapes to the sour cream and cream cheese mixture,My family loves it,a little surprise.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Delicious! I have made it for church potlucks as well as picnics at our cabin. Everyone wants the recipe!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I make this recipe but I put it in a 9x13 pan and put the brown sugar and pecans over the top right away. I think it is better made the day before serving.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Delicious!!! A great potluck dish because it's tasty and different 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I've been making this for years. My recipe has more pecans and brown sugar. If you are even thinking about trying it you definitely should. It's delicious. Take it to a family gathering. You will get rave reviews. 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I have a recipe similar in ingredients to this salad that I got from a friend. I haven't made it yet but my friend puts crushed butterfingers on top of her grape salad. It's really good! 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Made this for a work breakfast. Didn't have enough vanilla so I added a tsp of almond extract. Sweet enough without the brown sugar so I left it off. Perfect. Thank you for the recipe. 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Members of my family are diabetic, so I eliminated the 1/3 C sugar and mixed the brown sugar in with the sour cream. Made a mistake and used 16 oz of low fat sour cream, so I didn't use the cream cheese. Nevertheless, everyone loved it. Two days later, what was left over wasn't enough for two so I added some fresh raspberries. Yum! Now we can't decide which we like better, so I will be making both, probably with just the sour cream. 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#SO yummy!!! excellent just as written!!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I am assuming you can make this the day before and then cover and refrigerate?
Creamy Grape Salad#1#1#We made this for a picnic, and it's delicious! We did leave out the nuts due to a friend with allergies, and after tasting it before the nuts and brown sugar, finding it sweet enough, thats how we left it. 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Made it last night and is still great for breakfast! Also this same almost exact recipe was on Trisha Yearwood's show this morning! 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Made this last night for a ladies gathering and it was well received. So simply and SO yummy! Thanks..will definitely make again!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Simply delicious! Cool and creamy and not too sweet! This is a new favorite in my house.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#WOW! Who would ever thought grapes could taste would be so outstanding as a salad?? I did not add brown sugar or nuts and still be so.....WOW! I look forward to CREAMY GRAPE SALAD!THANK YOU for this recipe!
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#I have had a similar recipe for years and everyone always wants me to make it for showers and reunions. My recipe calls for almond extract and a little brown sugar in the dressing also but is otherwise the same. The biggest challenge to me is getting the grapes dry after washing so that the dressing sticks. Otherwise it just slides off. Not a cheap dish but certainly tasty and someone always asks for the recipe.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This is always a hit!We call it Groovy Grapes!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#1#I made this for a dinner party we had at our house. First off, for this many grapes at about $2/pound (cheapest I could find anywhere in February), was over $8 in grapes alone. Not a cheap dish to make when you add up all the ingredients. I thought the cream cheese mix was tasty, although heavy. Honestly, thought with all the rave reviews that we would be wowed , but in the end, not one person of 15 folks (kids included) mentioned that they liked it. I would not make again. 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Had to promise my family I'd make this awesome salad/dessert every weekend, and I have. As of this review , I've now made it 7 times. .... Thanks a bunch for sharing!!! I added the brown sugar to the pan a soon as the pecans toasted, stirred them around till the sugar melted and ended up with the best tasting pralines!!! Almost forgot ..... one time I had a bit of unsweetened coconut flakes on hand so mixed them in with the creamed mixture ..... Must remember to buy some again, as it was also delicious .... 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#It was just WONDERFUL!!!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I made this recipe for the first time with my Teen cooking class at the Boys and Girls Club and the kids absolutely LOVED IT!!! The kids would ask me for this at least once a week so we made it quite a few times. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#One of my very favorite salad recipes! Very pretty, delicious and easy to make! Definitely a winner in my book!
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#I have been making this for years and the only tip I can give you isn that u do not need the brown sugar, it is just as tasty without it
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I have been making this for many years, it is always a hit. I have my Mother's old Betty Crocker's Hostess Cookbook from 1967 and the recipe is in there. We love this. 
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#This is a GREAT salad. I put praline peacans chopped on top instead of the brown sugar and got rave reviews.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I have made this for years and always get rave reviews. I prefer it with grapes but have made it with many fruits. It is pretty good with blueberries and strawberries on the 4th of July. The only thing I do differently is to combine the pecans and the brown sugar and sprinkle it on the salad before I refrigerate it for several hours. Right before I serve it, I give it a final stir to mix it in. The brown sugar melts a little bit into the pecans and is not quite as grainy. 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#absolutely amazing and so quick to whip up ! refreshing salad with great color to compliment any meal. tasty with cinnamon crusted pecans crushed on top. helpful hint: allowing the grapes to dry after rinsing made the cream cheese mixture stick to the grapes much better.
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#Love this...have made it in smaller batches, too, just for me, myself and I!!
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#This is one of the most delicious salads I have ever made. My family loves grapes and with the combination of cream cheese and sour cream it makes it so tasty.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I have made this for many years, it is ALWAYS a big hit. My grandson who is not fond of fruit absolutely loves this!! I don't add the brown sugar, it melts too soon into the creamy mixture. 
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#Delicious. The recipe is always requested. I left out the brown sugar. And yes it can be served as a salad or a dessert, depends on the presentation. Love it.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#1#My family found this to be extremely sweet with too much of the cream mixture for the amount of grapes. It also seems like more of a dessert than a salad.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Made with no changes for a potluck. It was a hit! Really good recipe.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Very delicious! I made it for a graduation open house and got lots of requests for the recipe. I, too, used the lower fat cream cheese and sour cream. I found that the total amount of brown sugar and nuts was a bit more than really necessary for the presentation in the bowl I used.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This was delicious. I used lower fat cream cheese and vanilla Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I only used 1 Tablespoon of sugar. I would definitely recommend this. I may even use it for other fruit next time!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This recipe is so tasty and refreshing that I add this so my summer entertaining menu and everyone raves about it!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I first made this for a cookout after having it at Christmas potluck. It is really wonderful. I found the grape / cream mixture ratio was a bit off. I find1/2 to 3/4 of the creamed mixture is plenty.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Refreshingly delicious
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I have made this the past several years. I often omit the brown sugar and pecan topping and substitute crushedbutterfinger candy bars. Gives it a different taste with the peanut butter and chocolate. Really good this way.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#My family loves this salad, especially on a warm summer day and the salad is nice and chilled... its awesome
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I found that a little of this goes a long way as it is somewhat on the sweet side.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Excellent
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Fantasic recipes and so good.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#GREAT! I made no changes!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#My favorite salad of the year-5 days later it tastes just as good as the first day. Had a party of 12 people with a lot of other food, had just a third left over. I made it the day before to save time-fast and easy to make.
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#This is a taste of heaven! You can not go wrong with this recipe. Everyone will love this. I eat it as a dessert sometimes. Just wonderful! Love it!! It gets better the next day if it last long. Enjoy!!!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Awesome! I take this for pot lucks and everyone always asks for the recipe!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#The best salad I've ever made. Have sent the recipe many places. 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Made this for Thanksgiving. It was a HUGE hit! I don't like pecans, so I used toasted almonds instead. Tasted even better the next day. 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream(adds protein for same taste). I also used less sugar all the way around and plain chopped baking walnuts instead of pecans. Delicious!
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#I made this salad for our church homecoming and it got rave reviews. It is quick to make and has an excellent flavor. I will make this again!
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#Upon taking this for dinner to share, my friend stated something was missing . I had forgotten to put brown sugar and nuts on the top. What a difference they make!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I made this twice in the past several weeks for two different family parties. It was a hit at both of them. I didn't use the brown sugar/pecan topping, and we still loved it! 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I made this salad yesterday and took it to a salad supper. Nothing but rave reviews. I came home with an almost empty dish. This salad is so good. Several wanted the recipe. Definitely a five star recipe. I highly recommend this recipe as a Volunteer Field Editor for Taste of Home.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I cut my grapes in half and put the brown sugar and nuts in the mixture. I reduced the white sugar and the vanilla to my personal taste. I only used about 2 lbs of grapes also. You can do anything you want to this recipe and it's still going to be fabulous. Great recipe. 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Easy to make and a refreshing new way to eat grapes.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Great
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This was a hit at our church dinner today. Nothing left to bring home!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Great summer salad. Made it for a picnic and it was a hit. Very easy to make and a refreshing way to enjoy grapes
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#Delicious, easy easy to make and just the right amount of sweetness. I melted the brown sugar, added a little cinnamon and roasted the nuts. Made a sweet crunchy topping- perfect!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I have made this for a few years. It is delicious. Everyone I have made it for loves it.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#in my'younger' years, waldorf salad was my fav, but some years ago I added halved grapes, cooked shell noodles and some chopped roasted chicken, diced peppers (any color)..I also toasted the pecans before adding them to the salad..what a wonderful summertime salad..cool n refreshing ! 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This is a great recipe! I'd always considered that doing anything to grapes except eating them right off the bunch was gilding the lily, but after tasting this, I decided if you are going to gild, this was the gilding to do! I'd never made this myself before today, though. We had a bunch of white grapes that were just a bit too tart for us to enjoy eating by themselves, so I mixed this up. It's so quick and so easy, and very forgiving of substitutions--I found that I didn't have sour cream, so used 0% plain Greek yogurt, and then discovered that I'd accidentally grabbed fat free cream cheese at the store, which is a slightly different creature to me than regular or lowfat. And I had no pecans, so I chopped up some almonds. Even with all that, this came out wonderfully, and tasted very similar to what I've had in the past at various gatherings. 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This is one of those recipes that have become a staple at family get togethers, everyone loves it. I always substitute Neufchâtel cheese and fat free sour cream and no one knows the difference.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#The best ever!!!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Delicious - easy to make healthier - use low fat cream cheese and non fat plain yogurt. I used Splenda and only 1/2 of 1/3 cup and no brown sugar on top. Also, dry roasted almonds instead of sugared nuts..
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#One of our children made it after we had dinner. It was a surprise to the entire family! We all thought it was delightful! I will make it for New Years. I will only use green grapes because my family are not fond of red grapes and instead of pecans, I may use almonds.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This is very good!
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#I had never made this salad before I ate it at a picnic..delicious! got the recipe and made it the next day, tossed in some chopped apples and chopped celery. Also, melted the brown sugar and pecans together and poured over top for a crunchy, toffee like topping.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Good but didn't think it was as great as the reviews made it out to be! Probably would have liked it better with less sour cream taste. Was easy to make!! 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#So easy and always a hit!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This recipe is so easy and always a hit!
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#This is one of my families favorite fruit salads. It's great for large family gatherings and potluck dinners. 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Great recipe and easy! Definitely will make again! Makes a large batch for a potluck!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#excellent summer salad
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#A big hit with everyone at family dinners and potlucks
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#My sisiter-in-law brought this for Thanksgiving. She used the big purple globe grapes and everyone thought it was some kind of black olive salad. Boy were we surprised! It was fantastic! I will be making this the next time I go to a pot luck.
Creamy Grape Salad#2#0#Hi I havent actually tried this recipe yet but I was wondering if I could made it the day before serving it and let it set in the fridge all night? I appreciate any help.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I decrease the amount of brown sugar in the topping and add a couple of broken up Butterfinger candy bars. It is a huge hit!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Awesome i made this for a party and next time i'll have to double it! Everyone wanted seconds! 
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#So simple and everyone loves it! I toast the pecans for a richer crispier taste.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Awesome recipe!!! My mother-in-law first made this recipe and now I can't get enough of it. We don't always use the pecans, due to my nephew being allergic. This is a keeper recipe!!! 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I get rave reviews every time I bring this dish to a picnic or dinner. Kids and adults love it!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#If you have friends over and serve this, a good word of advice, make copies of the recipe . 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#My daughter (age 16) and her boyfriend (age 18) made an entire meal for our family. This was one of the recipes they chose. It was a big hit and I am sure we will make it many times again! Thank you Taste of Home!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This is so creamy and so good! I made it for Christmas and all of it was gone before the end of the night! Will definitely be making this again!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This was so creamy and delicious!! Will be making again.
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#This salad is easy to make and uses a minimum of ingredients, which results in a delightful dish. The tartness of the grapes matches perfectly with the sweetness of the dressing. We will definitely be making this again at my house.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This has become our traditional salad for cookouts and even Thanksgiving. I add a couple of delicious apples with the mix..great
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#My sister raved about this and made it for me to try. It was wonderful!! She even used fat free sour cream and low fat cream cheese to cut down on the fat in it and that made absolutely no difference in it, it was just delicious!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#If I do ever make this again, I would cut the cream cheese mixture in half.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This is a delicious recipe. It is a great summer treat. Very addictive!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Everyone looked at it funny and then had seconds! A winner.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#try toasted coconut with brown sugar/pecan mixture..Took it to a Halloween party and called it Hairy eyeballs..a big hit
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Have been making this salad for years --since I saw it in the Bowling Green city paper. We love it. Easy to make and delicious. I use Splenda instead of sugar to cut down on calories. Also use the Splenda blend brown sugar.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#It was very tasty.Everyone loved it. I used light sour cream and light cream cheese. Substituted splenda for the sugar. Next time I think I will add some apple, strawberries and blueberries.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I have made this salad many times for holiday dinners and have taken it to potluck dinners as well. I always get asked for the recipe!So good ....I could almost eat the whole bowl myself.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This is always a hit with our family. Someone makes it for every gathering.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This salad is always a hit! I also use 2 Butterfinger candy bars and 1/4 C. of brown sugar for the topping. Also, you can make it the night before.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Took this to our Pig Roast and it was all gone. The flavor is great!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#a delicious change to any meal especially take to potlucks.
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#I have been making this recipe for years and we LOVE it. My kids have affectionately renamed it Eyeball Salad since, in a clear bowl that's what it kind of looks like. :) I put the nuts and brown sugar on top several hours before serving and it starts to carmelize on top and makes it even better. (I also increase the brown sugar on top) 
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I do not put the brown sugar on top. It gives it a gritty taste that my family does not like. I put it in the sour cream.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#This is a great salad. The 1st time I made it, family was unsure but at the end of the day nothing was left and I have to make it almost all the time now for everything.
Creamy Grape Salad#1#0#Always a hit. I use powdered sugar instead of granular. I think it mixes in better.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I have made this several times and our grandchildren love this salad and think it is a wonderful treat.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I had this at a baby shower and loved it. I have shared the recipe with many others and have made several times, and always get rave reviews.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I had this at a pot luck at work and a co-worker refused to give me the recipe. Only thing different is she used crushed Butterfingers on top and it was awesome. Thanks for the recipe!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#divide by 8 and round up or down. depending if u want left-overs.Zach
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#Yummy =) Everyone loved it.
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I only need about 4 servings of this, do you have the breakdowns for just this many?
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I added a teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the cream cheese mixture. It was great!
Creamy Grape Salad#0#0#I have had this with Splenda and it's just as good, also have used almond instead of vanilla for a stronger flavor. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#3#0#I was worried the peanut butter cups would make this sweeter than I could handle, so I swapped out the cups for crushed Nutter Butter cookies and a tiny sprinkling of kosher salt. WOWWW!!! Highly recommend!!!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#10#2#This recipe has everything a person with a sweet tooth probably loves - peanut butter cups, pudding, whipped topping, and oreos. I don't usually like peanut butter in things except a sandwich but for this delectable dessert I changed my mind! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#3#0#Made this dessert for a potluck my husband and I attended and everyone absolutely loved it. I will definitely make it again!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#3#0#CAN I Freeze this Desert ?
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#21#4#My husband and I and our two guests absolutely loved this dessert! The only change I made was to add 1/2 cup of confectioner's sugar to the cream cheese and omit it from the pudding mix as per another's review. It was perfect! Will make often. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#10#4#I know I've already commented on this recipe years ago but a lady I don't even know just re-found it (the recipe) for me. I could not find this for the life of me and I'm so thankful it was found for me by a kind incredible person.if you haven't made this it's time especially now with holidays fully upon us-YOU WILL BE SO GLAD YOU DID AS WILL THE FRIENDS/FOLKS/FAMILY who are delving into its' lusciousness
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#6#1#Love, love this recipe! When I bring it to potlucks, people always ask for the recipe.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#4#0#Our son-in-law loves anything peanut butter...this one is a keeper. Delicious and easy to put together. I keep the ingredients on hand for this one!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#6#0#This is a fantastic dessert. I actually freeze it, so I can enjoy it longer.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#This is such a good dessert and so easy to put together. Great for summer.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#A staff favourite at our parties. It is always requested. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Thank you Debbie for sharing your recipe. It is amazing! Very easy to put together. Made it to give friends, they absolutely love it, I used about 3/4 cup of peanut butter, just because I wanted to empty the jar! Great recipe!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#2#3#Not sure what everyone is raving about. My family didn't like this at all.. Way to sweet and the instant pudding is just weird. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#2#Absolutely heavenly! Left out the peanut butter cups. Might have been overkill. It was a hit!!!!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Really nice cake. You have really done a nice job. As you have shared the best things for me. Even this recipes can be made in busy time also. It's really special for me. thanks for sharing it here on this site.http://cake-delivery.in/gurgaonhttp://cake-delivery.in/delhihttp://cake-delivery.in/noidahttp://cake-delivery.in/kota 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#I made this without any of the confectioner sugar and it was AMAZING!!! My family loved it!!!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Made it for a work celebration. It was the first dessert gone.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Yummy! Rich, smooth flavor. Leftovers didn't last long! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#2#0#There are really good desserts, then there are GREAT desserts- this one falls under GREAT desserts. It's rich and smooth, with a variety of flavors and textures that marry together for a party in your mouth! A hard to earn 5 stars from me! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Sounds delicious right now and I'm loving it and I'm looking forward to making it some day. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#The first time I made this my family and I was super impressed and it has become the most requested dessert for Sunday dinners.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#This was a big hit! As a Volunteer Field Editor for TOH, I enjoy testing new recipes. As others have suggested, it is very rich and a small serving goes a long way! Very simple to make and a crowd favourite for sure!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#2#0#Delicious but very rich. Could reduce the amount of confectioners sugar and it would still be sweet enough. A 9 x13 pan is not big enough for a doubled recipe. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#I have made this several times. Took it to work to share and even the people who said they only wanted a little bit came back for BIG second helpings. Delish
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#So rich!!! So sweet. A little dab will do you. Impressive to take to parties
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#5#0#This was very good! I placed this in a 9 x 13 pan. I just needed to crush up a few more oreos for the crust to fill the bottom of the pan. I normally don't adjust recipes prior to making them the first time but several people commented about the sweetness of this dessert so I only added 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the cream cheese/peanut butter mixture and none to the chocolate pudding. This was perfect for us! Everyone at the party loved it! I'd definately make it again. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Excellent dessert. I actually had someone who doesn't like sweets say that he loved this recipe because of the peanut butter taste. It is really sweet, but that's the point! Anything that puts chocolate and peanut butter together is going to taste great! I used low-fat, no-fat items where I could, but no one would know. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#5#0#Delicious dessert! I used the new peanut butter filled Oreos for the base and to sprinkle on top and that really put it over the top. I also found a big jar of truly miniature peanut butter cups (about the size of a large chocolate chip) at our local Mennonite store and used those rather than chopping up peanut butter cups. A wonderful cool treat on a very hot summer day!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#4#0#This is really flippin good... I kno i will make (and be asked to make) it again.Its super crazy sweet tho. I will leave the powdered sugar out altogether in the future. I put about a cup in with the cream cheese only bc i had sugar free pb... Its still borderline too sweet tho.We used the butterfinger bits instead of the reeses too.And a little tip for the oreos... I used an already made oreo pie crust for that. It holds together better to spread the cream chesse on top. I just dumped it in the bottom of the casserole dish i used and sorta smashed it down to cover the whole bottom.Still ridiculously good for 10 mins of work!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#I made this for a family get together and everyone loved it!! Will definitely make again.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#This is delicious! This is the second time I have made it for two groups of people and it has been loved by everyone! This will stay in my dessert rotation for sure!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#3#4#I made this yesterday to take to work today-I really enjoyed making this as it was (as many have said) very easy. One thing I didn'tdo was follow the recipe to a T. when I read the ingredients it sounded way too sweet (it was going to have a cloying affect). reading all the reviews I found others thought so too after they had made it. decided to cut the powdered sugar in half. didn't add powdered sugar to the pudding either. Also a change I made was to cut some of the sweetness by adding some creme fresh to the cream cheese. Another thing I did was melted the butter and I broke up the cookies more fine like a pie crust. I knew if I added the melted butter to the cookie crumbs I'd be able to pat it better into the bottom of my container. I put it in the refrigerator overnight because I plan on serving this to my coworkers for the next few days. also omitted putting the cookie chunks and/or the minI peanut butter cups on top because I didn't know how well it would travel on a plane and the top treats would just get squashed plus seemed like overkill.my husband was able to just have one bite last night (and a small bite at that) because his stomach was on fire from Mexican restaurant we went to for dinner. he did say this was very good. I actually think I'll make this several more times. I wish I would've known about it last weekend at our 3yr old's birthday party but I didn't. all in all I think this is a hit.dinged a point because of original recipe being too sweet for our taste as written plus additions&subtractions.PS....UPDATE: July 1stmade it again yesterday for a neighbor who is having a 1st time swim/pool filling up party tonight. I use the 5.9oz pudding mix because I want to make it a large dessert for this US celebration weekend party. I crushed'chocolate colored rock candy' on top for color (from WinCo bulk dept). I won't be here for the party tonight, but hope it will be enjoyed. (ask if you care to know how I changed this recipe to suit our tastes, happy to oblige). 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#These are the best and decious tins i have ever made
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#2#0#I made this for my sister and brother in law's birthday. He likes anything that's peanut butter and chocolate! I found it very easy to make. It was a little tricky getting the Oreos on the bottom. I think next time I would omit the butter and just sprinkle them in the pan. I used fat free cream cheese and light cool whip, still came out great! My brother in law thought it was very rich but I thought it was perfect. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Everyone loved this! I will definitely be making this again.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Made this one year for our Family Christmas. Was a big hit but oh so RICH! You won't need much of it at one time, but oh so delicious! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#This was delicious. Anyone have problem with Oreo crust not sticking?
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#3#0#I opted for a 9x13 pan and totally happy with the result. I used a few more cookies for bottom crust to insure coverage. All finished, the dessert fills the pan to within 1/4 of top edge. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Love love my family loved it
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#3#2#Mine is currently in the fridge setting right now, so I haven't even eaten it yet except for a few tastes here and there. But so far, it's delicious! While prepping this, I popped my unwrapped peanut butter cups in the freezer while I worked on step 3. That way, they were firm and easier to chop. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#OMG this is wonderful. Served it for a family dinner and it was a huge hit. Will make often.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Absolutely decadent! Next time I would combine the pudding with the powdered sugar before adding the milk to prevent clumping. And used maybe a little bigger pan as mine was overflowing
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Made this for my grandson (age 22) and he loved it! Popped the remainder in the freezer just to see what would happen and it froze very well. Now I can have it on hand whenever he stops by and is craving some chocolate.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Wow, this was simple, delicious and a huge hit at work. I added extra peanut butter cups to the top because there can never be enough!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#I did not find it to sweet being that I have made many other desserts that had way to much sugar......I think the pudding helps. I will make it again!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#4#0#The only thing wrong with this, is its too awesome. I can't quit eating it. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#1#I love this recipe! I made it for my husband to take to a work dessert contest and won first place! I'm diabetic, so I tweaked the recipe a little to make it a little lower in sugar. I use light whipped topping, and sugar free pudding. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#I made this for our son's birthday. He loves peanut butter cups and he loved this dessert. Everyone loved it. It is rich but oh so good. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Everyone could not stop talking about how amazing this was!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Very easy and so delicious!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#2#0#Yummy! Very rich & flavorful. Will definitely make again. I used extra peanut butter cups on top - about 10 chopped - to make it look like the picture. I took it to a cookout and it was a hit.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Great but pretty rich and too sweet!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Excellent dessert! I've made this dessert twice now and everyone loves it. Love, love, love..... 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Excellent dish. I froze it to make sure it didn't get soggy. Also used half the sugar. Was still plenty sweet. Will surely make again, perhaps with chunky peanut butter. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#2#0#Loved it!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#too rich and it got soggy fast. won't make again 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#2#0#So good! Really rich though.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Yummm sooo delicious!!! It is pretty rich, so I couldn't eat too big off a piece, but it was amazing! If you like peanut butter and chocolate together, this recipe is for you! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#This was the best combination of chocolate and peanut butter I have had.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#This was amazing. I made it for my boyfriends birthday and then for Christmas Eve. Everyone loved it.One of the complaints was that it was too sweet. I made it with sugar free cool whip and chocolate pudding, and light PB. It was not to rich. Just do not use light or reduced fat cream cheese because it changes the consistency.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#My sister made this and shared with us. If you like rich desert this is the desert for you! We loved it and I definitely added it to my favorite desert recipes!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#I was impressed! I served it when we had some friends over and everyone couldn't get over how good it was. Even the picky toddler ate it who usually won't even eat dessert! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#This dessert is awesome!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Great recipe!!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Surprisingly, not a hit with the group of teen guys I fed it to. I think it was too mushy, not enough substance. I make a similar trifle dish, but with much more brownies to make it more cake like. Too much trouble and not even one person said they liked it.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#5 stars. I made this for Christmas dinner and my son raved about it. It is his new FAVORITE dessert and has requested it for any future gathering that we have. :)
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Wow this was really tasty. It is extremely filling, so a little goes quite a long way. We used more Oreos than the package called for, because I wanted them to fill the bottom of the pan. This was fun to make with the kids, and everyone absolutely loved it. I will absolutely make this again for a party.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#3#All I can say is...WOW! This dessert is absolutely one of the best I have ever had. So easy because you don't even have to bake it. It was a huge hit! I do have to add that I accidentally bought an 8 oz, container of whipped topping (misread the recipe), and I almost panicked. But since I didn't discover it until too l ate, I had no choice but to just split that one. As far as I know, it worked out fine. I am wondering now if it's better this way! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#2#0#This is absolutely the BEST dessert!!!! Since I have found the recipe, just a month or so ago, I have made it 3 times!!!! Everyone just went crazy over it. So simple to make. This is my new dessert to make and take to anywhere!!! Just FYI, I made it in an 11 x 9 pan, next time, I will double the crust. Wouldn't hurt to double the crust anyway!!! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Need to bring this to work, has anybody tried to do this in cupcake papers or small cups to make serving easier. Thank you
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#This recipe is sickenly sweet. Way too rich.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#A little too sweet/rich for our taste, but it is good.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#This was wonderful! I've made it twice and got rave reviews and I'm making it again this weekend. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Very good recipe
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#All I can say is that this is the BEST recipe ever! It is sooo easy to make, with just a few ingredients, and yet extremely delicious!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#2#0#Absolutely wonderful!!! Great dessert to take for church potlucks, always disappears. Will be making it for Labor Day weekend. Can also substitute Butterfinger bars, crushed, in place Peanut Butter cups. Also, I sometimes sprinkle chopped pecans on top.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#This recipe is definitely a keeper. I made it for a family dinner and it got rave reviews. The peanut butter flavor came through with the chocolate for a taste combination that is classic. Thank you for sharing a great desert.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#This is our favorite dessert in this house and definitely different than most others which is what I like about it. It's easy to make and has a lot of great flavors in each layer. The perfect combination dessert with chocolate and peanut butter. I have already made it several times and I get request from my husbands work to make it for their pot lucks and also when we have family visiting. It's definitely a keeper! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Forgot the stars. Would give it more if I could
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Got rave reviews at Easter when I served this. Was The Best dessert I have had in a long time.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Excellent dessert! My fiance absolutely loved it and has already asked if I can make it again! I used chunky peanut butter instead of creamy as well and it turned out really well. It was a nice way to put that much needed crunch in the middle of all the deliscious creamy-ness. It a winner in this house and will certainly be used again thank you!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#I was a little intimidated by this recipe at first, but it turned out beautifully. To make it easier to crush the cookies, I put them in the fridge to get cold, then placed in a sandwich bagand using a mallet, pounded the cookies till they were crushed. I also placed the peanut butter cups in the fridge to make cutting them easier. Everyone loved this recipe and I make it as the recipe states. The presentation was awesome.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#my family and friends loved this on Easter day
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Rich, but oooohhhh so good!!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Peanut butter & chocolate lovers will adore this recipe. My company raved about it & it was easy to assemble!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#I made this for my oh-so-refined women's group and many had seconds, and thirds! It was a huge hit and I know it will become my go-to rich dessert. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Awesome,delicious
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#This was so yummy....would definately make it again!!!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Haven't tried the recipe yet .Would like t know what size pan you used. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Outstanding!! Very rich!!!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Is it one small box of the chocolate fudge pudding?  Recipe calls for 3.9 ounces but neither the large or small box of Jello Pudding is 3.9 oz? Many thanks for a response as I'm making this tomorrow. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#This is a favorite at my house. I have made it many many times for friends family and coworkers. I cannot count how many people have literally begged me for this recipe. I make it several times a year. It is absolutely delicious.

Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#I made this for the Father's Day and then my daughter made this for Thanksgiving. Everyone loves this dessert. It takes a little while to assemble, but it is definitely a keeper! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#i've made this three times in the last year. Every holiday someone calls and requests it. It's been a big hit. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Everyone loved this.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#I didn't enjoy the texture or the taste of this dessert, but my kids liked it. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#AMAZING tasting. I wouldn't have put it in the simple section though. It took my two hours and too many dirty dishes! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#This recipe is awesome! Everyone that tried it wanted the recipe. Very rich, have made it several time. I want to eat the whole pan myself and not share. LOL
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#What does she mean by fold in the whipped topping?
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#I made this for a Memorial Day party. It was outragously delicious! I did increase the recipe, 1 1/2 to make it in a 13 x 9 pan which worked out well. Nobody could get enough of this dessert!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#1#I made this dessert on Memorial Day and for a family dinner yesterday. It was thoroughly enjoyed both times! The recipe is easy to put together and comes in handy on HOT summer days - no baking required! The first time I made it, I didn't put the whipped topping in the peanut butter and cream cheese layer and it still turned out great. I suggest using a dish larger than 9 square and adding more crushed cookies for the crust. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Made it for Fathers Day and everyone loved it. Was not hard to make. Did not find it over rich. I did add more peanut butter cups. Would make it again.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#I happened to have Oreo cookies with green mint filling and used this for the recipe. It was delicious!!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Very rich, but oh so tasty!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#This recipe takes a little time to do, each layer has it's own prep work ...BUT.... it is worth the effort! My family LOVED this no-bake, very rich dessert! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#It was rich, but very good. I made it for a summer holiday dinner and it was a big hit!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#The results are fabulous, but I disagree with the submitter that it's a cinch to whip up because there's no baking involved - 4 bowls, two washes of the beaters, letting things set up, etc. - I could have whipped up a fantastic batch of brownies (which are baked) in about the same amount of time or less actually. Just because you don't have to bake it, doesn't mean it's a cinch. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Absolutely Beautiful....gushing with flavour and such a strong taste of beauty!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Very rich but delicious! My family loved it.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#For Spellcheck. Technically, you would do 1 1/2 recipe for a 9x13 pan, but for ease of making, just double everything. It makes it a bit thicker, but oh so yummy!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Fantastic! Everyone loved it. One small thing I would change is to omit the 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar in the pudding layer. It's plenty sweet already.For the reviewer whose pudding layer didn't set up, don't forget to let the pudding stand until soft-set. I put mine into the refrigerator for this step.For the reviewer asking whether to leave the cream on the cookies; yes, leave it on. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#This got rave reviews when I served it to friends. So rich, creamy and delicious. Have a glass of milk handy when you eat it. It's amazing! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#This came out fantastic! Made it for my in-law's birthday and the entire family gobbled it up =D Next time I want to try freezing it, though it was very good right out of the fridge! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Fabulous! Anyone know how to convert the ingredients to fit a 9 x 13 pan?
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Yes crush the whole cream filled chocolate cookies. You'll have delicious black and white crumbs for the crust. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#A big hit especially for peanut butter lovers!!!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Would someone please tell me if you leave the cream on the chocolate cookies when you crush them. Thank you.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#wonderful - i make a make-over version of this. would love to know the new nutrition facts. it's still bad for you, but not as bad. - 1 tbsp butter, 1/2 to 3/4 cup confect. sugar mixed with the cr. cheese and pb. No sugar added to pudding mix, made with skim milk. use light whipped topping. still decadent! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#AMAZING! Best combination ever. I can't wait to try this recipe. You are a genius - thank you for sharing. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Out of this world. Easy to make and it was a big hit. Will make it again but will double the recipes......Rich but delicious....
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#One of Faith's faves! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#1#Made this for a Christmas family gathering, and everyone loved it. I took an empty dish home!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#This was awsome! The taste of Peanut Butter was soooo good! Thanks again!!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#This is one of the best desserts I have ever had! Everyone always requests me to make this for all of our family/friend's get-togethers! I would suggest buying the bag of mini reese's peanut butter cups to save time on unwrapping and chopping the larger peanut butter cups. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#So delicious! This dessert is easy to make and it is such a nice alternative to the typical dessert of cookies or cake. It is so thick and rich that you don't need a lot of it to feel satisfied; so it feeds a lot of people! The best part is that it's easy to make healthier by using reduced-fat oreos, cream cheese, peanut butter, whipped topping, and milk. Cannot wait to make this dessert again!! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Simple and what is there not to love about chocolate and peanut butter. Very rich and so very delicious!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#This was a excellant dessert and a total hit with myself and family.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#but my pudding layer did not set it was runny. I left it off.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#This is lucious. Made it for teachers for a dinner and everyone raved over it. None left.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#My husband is the big sweet eater in the family and he is picky about his food. He gave this 5 stars all the way.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#I have not made this yet but wanted to know if you use Chocolate cream cookies or Oreo's? I want to try to make it for a dinner soon & was just wondering what others use. Thanks for the recipe it sounds & looks so YUMMY! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#I first made this dessert when I found it in the Taste of Home several years ago. It was fantastic and a huge hit with the family. I get requests for it from family when we are getting together to celebrate.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#@marilyn linn- in recipes like this do not remove the cream filling, but make sure you crush the cookies as finely as possible so they make a better crust. enjoy!!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#This is a great dessert. Our family has made it many times for special gatherings!!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#1#0#Please tell me if one is supposed to remove the cream filling from the cookies before crushing them.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#I have made this dessert many times for friends and family. Everyone enjoys and always wants seconds. I have also modified it into just a peanut butter pie. Its quick and easy and very DELICIOUS!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Really good recipe. Everyone really enjoyed it and it does taste even better frozen.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#I purchased the 2009 Edition ofTaste of Home Prize Winning Recipes at the beach. I continue to use the recipes in this magazine on a regular basis. The Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert recipe is to die for and yes, I will make it again and again.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Making this for a second time in two weeks ! This dessert is FABULOUS !! and definitely better frozen ( just holds together better and resembles ice-cream cake in a way. The first night that I made this, a family member requested that I bring this to their next birthday event !
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#I used a 9x13 dish so I added a little extra of everything. VERY yummy.... I served frozen
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#This dessert was much better frozen!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Great...next time I'm going to try freezing it, and taking in out 15 min before... 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Just great. I made in a nine inch pan so added just about 4 more oreo's and 5 more peanut buter minatures. It was a hit. bluemistglows@snet.net a little more time consuming, but worth the time for such good flavor. bluemistglows@snet.net Susan from Connecticut 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#I made this for the first time about 5 years ago.Every time I've made it, I never have any leftovers. 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#This was an instant favorite! Instead of the cookie crust, I broke up some leftover brownies. I also layered mine in a clear, glass bowl, alternating each layer at least twice...it just dressed it up a little and added some eye-appeal.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#This recipe always gets compliments when I make it for company! I usually use the lower fat neufchatel cream cheese and it turns out great. I've also made this recipe using the smaller container of whipped topping for a denser consistency - both ways work fine! Great recipe!!! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#This is a HIT. I double for a 9x13 pan, and used whipped real whipping cream with no sugar instead of coolwhip.
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#Everyone at work went crazy for this!! It is delicious and very rich.....will definitely make it again!
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#I absolutely love the marriage between chocolate and peanut butter so when I saw this I had to make it. It was so good that my friend and I ate it until we were insanely full and didn't feel good anymore. (so the amount this recipe calls forgoes a long way for a lot of guests since its so rick). Also, crush your cookies VERY well, use more butter, and melt it so that your crust remains in tack!!!! excellent. Im making it again tonight for a company bbq! 
Peanut Butter Chocolate Dessert#0#0#This was heaven!!!!!!!!!!!!! YUM!!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Added carrots and potatoes - beef broth in place of water - plus thickened liquid with corn starch to complete the meal. This has been a family favorite for years!
Flavorful Pot Roast#13#6#I used 1 bottom round roast, put carrots and potatoes under roast and used 1 quart of beef broth instead of water, on low for 8 hours, then thickened it with corn starch. Amazing!!! Although the gravy is so delicious it would be even better on mashed potatoes!
Flavorful Pot Roast#8#0#Sounds like time for a sub roll or something similar and French Dip Sandwiches!! Yum!
Flavorful Pot Roast#13#0#I've made this dozens of times and it's SO delicious! The chuck roast comes out perfect--tender and juicy, and the sauce is scrumptious. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#57#7#I am the 75 years young Chief Cook and bottle washer in our home. I made this recipe exactly as posted and it was DELICIIOUS, juicy, and tender. I put the juices in a small pan and thickened the gravy with 2 TBs flour whisked in 1/2 cup water and served it with mashed potatoes and green beans. I got rave reviews from my wife of 50 years. Love your recipes! Keep up the Great work.
Flavorful Pot Roast#12#3#i though this pot roast was excellent after its cooked i shred it up and thicken the juices with some cornstarch then add the meat back into the juice very yummy
Flavorful Pot Roast#8#5#This is a very tasty recipe. I agree with the previous poster, make sure you use the amount of meat or it will be salty. There has been times where I omitted the Italian dressing. Just using the gravy mix and the ranch dressing is still very flavorful.
Flavorful Pot Roast#27#0#To tsuop: This is delicious!! Nowhere does the contributor say it is home made . If you can't say anything nice, find a home made recipe and move on!! 
Flavorful Pot Roast#7#0#We love this recipe. I've made it several times, many times just for the two of us so plenty of leftovers. I always double the gravy mixture so there is plenty for potatoes. Yummy!
Flavorful Pot Roast#12#0#Easy, tasty recipe. Many reviewers found it too salty. I wonder if they are only using one roast? I used two roasts, totaling about 6 pounds. The flavor reminded me of a french dip, I plan to shred the second roast, make some tasty homemade bread, add some swiss cheese, and use the remaining broth as french dip. Or, perhaps do an open faced sandwich. Yum.
Flavorful Pot Roast#8#1#Tried this on Sunday and it was delicious!!! The meat melted in your mouth and it had so much flavor. I did, however. first season the roast with meat tenderizer, salt, pepper, garlic powder and then browned it in olive oil and the put in the crockpot. Then poured the mixture in the fry pan scrapping up the browned bits from the bottom poured over the meat and added another 1/4 cup of water. Cooked for 41/2 hrs and it was falling apart, so tender!! Will definitely make again!!!
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#1#Made according to recipe and we found it extremely spicy and salty. Not sure what happened here as I can see all the 5 star reviews. Glad everyone else enjoyed it!
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#0#We love this recipe, easy and great taste
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Very tasty and very easy to make!
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#0#Made this in the crock pot last Sunday. YUMMY! This will be my go to recipe. Very easy to make.
Flavorful Pot Roast#4#0#Absolutely delicious and so very easy to make. The only change I made was to use two small arm roasts that I had on hand rather than chuck roast. The gravy was delicious. I will definitely be making this my go-to pot roast recipe from now on!
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#0#So easy and the best tasting ever! Whole family loves this one.
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#0#This is a super recipe. Since it's just the two of us I used just one roast. I also omitted the ranch dressing mix because we despise the flavor. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Delicious recipe, very easy to prepare. I used 3 cups of water rather than me 1/2 cup in the recipe. It was not salty. Good night
Flavorful Pot Roast#5#0#This is the first recipe review I have ever given, and this recipe deserves all the accolades it can possibly get! I am not even a big meat eater, but I have made this pot roast TWICE in the past month. I hate salty food, and I didn't find this this salty at all. I only made one roast, and slid a few chopped up potatoes, carrots, onions, and garlic cloves under it (to make it all fit in my 4 quart crockpot). I also added 1/4 cup of water to the recipe (because I love the gravy)! My family likes the beef (which totally falls apart) and potatoes, while I favor the gravy and carrots. We all enjoy it over rice pilaf. It smells SO good while its simmering merrily in the crockpot ~ Try it tonight! 
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#0#I didn't change a thing. My family loved it. Very flavorful and fall apart tender. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#7#0#I've been making this recipe for twenty years. I only use one boneless chuck roast and put potatoes and carrot chunks under it and cook at 325 in the oven in my covered Dutch oven for about two and a half hours. I also use a bit more water to make sure I have enough of the gravy 
Flavorful Pot Roast#2#0#This has become a favorite! I like to put fresh mushrooms and/or green beans under the roast and wow! This recipe also works beautifully with pork butt!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#One of my favorite recipes. But I also add a stick of butter! Superb!!!!!!
Flavorful Pot Roast#6#0#This is my favorite pot roast! I've been making it for years and it is always very good. I sometimes just buy stew meat, add some potatoes and carrots and do the same thing. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Salty, but perfect over mashed potatoes. Will definitely be making this again.
Flavorful Pot Roast#2#0#It is very flavorful but also very salty. I like things a little salty and this was too salty for me.
Flavorful Pot Roast#2#0#I made some mashed potatoes and served the meat over the potatoes and there were no leftovers! I used beef stock instead of water and this was the most flavorful roast I've ever had. Definitely making it again! 
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#3#I made this a week ago and felt I should like it since I've heard so much about this type of roast. I used this recipe which except I added the pepperoncini as the recipe for Mississippi Pot roast uses. It was just average. Was hoping to rave about it but can't. Won't make this again. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#4#0#the finish product was delicious, but I only used half of the packages. I served it with mashed potatoes and corn fritters...
Flavorful Pot Roast#3#0#Family favorite. My daughter first made this & we thought it too salty, too, so she recommended when I make it, add 1/2 packets of ranch & Italian dressing mix & use lower sodium gravy mix. I do & that helps lower sodium. Very easy, tasty.
Flavorful Pot Roast#4#1#Did a 2 1/2 #pot roast with half the mixes and turned out perfect. Only there wasn't much gravy and I added 2 c water and didn't add beef bouillon to make up for it so it wasn't as tasty as it could have been. I served the gravy over the roast and mashed potatoes. My husband is a chef and he said the roast was amazing and moist. I will make this from now on but will make sure to make the gravy to match. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#0#Loved this recipe!!! The only thing that I changed was I substituted with 32 oz of beef broth and added diced golden potatoes with carrots. Excellent recipe.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#2#We did not like this at all. It was too salty from all the packaged mixes. I will not be making this again.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#My family has enjoyed this dish for years now! Everyone LOVES this meal!
Flavorful Pot Roast#2#1#carolbrummett, then tweek the recipe to suite your taste buds. and yes, these recipes are by real cooks. have a nice day. :)
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This was really flavorful and quick to prepare and put in crockpot.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Delicious as written. But beef broth i/of water even more flavorful.
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#0#This was very good - might add 1 cup of beef broth (low sodium) next time instead of water, to give it a little more beef flavor. Also added carrots & potatoes on top and made gravy with left over juices for a complete meal.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This was really good. I only used one roast.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#The best pot roast ever. Have made this many times and you can't beat it for easy and sooooo tasty! 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#25#Taste of Home use to be real recipes by real cooks. This recipe is terrible. It's full of prepackaged, fake ingredients, artificial colors, artificial flavors, preservatives, way too much salt and is very unhealthy. Do not feed this recipe to your Family. Cook real food. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#2#0#Excellent! I added baby potatoes, portabella and button mushrooms for the last 4 hours.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Excellent!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Flavorful.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#My kind of crock pot recipe - quick and easy! Smelled so yummy and the meat just fell apart! Served with mashed potatoes and hubby put the extra gravy on everything.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Just a great and easy recipe. We have a large family and this Christmas will be the third time I've made this wonderful entree. Thank you! 
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#0#My wife made this the other night and we all loved it. She doubled the ingredients because she added vegetables to it. Its a keeper for us. Well make again.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I, too, was a little skeptical about the mixes but this pot roast recipe is wonderful! It was tender, juicy and absolutely delicious! A KEEPER!
Flavorful Pot Roast#2#0#Move over Lipton Onion Soup mix recipe.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#So easy,Wonderful flavor, gravy was great over mashed potatoes!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Family favorite!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Very flavorful. I use 1/4 wine and 1/4 cup of beef broth in place of the water.I have also used onion soup mix instead of the brown gravy mix.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#My absolute favorite roast recipe. I have made this so many times. I usually remove the roast at the end and add cornstarch/water to make gravy.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This was very good and gave great flavor to a very large roast! Will make again.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Amazing!!! We loved this dish, and it was so easy to make! I used about 3 lbs of pork roast and chuck roast (my mom swears by combining both roasts in a pan). I cooked them in a dutch oven in the oven for an hour at 375, then for about 3 more hours at 300. The meat was so tender and flavorful. I will definitely make this again soon!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I used canned beef gravy and it was delicious. I read the shopping list wrong, so I went for it
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#0#LOVED the flavor but it was toooooo salty.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Not sure why, but we just didn't like the flavor of this. It does make a lot of gravy, so I understand why mashed potatoes are the suggested side. I added carrots and potatoes to the crock pot, and the flavors just didn't work well together. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#My husband absolutely loves roast this way. His absolute favorite, and mine as well since it is so easy!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Yummy!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This is handsdown the best roast recipe I have tried. It is simple, easy and full of flavor. Just the memory of it will make your mouth water.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I just made this for Sunday dinner it was really good. I put my roast in the oven on 350 degrees for about 3.5 to 4 hours..I came out great. I removed the roast the last 1.5 hours sliced it added some cornstarch to the gravy prior to serving. With some homemade mashed potatoes this is delicious. I would definitely make this again.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Very easy and flavorful. I added a few carrots in the bottom of the slow cooker and served it with the gravy & mashed potaotes. Hubby thought it was a keeper and so did I.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I have made this several times. I use one larger roast instead of two smaller ones. I also put onions, green peppers, and mushrooms in.
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#0#I changed up the seasoning a little based on what I had in the pantry. I used 1 packet of mushroom gravy mix, 1 pack of ranch seasoning, and 1 packet of Lipton's Onion Mushroom soup mix. I also added potatoes, carrots, celery, and onion on top of the roast. It was fantastic!!! I will definitely be making it again. It was so easy and it tastes delicious. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Great flavor. Moist meat. Easy to make. Has become a family favorite!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#The best roast I have ever had. I have made it 3 times now. I did have to adjust the ingredients for 2, and it is still wonderful.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Delicious! Enjoyed by the whole family. I added onion, mushrooms and potatoes. Gravy was phenomenal.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Family loved it!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Taste great but only cooked chuck roast for 5 hours on low.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#AMAZING! I used only one chuck roast since there's only 2 of us and omitted the ranch, just because I was a cheapskate at the store. Definitely worth making.~ Theresa 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This was so easy and tasted pretty good, although it seemed a little too salty. I too, put potatoes, carrots and some onion on the bottom.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This pot raost was amazing!!! It was so tender and FLAVORFUL! I also thickened the juices to make the gravy. My family of 4 was sad to find out there wasn't enough for seconds. I will double the amount of chuck roast next time for sure, so there is enough for seconds. I added carrots, potatos and onion to mine! Mm. Mm. MMMmm! 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Very good. A little on the tangy side from the Italian dressing, which I enjoy, but if you have family members who do not just use a half a packet or less of Italian dressing. I usually uuse a 4 pound roast so I just do two of Ranch, 2 of brown gravy, and 1 of italian dressing in a cup of water. When i thinken the juices for gravy I just add some corn starch or flour to some cold waterbefore I mixit in to the juices to avoid lumps. The best part is it is so easy yet tastes so good.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#My family said this was the best roast I have ever made! I used a 3.5 lb roast and layered onions, carrots and new potatoes (cut in half) underneath the meat. For me, it took the full cooking time.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#One of our favorite recipes!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I sprinkled the roast with salt and pepper, then rolled in flour and put on top of carrots, onion, and a potato and let sit on low for 10 hours. Great recipe!
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#0#Love this recipe! I add potatoes on the bottom of the slow cooker and then chopped onions and whole baby carrots. I use two of each dressing mix and gravy mix and pour on top of all the beef, carrots, and potatoes; and let it cook for 8-10 hrs. This makes a quick and easy Sunday dinner =)
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This is one of my go-to recipes! The flavor is awesome!!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#So easy and delicious! The meat was incredibly tender! I didn't have brown gravy mix so I just stirred beef bullion and cornstarch into the water. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#So easy and delicious! The meat was incredibly tender! I didn't have brown gravy mix so I just stirred beef bullion and cornstarch into the water. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Fantastic and easy..I almost got the wrong size brown gravy envelope..got the smaller one and threw vegetables in and everything was fine, i don't like salty and it wasn't.. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#4#So disappointing. NOT GOOD AT ALL! Threw it all out.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Nice!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I didn't have dry salad dressing envelopes in the pantry, so I used bottled Zesty Italian and Ranch dressing -about 1/2 cup apiece, with a jar of savory beef gravy. Carrots in the pot with it and about six and a half hours cook time - only did one potroast of about 3 lbs - just delicious and enough gravy to throw over rice. Great recipe!! 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#6#how old was your dog?
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Made it tonight and everyone loved it. It's easy, didnt over or undercook and tasted great. I added some carrots and potatoes about 4 hrs into it. Then from the suggestion of another member, added cornstarch to thicken the liquid to use as gravy. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Great Pot Roast Recipe. Pot Roast is not usually a favorite with my husband & I, but this recipe really appealed to us. Hubby kept complimenting me all night. Very tender, juicy, & tasty! I cooked it with potatoes, onions, & carrots. I also used bit more water, about 3/4 cup. Brought back memories of my Mom's Pot Roast when she made it in a pressure cooker. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Let me get this straight you use 3 packages of mixes but only 1/2 cup of water? That just makes a paste right, it does not seem like that is enough fluid.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Seasonings overpowered the taste of the roast
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This recipe is an absolute keeper. I've made it many times since I found it on the website and it's a huge family favorite. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#The whole family loved this one!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#The family loved this. Will make again.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This recipe definitely lives up to its name. However i'd like to try it with sirloin tips next time. I did add a normandy veggie mix to this towards the end of cooking. I served it with loaded mashed potatoes and the fam loved it 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#The flavor was very very good but I over cooked it :( 6 hours in my slow cooker was to long. Would have been very yummy with mashed potatoes!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Popnmin-yes you can add vegetable to this recipe,When i make it I add the vegetables on the bottom and then the roast.This also makes a good gravy,to thicken it up some up can add a little cornstratch to some water and add it.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Very easy recipe! I make regularly for my family. I add a bag of carrots and make sure to make mashed potatoes for this one!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#2#this had a good flavour but using pkg. dressing mixes not a good idea as i read the ingr. and has way too much sodium and chemicals not good for you better to go make your own route.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This is delicious. I made this for some picky company and they even asked for the recipe!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I made this the first time for company, an they loved it lol even took some to work cold a keeper
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#My whole family LOVES this recipe! I make it at least once a month. I add either baby carrots or chunks of carrots to it...that's my favorite part! I let the carrots cook the entire. @popnmim...you can add potatoes, too, but I prefer to make creamed potatoes to go with it. : ) 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I am an old man learning to cook for myself and wife. Don't know much and depend on Taste of Home to keep me straight.Can you add vegetables to this, when and how many? 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#One of the best pot roast I have made and will make again from now on!!!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Amazing flavor and so easy! The only roast recipe for my family from now on.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#A.M.A.Z.I.N.G! My whole family loved this recipe. From now on, I won't be making my roast any other way! Sooo good. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#We have made this over and over again -my husband pulls it with a fork when it is done. One of the easiest recipes and one of the best! I even purchased Ranch Dip mix by accident and it's just as good! 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#One of my favorites to make when serving a pot roast
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I agree with Carrie -- I won't make roast any other way! I cut the recipe in half for my family and save the other half of the dressing and sauce mixes in a Ziploc bag so they'll be ready for the next time! 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Although this is delicious just the way it's shown, I find we like it even better with a can of cream of mushroom soup stirred into the sauce. This increases the gravy and gives it a nice creamy texture. It has a delicious flavor prepared this way. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Easy and tasty - This is a truly amazing recipe! My only complaint is that there wasn't enough! 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Truly excellent. I will not make a roast any other way now. I do up the water to one cup so there is more gravy.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This was super easy, flavorful and tender.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#it was delicious and my boyfriend just asked me to make it again for the 3rd time..i was afraid to try the vegetables due to the comments but i'm going to try them and see how they come out after the last comment said they were fine 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Even though some reviewers said it was too salty, I decided to make it as it was written (FYI the env. of ranch dressing mix I used was 1 oz, the env. of Italian salad dressing mix was 0.7 oz. and the env. of brown gravy mix was 0.87 oz. (The brands I used are well known). After pouring the mixure over the meat, I added cut potates and carrots on top (many reviewers suggested adding these vegetables). IT CAME OUT PERFECT AND NOT SALTY AT ALL! My husband rated it EXCELLENT!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#So easy and so delicious!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Amazing is all I have to say! I just used a large 5 lb roast instead of the 2 smaller ones. I also threw it in the crock pot frozen and put it on high for about an hour and then down to low for 6 hours and it was great. And don't forget about the gravy it makes! Wow and all of our dinner guests (5 people) loved it too! 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#very good roast, but mine was VERY salty. I don't know which of the powdered mixes made it so salty, but other then that is was very flavorful. I think the brown gravy mix may have been the culprit. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#it was good - but very salty. won't make it this way again because of the sodium content, not because of the flavor. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Oh, yes! Makes Sunday dinner a breeze. I added carrot chunks to make it a full dinner with mashed potatoes. The only criticism I have is the gravy needs to be thicker - maybe adding a tablespoon or so of cornstarch the last half hour would do it. Love this easy recipe!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Very Very good! Even my mother in law who is a VERY tough critic loved it.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#absolutely delicious flavor and so tender it practically melts in your mouth. definitely a winner.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Roast beef can some times be boring, but not this recipe. Excellent.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This was amazing - I will only make pot roast this way from now on!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#So easy and truly EXCELLENT. My 3 year old asked for 3rd helpings and my husband told me it was the best meat he has ever eaten. I can honestly say I don't think I would make a pot roast any other way after this! I did up the water to one cup for more gravy. Delicious. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#We enjoyed this recipe as written the first few times I made it. Last time I added a can of Cream of Mushroom Soup and it was even tastier. It adds flavor and makes a creamier gravy.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#EXCELLENT and simple recipe. I also added potatoes and carrots to make it a complete dinner. My husband loved it and is already requesting it again.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I made this once and now my family wants this all the time! it is wonderful!!!! a must try!!!!! thank you for this recipe!!!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#My husband still hasn't stopped talking about how great this is! I only cooked 1 roast and my husband had 3/4 of it by himself. One of my sons had the other 1/4 and the 2nd son, daughter & I had none since there was none left. Usually roast sits in the fridge for days leftover so I expected the same result. Not with this recipe. I may have to buy a couple more crockpots to keep up with the demand. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I'm not a big meat-eater, but this roast was fabulous! I used a three pound roast and threw in carrots, celery, potatoes, onions, and mushrooms. The roast was extremely tender and juicy. I can't wait to make it again. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Excellent recipe. This was so delicious! I kept forgetting to buy the ranch mix at the store, so I just used more Italian with the gravy and it was still great. Next time I will try it with the ranch.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#made this last night and all i can say is YUMMY. served it with mashed potatoes and what a meal. even my picky eater loved it. this is definitely a keeper!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This was very flavorful, one of the best pot roasts we ever had. Added carrot, potatoes and some onion. Next time will thicken the juices some.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#So simple and yet so tasty! I'll make this again and again. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#WONDERFUL RECIPE!!!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I am making this for the 2nd time. Love it, Love it, Love it. Simple but wonderful.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I have tried pot roast several times over the years. The dogs usually enjoy it. To bad there was none left for them this time. This was excellent! I WILL be making this again,
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I've been making this recipe for years, I found the recipe in a newspaper grocery circular and shared it with family and friends, many times and we all love it. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Served this to guests and everyone raved about it! I served it with boiled red potatoes and a salad.....enough said....a great complete meal!
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#0#I have a smaller crockpot, so just used a 3 lb roast. Added new potatoes,celery,baby carrots & onions. DELICIOUS! And I'm just learning to cook, but husband & I both agree this is a definite keeper! 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Super easy to make and great taste. I did add some vegetables to mine and they came out very salty. I guess that's why this recipe does not call for any vegetables. The meat was perfect (not too salty). 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This is a super easy recipe, and now is my family's favorite potroast. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This recipe is so flavorful. I have made thisseveral times already.I have added potatoesand carrots at the beginning of cooking.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Incredibly simply and tastes amazing!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I have never been much on beef roast, I just didn't like the taste of it. The only use I had for a beef roast was to cook and shred it to make vegetable soup. I have to admit the combination of the dressings just didn't sound like they went with roast, but after reading all the reviews I wanted to try it. Boy am I glad I did!!!!!!!!!!! I was still skeptical even as I mixed the packets together to pour over the meat. But one taste put all skepticism to rest. I made gravy from the juices and it was delicious. I've even thought of other ways I can use this combination of seasonings for other beef dishes. Thanks so much for sharing. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I've made a lot of different pot roast recipes, but this is by far the family favorite. It has so much flavor. It's now the only recipe I use. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This was delicious!!! The meat was so moist and tender, it was falling apart. I added carrots and potatoes in with it and they were just as tasty. This will be a regular on our menu!

Flavorful Pot Roast#1#0#Tried this recipe tonight and the gravy was much too salty for me. Will do again but with a low sodium Italian dressing.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#1#Made this tonight for a date.... with some adjustments. I used either top round or bottom round roasts (not sure which.... my butcher cut it for me. I added six chopped smallish red potatoes, 4 carrots cut into 1/2 inch pieces, a sliced stalk of celery and a few Tbsp. Minced garlic and a sliced onion. I added 1/2 cup red cooking wine as well. I also thickened it with a slurry of flour and water. It turned out delicious. The only thing I would do differently is leave out the onion. For some reason, I am not too pleased with the taste of onions in all the slow cooker recipes I have tried. This is delicious though. I sliced up one of the roasts and have it keeping warm in the gravy, and the other I set aside in my fridge.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This recipe is the same as To Die For crockpot roast on recipezaar.com
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I loved this potpoast but I need to know if the calories for 6oz is correct (142)? I am on a diet. Thank you
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Really good, very simple!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This was in an issue many years ago. I make it all the time, my family loves it. I cook noodles separtely and put some of the great juices over it.YUM!!! My husband and the kids love it. So easy.
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#0#I have not made this pot roast but have made others and placed carrots, cut up potatoes, and onions on bottom with pot roast on top. I probably would add some more liquid to this one, at least another 1/2 cup.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Can you add potatoes and carrots and or other vegitables to this potroast with only about condiments or do you need to add more liquid?
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I live alone and I'm a big fan of this pot roast. The leftovers make a great veriety of dishes. 
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#0#I am not a big pot roast fan, but my dad made this and gave me some and me and my husband loved it. It is now a staple in our house. Plus I LOVE how simple it is.
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#I added the potato,carrot,and onion too and this meal had amazing flavor! I will definetly be making this again!!! Thank you!
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#Wow, this is really good. My kids loved it and I shared it with co-workers who indicated their families liked it as well. i did add potatoes, onions and carrots as suggested making it a full meal. Thank you.
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#0#So I lost the packet of ranch I bought the other day; thus, I used the italian, onion soup packet, ranch in a bottle, and gravy packet. I threw half a bag of baby carrots on top, and 2 hrs later some quartered red potatoes. It was AMAZING!!! Thought I was crazy mixing ranch and italian on pot roast but don't be fooled. COMES OUT PERFECT!!! 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This is one of my favorite things to cook for my family. It's a hit every time, and smells awesome while slowly cooking in the crockpot all day! I also place onions, potatoes, and carrots in with the roast. Serve with the gravy and some fresh bread, and it's an excellent meal! 
Flavorful Pot Roast#0#0#This is outrageously good and easy. You really should try this, as all I have shared it with wind up making it more than once. Not only is the roast very flavorful it makes very good gravy as well. A WINNER!
Flavorful Pot Roast#1#0#I found this recipe to be VERY salty, with the flavor of the marinade overpowering the meat. I think I'll keep looking... -LCofNC 
Pumpkin Bread#8#0#Delicious ! I too opted to use a full can of pumpkin and skip the water. What else r u doing to do with a left over half can? I added raisins, walnuts and then topped it off with a crumble( butter, brown sugar, sugar , cinnamon and oats) Its amazing ! I even made muffins out of the second batch  
Pumpkin Bread#0#5#Such a great recipe everyone loved it.
Pumpkin Bread#14#12#I've had a pumpkin bread recipe for years and when I went to pull it out I couldn't find it. So I ran into this similar recipe after weeks of searching, Im very excited about making this for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday season this year(2021). Stay tuned and I'll let you know how it all turns out. 
Pumpkin Bread#5#1#Good recipe. I did go with the extra pumpkin and left out the water. Iffy about the raisins but went with them. Tasty addition!
Pumpkin Bread#14#9#Fantastic!!! I too omitted the water & used 1 full can of pumpkin!!
Pumpkin Bread#6#6#can this recipe be made in a bread maker?
Pumpkin Bread#47#15#Wow! This Pumpkin Bread is amazing! My husband and I couldn't stop raving about it! The only revision I made to the recipe was I used the whole can of pumpkin purée like a few other reviewers did, as not to waste the pumpkin instead of making two loaves. I also omitted using the 1/2 cup of water like the others did. I appreciate their advice, because this was magnificent and no other changes are needed. I used 1/2 cup of raisins in it which tasted perfect! This Pumpkin Bread is a keeper! Thank you, Joyce, for posting this great recipe!
Pumpkin Bread#4#0#Best recipe and like that it makes one loaf. I followed it to a T and included the walnuts and golden raisins. The hubs said it was the best pumpkin bread I have ever made.
Pumpkin Bread#9#13#Doubled this recipe to make 2 loaves. I cooked for 65 minutes, took out of oven and began to cool it. Realized that it was not done and put back into the oven. Baked for another 25 minutes and took out. Still did not seem done. Followed the recipe to a T. Do not know what happened. Maybe too much oil. Any suggestions. Will not make again.
Pumpkin Bread#9#11#absolutely the best pumpkin loaf i have ever made! these are the few small changes i made. used almost the entire can of pumpkin, 1/4 butter & 1/4 coconut oil, 1/4 cup OJ, 1tbls water, & combined several sugars, (coconut, cane & packed brn), but only 1 1/4 cups. used lots of raisins & chopped walnuts. OMG! so moist so delicious thanks to the person in NOva Scovia. next time i will double the recipe making 1 loaf & a tray of cupcakes. thank again!
Pumpkin Bread#2#0#I tripled this recipe to give as gifts for the holidays! It is so moist and flavorful! It has the perfect blend of spices! It's a keeper! 
Pumpkin Bread#6#0#Very good. I made 2 loaves to use the whole can of pumpkin. I subbed applesauce for the oil.
Pumpkin Bread#2#0#I am not a big baker, this bread was so simple. I made this for my husband's birthday, and he absolutely loved it. Moist and flavorful, he could not stop raving about it. I will definitely be making this again and again. 
Pumpkin Bread#3#0#Can I use fresh steamed and mashed pumpkin?
Pumpkin Bread#11#1#Have made this recipe for a number of years and have reduced some ingredients each time to find out what I can get away with. I've reduced the sugar and the oil by half and also the eggs to only two (sometimes only 1) .I also use up any any amount of pumpkin that I have no matter if it's only 1 cup or 2 or even a full can. Makes no difference as it always turns out delicious. 
Pumpkin Bread#6#3#Made this for the first time this evening. I did take one reviewer's advice and used the whole can of pumpkin and omitted the water. I also didn't use cloves because I don't like the flavor of them. Baked for 75 min in a glass pan and it came out perfectly. It is wonderful with a pat of butter while still warm. Will definitely make this again!
Pumpkin Bread#2#4#I love this bread. I've made double recipes all four times. Once I made it vegan which was the only time that the bread didn't fall apart and leave its bottom in the pan. Tried waiting ten minutes, tried waiting fifteen minutes. What am I doing wrong? I love to give this as presents but it looks kind of weird with the bottom coming off... 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I did this recipe and was soooo delicious!! It came out so rich and moist!! Definitely doing this again!
Pumpkin Bread#5#3#This is my first try at pumpkin bread. I looked over the reviews before starting and I'm glad I took the advice of using the whole can of pumpkin and omitting the water. It came out perfect. I used a glass bread pan and it took 65 minutes just like the recipe stated. I forgot to add walnuts. I think it would be yummy with some spreadable cream cheese. 
Pumpkin Bread#4#3#I made two loaves so i could use the whole can. One i cooked in glass pyrex and Janet is correct mine took 1h20 minutes as well. The second i baked in a metal pan and after 65 minutes it was done. This Pumkin bread remains a very dense and moist cake. We liked the flavor but will not be making this again.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#so easy and so delicious!
Pumpkin Bread#1#0#This was rich and really good. I see it was submitted by someone in Nova Scotia. I visit there a lot and EVERYTHING from Nova Scotia is delicious!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I have made pumpkin bread for a long time you can also do this in a bread machine on sweet or rapid cook.
Pumpkin Bread#2#2#I've made alot of recipes for pumpkin bread but this might be the best. Inused pecans as I was out of walnuts, no raisins but did add a bit of Cinnamon. The nutmeg and clove ratios were wonderful. Full.discloaure I used peanut oil instead of canola. It was delicious! 
Pumpkin Bread#0#3#It was okay, I agree with some users. The ingredients aren't proportional. It was way to moist. Wet almost. Unfortunate, as it is a waste of ingredients. 
Pumpkin Bread#55#2#I added just a few ounces of sarcasm and a pinch of annoyance.....This bread turned out perfectly. Baked for 65 minutes and are you ready...actually FOLLOWED THE RECIPE as written and am reviewing it as it was written. I guess I'm living on the edge or something. It was moist, delicious, and guess what...perfectly sweetened. I wondered about the 1.5 cups of sugar but figured that since I was FOLLOWING A RECIPE...I should actually I don't know...FOLLOW THE RECIPE. I highly recommend trying this and maybe even FOLLOWING THE RECIPE as written to get the best results. 
Pumpkin Bread#4#0#This is a very flexible recipe.I added about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of fresh pumpkin pure ( which I make from our jack-o-lantern and freeze) and was generous with the nuts and spices, and it came out great both times. It needs to bake for about 1 hour and 20 minutes, so just make sure you test it. yum!
Pumpkin Bread#0#2#Something in this recipe is way off with the ingredients. My bread was not all all the correct mix of ingredients.
Pumpkin Bread#1#0#I just finished making 7 of these breads plus 1 made with stevia for a diabetic friend. They were easy andcame out looking great. They smell divine so I am hoping they taste that way as well
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This was very good. I cut back on the sugar and nutmeg due to my tastes. It was very moist! Everyone loved it!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This was fantastic pumpkin bread , these should actually be referred to as cakes. Used fresh baked pumpkin, ground up the cloves and cinnamon sticks because it's all I had in hand. Used standard cane sugar and some maple syrup, and subbed all baking powder for the baking soda. Still turned out fantastic. One thing I love about this recipe is that it uses 1/2c water instead if just going for the 1 entire cup of canola oil, as less healthier recipes do. Would also try adding 1 or 2 teaspoons of vanilla next time. Forget canned pumpkin and used fresh if you can, it makes a world of difference! 
Pumpkin Bread#1#0#I've made this twice so far. It will be my go-to pumpkin bread recipe. It's a very adaptable recipe and I'll probably make it a little different each time. I'll never use 1.5C of sugar, that's for sure. Today I used 3/4th cup and it's perfectly sweet. 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Thid bread is fantastic! It is my go to recipe!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I love this recipe. I made as written many times, but the last time, I added the entire can of pumpkin, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I added chopped walnuts and put the mix into 2 smaller disposable loaf pans for sharing. It was fantastic! Great either way, but if you're looking to use up your pumpkin without doubling the recipe, it will work. I think it's more moist and has more pumpkin flavor. Great recipe. I tell everyone to use it! Thanks:) 
Pumpkin Bread#0#2#I'm disappointed. I made 2 loaves today and neither of them was cooked through to the bottom even though I left them in for longer than 70 minutes. And, it's not my oven. 
Pumpkin Bread#1#0#This bread is quick and has that perfect sweet and spice I look for in the cooler months. I used one cup fresh pumpkin instead of canned, dropped the oil down to 1/4 cup, and used 1/4 cup of milk instead of the water. Super moist and fluffy!
Pumpkin Bread#1#0#My favorite pumpkin bread I add cranraisins!
Pumpkin Bread#1#1#I enjoyed this bread a lot. It came together quickly with regard to mixing, and it baked up beautifully. I love that it is made with oil - no creaming any butter so that makes it easier to mix up. I have sometimes added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the recipe with excellent results.
Pumpkin Bread#0#1#Great loaf! Used pumpkin instead of water and used cake flour.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Great recipe. Easy to put together. Very moist.
Pumpkin Bread#1#1#This is my favorite bread to date! I doubled the recipe. I always made banana nut bread as gifts, but tried this with the whole 15 oz. can of pumpkin, skipped the water, added walnuts and raisins. Of course I had to try it, before giving it as gifts:) My husband and I loved it so much wei hit on the second loaf! which left me with only two and then I had to bake four more as gifts! Yummy!!
Pumpkin Bread#1#0#perfect pumpkin bread. use the whole can of pumpkin and skip the water. made once with butter instead of canola oil and also once with apple sauce instead of the oil. slices freeze well.
Pumpkin Bread#1#0#This is the best pumpkin bread recipe ever. I followed it to a T, except did not use walnuts or raisins, as my boyfriend does not like either of those. He keeps telling me how delicious it is. He even once referred to it as orgasmic! I find the flavor and texture absolutely perfect. I will make this again and again.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Excellent Pumpkin Bread ?¸¸.*´¯`? Added raisins only was out of walnuts.
Pumpkin Bread#1#0#This was just an AMAZING pumpkin bread recipe. I didn't even notice that you were not supposed to use the whole can of pumpkin and it turned out delicious. I added a spiced citrus glaze on top along with a few pumpkin seeds, and let me tell you that was the best decision of my life!!! 
Pumpkin Bread#1#0#I usually follow recipes to the tee but I didn't want to waste any pumpkin so I used the whole can and decided to reduce the water by half. I figured the moisture from the pumpkin would replace the water I didn't use. This bread was insanely delicious and moist. It doesn't last long in my house. I am making two loaves tonight for tomorrow's potluck Thanksgiving lunch at work! This is a definite keeper. The color of the bread is beautiful too!
Pumpkin Bread#1#0#I tweaked this recipe by cutting back on the sugar, using 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 raw sugar. Used 5 soaked figs and saved 1/2 cup of that water in place of the regular water. The figs gave added fiber without changing the flavor! I will definitely be making this again!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This will be my go to recipe from now on for pumpkin bread. I followed the directions exactly as stated and it came out perfect
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This is the BEST pumpkin loaf ever! So moist and flavourful. A keeper for sure.
Pumpkin Bread#1#0#LOVE this pumpkin bread. Read throught the reviews and made the following tweaks: oj instead of water, full can of pumpkin and dried cranberries instead of raisins. Delicious!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Absolutely delicious!! This is the only recipe I will use from now on when making pumpkin bread. I followed the directions exactly as written. Great taste, very moist. YUM, only problem, my family gobbled it up so quickly I will have to make another one.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#So took this and switched it up some, real pumpkin , not canned, cooked pumpkin (bake or microwave) , I only use real pumpkin for it is so abundant in the area I live. Pureed the pumpkin with all the wet ingredients , but used orange juice instead of water. Coconut sugar instead of white, for so many reasons, and last white choc. chips and walnuts.......I think we found a new favorite.....
Pumpkin Bread#0#2#Awesome! I used chocolate chips in place of nuts. Love it!!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This is the best pumpkin bread I've had, much better than the recipe I've always used. I added a whole can of pumpkin instead of one cup and didn't alter the b. soda or b. powder...baked up wonderfully! 
Pumpkin Bread#0#1#This is a great recipe. I cut the sugar down to one cup and used Greek yogurt in place of half the oil and it was still really good and a bit healthier.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I LOVE this recipe. It is the best pumpkin bread I have ever had.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This is a my new favorite pumpkin bread recipe. It is very moist and tastes just like pumpkin bread should taste! (I even made it with GF flour and it was still wonderful.)
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This is the BEST pumpkin bread recipe I have ever eaten! So moist and delicious! It made 2 loaves so I am excited. I will use this recipe every time! I will try it with bananas sometime since I always end up with too many uneaten bananas. Mmmmmm................................
Pumpkin Bread#0#2#Love pumpkin bread in the fall. Used choc chips instead of raisins
Pumpkin Bread#1#0#I love this recipe..very moist and delicious...this recipe makes awesome cookies too..just drop by teaspoon or tablespoon onto a cookie sheet and bake for 10 mins. Great for the upcoming holidays.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#delicious and moist pumpkin bread!!! I did not add the spices because I wanted the full pumpkin flavor and instead of raisins I used craisins and plumped them first! I winner in our house!!!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I LOVE pumpkin bread and this recipe is great! Just the right amount of pumpkin taste. I might try and do muffins the next time. I usually leave out the nuts and may try the suggestion to add cinnamon chips or butterscotch chips!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Tastes great! I doubled the recipe and used walnuts and pecans - this pumpkin bread is definitely a winner!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#very good, i used my squash instead of pumpkin. still tastes great.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Before I bake this...what size can of pumpkin
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Has anyone used fresh mashed pumpkins?
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I made these into 4 mini loaves. I used cinnamon chips and less sugar instead of raisins and walnuts. Very easy to make.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Great receipe but I found with my oven I had to bake it about 80 minutes. I baked the bread in a Pyrex glass loaf pan. Added walnuts and raisens, delicious!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Good flavor, nice spice. Mine came out overly sweet, though, for my taste and a bit heavy, not light and airy. I had dried cranberries so I used those. Next time I will try with fresh.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Fabulous! The only thing I did differently was to use two loaf pans instead of one, and bake for 50 minutes! They came out perfectly!
Pumpkin Bread#1#0#Why in the world to all you people review a recipe you make your own changes to? It is frustrating to start reading and then realize it is not based on the recipe as written. I spend more jumping on to the next one. Stick to the recipe!!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Decided to try this recipe since I had all the ingredients with the exception of the nutmeg. The family loved it and it's now my go to pumpkin bread recipe. I didn't have nutmeg, but I did have pumpkin pie spice, so I substituted that for the cinnamon and nutmeg. Also, I realized after I put the pan in the oven I forgot to add the salt, but after tasting it without the salt I think I will just leave it out in the future too. 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I use pecans instead of walnuts. But I just have to ask: what is a large small bowl? That just killed me.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Good easy to prepare.
Pumpkin Bread#1#0#This recipe is very good! I followed as is and it turned out excellent, and the smell while it's baking is even better! For those people that COMPLETELY change the recipe to suit their taste should NOT review the recipe!!! It is not a true review of the recipe! Make it AS IS then review! 
Pumpkin Bread#0#1#I've come up with a much more diabetic-friendly version of this recipe by substituting whole wheat pastry flour for the white flour, stevia for the white sugar, and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for half of the canola oil and added 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger, simply because I love the taste of ginger. No one who's tried my version has even noticed the difference, but mine has less fat, healthier carbs, no sugar and more fiber. 
Pumpkin Bread#0#1#I thought this was a very good recipe. I substituted some sour cream for some of the water and doubled the recipe to use a full can of pumpkin. I substituted brown sugar for half of the sugar and reduced the sugar by 1/4 c. I made a large loaf and 15 standard muffins.To those who changed the recipe and then it didn't work out, cooking is chemistry--change the formula and you can get unexpected results, if you don't compensate. Don't blame the recipe! 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Great recipe!!! I added a little ginger to it. Now. I'm embarrassed to admit this but I totally forgot about the oil. And..... The bread turned out just fine!!! It tasted amazing. I didn't realize I forgot it until I had already eaten some. Calories saved by this mistake: 480 cal, 52 grams of fat. so I had two loaves. Which means that if you break it into 8ths, you save 3 grams of fat per serving. 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Best pumpkin bread I ever had. Add 2-3 tbsp extra flour. I also added walnuts and pecans....yum
Pumpkin Bread#1#0#I use golden raisins which I boil in the water called for in the recipe. Use a little extra for boil off. Then roll the raisins in flour(not too much) and fold in to batter. They will not be chewy. They will be delicious and they will not go to bottom of pan and burn.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Like others, I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for the 1/2 cup water. I substituted ground ginger for the nutmeg since my family won't eat anything with nutmeg. Left out the raisins since one son won't eat raisins. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Whole family raved about it being the best pumpkin bread ever, and it disappeared in record time. Moist from beginning to end, and delicious, delicious, delicious. 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This is one recipe that my kids love. I reduce the amount of sugar to 3/4 of a cup and add 2-3 bananas each time I make this recipe. I also decrease the oil to 1/4 cup. I bake it for about 75 minutes. It is a family favorite!!!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Made lots of alterations. Used pecans instead of walnuts. More cinnamon, and less sugar. Also added 1 tsp. cardamon. I also decreased the oil and used applesauce instead and instead of water, I used milk.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Love this recipe!!!! I added pecan instead of walnuts. Thought the pecans would give it a better flavor instead of walnuts. So good. :-)
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Wow came out great! Doubled the recipe, added 1/2 cup applesauce to can pumpkin to make 2 cups. Only used 3 eggs, half applesauce half coconut oil in place of canola, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white, total half cup soy milk in place of the water, streusel on top baked 75 minutes
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I absolutely LOVED this recipe! I surprisingly ran out of oil, so I improvised. I instead used ONLY 1/4 cup oil and 1 cup almond milk. I reduced the liquids because I also added 1/2 cup more pumpkin to the loaf.I have baked this recipe both ways and fell equally! This has by far been the best pumpkin bread I have baked.*Note: The best way to keep your bread moist is to turn off the oven when you are a couple minutes from being fully done and letting the pumpkin bread cook slowly for about 5-10 minutes in the turned off oven! Make sure to cover snugly once the pan is cool enough to grab or else it will dry out! Thank you so much for the recipe!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Moist, tender and tasty. I followed the recipe as it stated except I used 1/2 amount of sugar. It turned out just the way we liked it. Thanks for sharing.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I had to make this with all purpose gluten free flour with xanthan gum and it was still so moist and flavorful. I'm making another loaf today! 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I made this recipe for a reception and every piece went. The loaf I kept at home didn't last that much longer. Delicious! I did substitute orange/pineapple juice for the water. I'm making again tonight with the leftover pumpkin from the first recipe. 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This was an amazing easy recipe to follow; I did bake mine in my longer/thinner bread pan (13 X 4 1/2) and was done in an hour. For the pumpkin I used leftover mashed sweet potatoes and also added the raisins. This is a'keeper recipe' ! Yum... 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Didn't last a day at my house! Excellent recipe! 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I'm glad I finally found an excellent recipe for pumpkin bread that has some spice to it. I saw some cans of pumpkin in my pantry and decided to try this. My husband LOVED it! In fact, after only one day, it is gone! I plan to make some of these for my relatives for Christmas. The only things added were a little brown sugar on top and some additional walnuts! Yum! This recipe is definitely a keeper! 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#With 78 of the 87 respondents giving this recipe a 5 Star rating I took the plunge and made a double batch without ever trying the recipe out. What good is half a can of pumpkin puree, right? Unless you make a smoothie and I've already had my breakfast. I've got just over an hour before my first tasting........Yes! This definitely is 5 Star Pumpkin Bread and I think it's way better than StarBuck's version!FYI I omitted raisins and walnuts. The next time I make it, which will be later today, I will add some topping, just like StarBucks. I'm going to bring some to share for the holiday this week and freeze a couple to have on hand. I will add some walnuts to one of the next two loaves I make. I used two different bread pans: one dark metal and one glass. The metal one took longer to bake in the center. I set the timer for 60 minutes as I always go under with my oven and the one in glass pan was not ready. I gave it an extra 10 minutes, which was only 5 minutes more than the recommended baking time. 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#The center of my loaf wasn't completely cooked until 1 hour 35 minutes. Even though I foiled the edges, my loaf still turned out very dark with a slight burnt flavor. Nonetheless, the bread remained moist. I substituted raisins with chocolate chips. Not terribly impressed with this recipe. 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This is delicious! I've made half a dozen loaves in the past month; I have a houseful of pumpkin anything fans. Better than Starbucks! Don't get the bad review, something was off, maybe the oven? Mine's turned out perfectly every time. 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Moist, Delicious,and Easy! Made per recipe except left out the nuts and raisins. Loved it!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Terrible! Never cooked through even after 2 hours. I checked to make sure I had added all ingredients correctly. So sad!!! It had such good reviews.... The part that did cook was super bland!! I will definitely be trying another recipe.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Very easy and is really good
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#fantastic I added 1/2 cup baby oatmeal to it
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Very delicious and moist, I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and used chocolate chips instead of raisins.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Delicious! Very moist and flavorful. This is my favorite pumpkin bread for our family.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Amazingly moist! I love this recipe. Very moist and melt in your mouth. I will only make this from now on ! Fantastic!!!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I highly recommends sifting the flour, doubled the pumpkin amount and the cinnamon and used dried cranberries and added no oil.One of my best breads I ever made it was so delicious and moist, I also used a Bundt pan instead of a loaf and baked 75 mins on 350. Yum!!!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Made the pumpkin bread for my son. Easy to make, moist, and spicy !!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Best pumpkin bread ever!! Just made some, added the walnuts and raisins and turned out great ....
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Love it
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#The best pumpkin bread recipe to be found! I substituted half the sugar with Splenda and it turned out just fine. Use applesauce for the oil to make it even healthier. My family loves it!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#It was good, particularly when I added some mini chocolate chips!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Followed the recipe except for no nuts or raisins... and I use my own home-ground whole-wheat flour. I baked the batter in mini bundt pans for 30 mins (+ or -) and they turned out really good. I plan to drizzle with some flat icing and give out as little gifts, with a packet of instant hot cider mix. (neighbors, mailman, meter reader, etc.)
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I loved this recipe, and so did my family and friends. The only adjustments I made was I used the pumpkin that I canned myself and I used pecans instead of walnuts with no raisins. Everyone asked for a copy of this recipe! It is very moist and flavorful !
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I thought this would be very good but to me just ehhh ok not a bread texture but more like cake and kinda dry I allways make the pumpkin spice bread from here it is very good now that's good pumpkin bread but I sometimes add nuts and raisins but will not make this again i just don't get all the good reviews taste not that good to me just a waste gonna make the pumpkin spice bread and stick to that been making that for years so moist and delicious 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This is a very good bread. I did make a few changes to try to make it healthier. I used Splenda instead of sugar. I used one egg, and one serving of egg beaters. I used one cup of all purpose flour, and 2/3 cup of whole wheat flour. I also halved the oil, and added 1/4 cup of water blended with one whole orange, (pureed), in place of some of the oil. Also I added one teaspoon of maple extract. It turned out moist and very tasty.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#So moist and delicious! The kids and I loved it! Did not add the walnuts or raisins. Had to foil the edges so they wouldn't burn while the middle was still cooking. 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This turned out yummy! I was out of nutmeg so I will add it next time.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This is a great recipe. I swapped the flour for gluten free flours, and used some sour milk I happened to have instead of the water, chocolate chips instead of raisins. What a treat!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I have never made pumpkin bread before, but decided to try it because the reviews were so good! I used my own fresh mashed pumpkin, and added chocolate chips instead of the walnuts/raisins, it is SO delicious!! Tons of flavour.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I love pumpkin bread and have tried a lot of different recipes and this is by far the best one ever.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Easy, simple recipe. Moist and delicious. I used 1/2 cup less sugar...perfect sweetness.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#P.S. I also used a little less flour- right around 1 1/2 c. ;-)
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Great bread, I don't think you can mess it up! I had a hankerin' for pumpkin bread and went to go make some and realized I'd used the last eggs for breakfast. So, didn't use eggs, didn't want raisins, and no walnuts and I added 1/2 t. more cinnamon and used Vietnamese cinnamon. It was STILL delicious! 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#this was just great!!! exactly what I wanted. I used to make one but lost recipe and now this one will be my go-to . next time I am going to add the optional raisins as we like them. can;t get any better. My husband said he pays for a slice at the coffee shop and mine was better!!!! 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Easy to make and tasted really nice. Kids loved it too. I did substitute 1/3 cup of the flour with oat flour (finely ground oats) and 1/2 cup bittersweet chocolate chips instead of the nuts/raisins. It made 3 mini-loaves which were baked in about 35 minutes.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#So easy and delicious! The recipe is right on for a perfect loaf of bread
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This recipe is divine! For a long time I tried to replicate a delicious but overpriced pumpkin bread at my local supermarket-this is it! I do add a cinnamon glaze to improve the appearance and keep it moist.Thanks Joyce!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Made into mini loaves as gifts - baked the mini loaves at 350 for 35 minutes. Left out walnuts and raisins, but topped with powdered sugar. This bread is really delicious and tastes like Autumn.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#this is so AWESOME!!!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I add raisins and craisins..my kids love it.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This is now my favorite pumpkin bread recipe. So quick and easy too! Love it.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#wonderful bread! It overflowed the pan just a little. I might make 2 smaller loafs next time.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Great flavor - everyone loved it! I'll be making it again real soon. 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I'm not an experienced baker but I think I should have added some flour since I am at higher altitude. :) 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Absolutely delicious!! I sprinkled a little powdered sugar on top, and it is perfect!!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Also.... a real crowd pleaser! Everyone was raving over it!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#A perfect fall day recipe! Went straight in the recipe box!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This is so YUMMY! I used real pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin and I did not put in the raisins. I will definitely be making this one again and again!!!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#The best pumpkin bread I have ever made. A Quick and easy recipe. Thank you for sharing :)
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Wonderfully tasty, moist with wonderful Fall flavour, this bread is simply amazing! I will definitely make this again!*You can substitute the sugar with granulated baking Splenda(tm) cup for cup. I made it with Splenda for my mother-in-law, a borderline diabetic, and it tasted wonderful!*
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This bread is so moist. I added cranberries to it instead of raisens. It was such a hit.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I love this bread ... even people who say they dont like pumpkin, love this bread . I dont put in raisins.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I love this bread. I first tried this recipe last fall and made it several times through the holidays. I add mini chocolate chips which is very tasty. I made mini loaves and froze them and pulled them out when needed to give as tasty gifts. One batch makes 4 mini loaves. Another great recipe.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Very good! I did not add the walnuts or raisins but it was still yummy ;)
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Simply delicious! I skipped the raisins and walnuts but it was still moist and yummy.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#The only thing I changed ;rice flour for the all purpose1/8 t of clovesMy family is allergic to wheat so this works out very well.. My family loves this and gets excited when I make it..
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I tried two different pumpkin bread recipes from this site over Christma & this was the best by far. Really, really good.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This is a very moist delicious bread. My husband loves it and I will definitely make it again.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This is delicious -- it has a perfect texture. I'll definitely make this recipe again. 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Just made this and turned out amazing! First time I have ever made pumpkin bread and so good!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Easy to make, super moist and delicious!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I'm not usually a fan of anything pumpkin, BUT I loved this bread. I put it in 2 loaf pans. It turned out perfectly. YUM! 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Great flavor and so moist! Didn't use nuts or raisins and it was delish! 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#It was great!! I even froze a loaf and it was so moist after I thawed it. I am going to make more and do mini loafs for Christmas.Thanks-
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I was looking for a good pumpkin bread recipe and this was it. It was very moist and didn't last long . I will make it again and will bring it to Thanksgiving dinner this year. 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This is such a moist bread, you can't just have one slice! I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the batter and my co-workers devoured the whole loaf yesterday. I've made 3 loaves of this bread this week. Definitely a keeper! 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Thank you SO MUCH for this recipe!! I had never made a pumpkin bread before and this was absolutely wonderful!! It is very moist and delicious. I put in the walnuts & raisins and cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was still sweet enough. Even my husband ( who doesn't usually like ANYTHING pumpkin) really liked this! 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Excellent bread: easy and quick to make.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This is delicious! I didn't add the nutmeg or cloves (none on hand) but did add raisins. 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#The BEST pumpkin bread recipe I've found yet! So moist and flavorful. -Lori in WI. 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This bread was so delicious and moist! I think I used chopped pecans in my first batch and we didn't really like them. Next time I may try another nut or just leave them off entirely. I also added some nutmeg and cloves to bring out some of the flavor, and next time I may add more pumpkin spice, nutmet and cloves next time to see if it helps bring out the flavor. Other than that, this was a GREAT recipe that I will be making again in the fall! 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I just got done making this bread for 7 different families for Christmas! They absolutely loved it! I baked a loaf yesterday for myself and I will have to say half of the loaf is already gone! Excellent bread! I'm sure I will be making this one many more times to come! 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Don't mess with perfection. if you are looking for a really good Christmas bread or anytime, this takes 1st place. i did omit raisons and nuts as I don't want any other flavors interfering with my pumpkin. Even the ends are good and was not as oily as other recipes I've tried. 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Made one batch with golden raisins and one batch plain. I used applesauce instead of oil, but that's the only change I made. These came out delicious, especially with the raisins! 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This is a great recipe, I used one teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice in place of the other seasonings and probably should have used a little more but it is really good.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Very good recipe. I make it without nuts or raisins, for picky family members. It was very flavorful and just the right texture. Yum. (I may have added just a tiny smidge more cloves than called for -- it's a flavor I love.) 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#what a great recipe. i made today for my friend's baby shower and everyone loved it. i used a 9-in. x 13-in. pan and cut it in squares. i'll be making it for the up coming holidays! :) 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Moist and tasty. Also made another version of the same recipe, omitting water and subbing orange juice and rind. Replaced the raisins and nuts with frozen and dried cranberries. Definitely a pair of keepers.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I made this today was very moist tasted great easy to do would make again.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Doubled the recipe and made 2 big loaves. It was really delicious. I will definately make it again as is and also make it with mini chocolate chips and pecans. Very moist, great texture, not too oily.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#this sounds delish. i like the pineapple suggestion, do you use tidbits, drained for that? i will be making this next time i can get ome pumpkin at the store. yumm
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#Omit the raisins and add a large bag of milk chocolate chips. A big hit with my family.
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This recipe is so easy and delicious! I made it without the raisins but the pumpkin nut was a hit in my house. Great Recipe!
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#I made this last night. I followed the directions and made no changes. It is so moist and delicious. Used both raisins and nuts. It's super simple to make also. You don't even need to get out your electric mixer. I'll make this again for sure. 
Pumpkin Bread#0#0#This was a very moist bread. I made 3 loaves, one with hazelnuts, one with pineapple and one with hazelnuts and golden raisins. The pineapple won hands down.
Taco Lasagna#3#7#I'm doing this but using lasagna noodles and red enchilada sauce 
Taco Lasagna#16#2#I made this with corn tortillas (you need a few more since they're smaller). My family loved it! It even reheated well in the microwave. This is going in the easy, fast, good recipes book. 
Taco Lasagna#1#122#Maybe I'm a little prejudiced but I have trouble trusting a recipe that uses a spice MIX. What's up with that? How difficut is it to shake out the cumin and corriander? 
Taco Lasagna#6#0#On rotation frequently for dinner meals. Family really enjoys it
Taco Lasagna#42#0#With only 2 of us at home now, I make this using 2 round cake pans. The first one is perfect for us for a couple days, and the second goes in the freezer for next time!
Taco Lasagna#17#0#This was so good! The only change I made was use a bag of frozen peppers and onions because I didn't have fresh. My son and I loved it! Thank you! 
Taco Lasagna#16#1#This is THE BEST recipe for Taco Lasagna!!! Its EASY and a lot less time consuming than other recipes!! I've made this recipe at least 20 times and it always turns out Great. You an freeze it after making it or after it's been cooked. Great for pot lucks or taking to someone in need . Try it, you WILL love it!!! I serve mine with toppings of chopped fresh tomatoes, salsa and shredded lettuce. 
Taco Lasagna#8#1#This recipe is a staple. I'm in Texas and we still love it! :) I use plant-based meat substitute but otherwise follow the recipe. Very tasty and a crowd pleaser. 
Taco Lasagna#7#0#I have made this recipe numerous times. I use more ground beef, usually 1 & 1/2 lbs and more cheese. Everyone always raves about this dish.
Taco Lasagna#6#1#Had this tonight and everyone loved it. Delicious! This recipe is a keeper! (Made my own Taco seasoning)
Taco Lasagna#9#0#Made this for dinner last night, and the family loved it. I used corn tortillas instead of flour. I used sweet yellow and red peppers (had on hand). I doubled the recipe, and so didn't use refried beans, since two cans of black beans were in it. I also added black olives (my mom loves olives). Will make it again for sure. 
Taco Lasagna#3#0#This was a big hit in my house! Everyone loved it. I served with sour cream and salsa. It's a keeper recipe! I will definitely make again. Great Flavor! Thanks for sharing! 
Taco Lasagna#5#2#This was really easy and quite tasty! I did use a few more tortillas (three per layer) and used 1lb of turkey and 1/2 lb of ground beef. Also, no black beans or green pepper on hand, so I doubled the refried beans. Topped with shredded lettuce and sour cream.....YUM!
Taco Lasagna#2#0#My family and I enjoyed this very much. I used a round deep dish and tortillas about the same size. I prefer drained, mashed pintos instead of retried beans. I don't care for tomato chunks so I puréed the canned Mexican flavored diced tomatoes. Added a can of diced green chilies as well to the meat mixture. My husband felt like it needed more tortillas than the three used for the layers. I might try doubling next time. I used to make something similar that had Fritos in it... he wants me to add some next time! Served with Sour Cream and Guacamole, it was yummy!
Taco Lasagna#6#1#I made this two days ago and it's a KEEPER for sure. I put a four ounce can of mild chiles in it. I would have preferred hot chiles but my husband didn't. It was very easy to make and it didn't take long bake. We have been eating it for the last three days and I not one for left-overs. Every day when we heated it up the aroma was wonderful. my husband raved about it and when he finished eating he told me he loved me. Make this recipe!, I will. Thank-you Thank-you! Jennifer 
Taco Lasagna#1#8#It was very tasty but hard to cut into portions. My husband said he'd prefer it if I made the filling and gave him the tortillas and cheese so he could make tacos with it. That would solve the cutting problem. It is really just a big taco in a dish.
Taco Lasagna#4#1#Recipe was easy. Lasagna was amazing. I substitute brown rice in instead of the beans and it was still good. Will be making again.
Taco Lasagna#2#2#Very good! I like corn tortillas and from past experiences I know flour tortillas get mushy, so I used corn. I also added sliced olives and used the onion a little...... it is a easy meal to make to Your taste, I will make this again
Taco Lasagna#3#0#This dish has become a frequent dinner in my house hold. My kids and husband love it.
Taco Lasagna#3#1#Since there's just my husband and I, what I love about this recipe is the ability to halve it. I prep the entire filling ingredients and either freeze it in two parts or use a half for that evening's meal. I've made it with both chicken and 90%/10% ground beef and the chicken is our favorite. We returned from visiting family for Thanksgiving and I plucked out the zip-lock bag of filling and it's in the oven right now, smelling so good. We dollop on some sour cream and the hubster likes hot sauce for extra zing. I have this recipe saved to my iPad home screen for quick reference. Great creation!! 
Taco Lasagna#2#3#Fallowed direction, then added my own twist. Easier to make own taco seasoning, then added pinch of brown sugar and about teaspoon ancho chili spice. Used ground turkey and corn tortillas. Flour tortillas end up as mosh for left overs. Thanks for other comments, made me realize it's a good go to recipe. 
Taco Lasagna#2#0#I've been making this for many years. My husband and I love it. Perfect as is. You can add toppings as you would to a taco. Delicious! 
Taco Lasagna#1#2#As written, this is just ok to m fairly good. But not 5 stars for my taste. It is Similar to mine except for a 9x13 pan I use Almost 2x the beef,
Taco Lasagna#1#0#Awesome!! Outstanding!!! Chopped up some jalape?o and added to half since wife can't handle the heat. Plan to add nibblet corn next time to try something a little different. Definitely a new family favorite. 
Taco Lasagna#1#0#This recipe is so YUMMY and easy to make. Absolutely LOVED it!! Will make this many more times for sure.
Taco Lasagna#1#1#Made this tonight and had a tastey dinner. I altered just a little by adding more hamburger (thus more seasoning. However I only had 1 pkt of taco seasoning so I used what I had on hand, 1 pkt fajita seasoning. It came out good. I also added crushed corn chips, sliced avacado, banana peppers, & cilantro. YUM! I finished it by adding fat free sour cream & shredded lettuce when served.
Taco Lasagna#1#0#Very, very, good! My family loved it!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!
Taco Lasagna#1#0#Yummy! Cut the corn tortillas in half and place the cut sides to the edges of the dish and then fill the center with one cut half. As others have suggested, I also heat the refried beans and mix in with the meat mixture. Because my DH requires a low sodium diet, I use my own taco seasoning recipe, salt free canned tomatoes or my own canned tomatoes and add chopped jalepeno pepper. This is one of my best potluck recipes.
Taco Lasagna#1#0#Excellent recipe! Easy enough for kids to help.
Taco Lasagna#0#1#Excellent recipe! The second time we made it before serving we topped it with a generous amount of chopped lettuce & diced tomatoes the topped with some sour cream. Have made several times always a big hit.
Taco Lasagna#1#2#Great recipe! The first time I made it, I followed the recipe. Excellent. Made it again, but added an additional taco seasoning packet and a can of corn (and upped the cheese to 4 cups). Even better. Used two 8-inch round pans, and had enough left over to make a handful of burritos. A definite winner!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#I've tried a few recipes, this one is the best! The retried beans made it! I didn't change a thing.
Taco Lasagna#1#0#This recipe is great with either flour or corn tortillas and in my own opinion is even better topped with fresh chopped lettuce and tomatoes.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#I made this exactly as posted several times and just loved it! I've started having to watch my cholesterol intake since then so made these changes. I used ground turkey and multi-grain tortillas along with lo-fat cheese and sour cream. Having picked up refried black beans by mistake, I went ahead and dumped it in. I swear, it tasted just as good as the original recipe. I love when that happens! 
Taco Lasagna#1#1#I tried this last night and was impressed! This recipe is a keeper! I omitted the refried beans because my daughter absolutely hates them, and left out the green pepper cuz I'm not a fan. Also substituted corn tortillas for regular tortillas because my husband is severely allergic to gluten, but did the rest as described and we loved it!!! Will definitely make this again!!! 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This recipe is great. I prepared it as written. I was amazed at how easy the whole dish went together. I couldn't find Mexican tomatoes so I used diced tomatoes with green chilies. My Grandson and his friends were having a gathering and they ALL loved it. I did use more cheese, like 3 - 8oz. packages. Next time, and there will be a next time, I think I will cut the tortillas in strips, as 1 reviewer did, as it was a bit difficult cutting portions. 
Taco Lasagna#0#1#Try it with chili beans and use their sauce.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Made this last night only one word describes the casserole delicious . The only thing I did was at 1/2 Italian sausage and 1/2 ground turkey because that is what I had. This is a keeper!! 
Taco Lasagna#0#1#Very quick and easy. Used ingredients I always have on hand. Very tasty I was going to cut the recipe down for 2 so instead of two cans of beans I used refried black beans.
Taco Lasagna#1#0#My kids picked around the beans and the tomatoes... essentially leaving tacos... I may make this one again. I enjoyed the flavor but it was too close to regular tacos to justify the extra time and pans required.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#So easy and so delicious! I used corn tortillas and put it under the broiler for 2 minute at the end to make the cheesy tortillas nice and crisp!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#So easy to prepare. I used 1.5 lbs of beef. Absolutely delicious. Whole family enjoyed it. Some was even taken to the girlfriends house.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Fabulous! Make it just as it it's written. It needs no changes. Everyone in my family loves this and it's a nice change from tacos! 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#we liked this but i left out the black beans. it was a good meal and we had lots leftover. would cut recipe in half next time
Taco Lasagna#2#2#I use Newmans Own salsa ( far superior in taste ...be careful it has lots of varities like peach or pineapple that do not go with this.) Try medium. Not too hot and definately more flavor than tomatoes. About the sodium content by I reviewer. Try making your own . There are Lots of recipes online but basically 1 T. Each :cumin, chilli powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and a scant TOregano. (1/4t. salt is optional. ) I round up the cumin just a bit and go a bit scant one the chili powder .But a mix of regular and chipolte chilli powder is good too. That will taste just like the envelope or BETTER according to reviews Plus no sodium. Also look for fat free refried beans... 85 % lean or ground turkey (needs a tad more seasoning) lowers the fat. These swaps do not chang the flavor at all. ADD in stuff include corn., jalapenos . Olives. . Once I topped it with crushed hard taco shells.I also cut the tortillas into 3 strips to look like lasagna noodles. It cuts easier too. 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This recipe was good. I made a few changes for my family. We don't care for black beans, so I omitted them. Fast , easy & yummy 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This is super easy to put together, and fabulously delicious! I found this to be perfectly flavorful, especially topped with your favorite toppings like taco sauce, salsa, salsa verde, sour cream, chopped fresh cilantro, however you like to dress up your tacos. I wasn't sure what the recipe meant by Mexican Diced Tomatoes, but by the size of the can it calls for, I knew it wasn't Rotel, although it would probably be fine. I used Red Gold Petite Diced Tomatoes with Lime Juice and Cilantro, which is located with all the other kinds of canned diced tomatoes, and it worked out very well. This makes a lot, but don't worry, it reheats really well. 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#We loved this--I doubled the ground beef and added some frozen corn.
Taco Lasagna#2#0#I think this would be great with polenta slices instead of the tortillas
Taco Lasagna#0#0#I made this tonight. I left out the refried beans. Also.the last two top torilas so only needed 4. Didn't need as much cheese as recipe calls for. Only used 2 1/2 cups or less. 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Excellent... love it, and so does everybody else!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#I froze half a lasagna as one was too large for my hubby and me. took out of freezer defrosted at room temp and warmed in a low oven BUT found the topping noodle very crispy anddry kind of ruined the taste how do I reheat frozen lasagna keeping soft and juicy?
Taco Lasagna#1#0#I have been making this recipe for years now and have shared with many others. I follow the recipe as is, but use pinto beans instead of black beans. Also at times, I will use Mexican Chihuahua cheese. This is certainly a household favorite in our family !
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Easy recipe, quick to prepare. My 3 year old loves it! I made the following tweaks: used fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned, added black olives, omitted the onion, & served with a dollop of sour cream on top. This recipe is now requested a couple of times a month in my house! Great alternative to the basic taco.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#So simple and so delicious. I didn't have green peppers, so I used tomatoes and green chiles. After baking, I added sour cream, lettuce, and taco sauce. The next time I make it, I will probably add more cheese, a little more taco seasoning, and corn. Very good! 
Taco Lasagna#4#0#Why is there always someone that has to comment on sodiumm/ nutritional value? Chances are that if a person is making any of these recipes, they are an adult. I'm pretty sure that everyone is capable of making their own decision as to whether or not they want to eat something. Mind your own business! People look at these reviews to read about what others thought of the recipe when they made it. The nutritional information is posted for everyone to see if that is a concern for them. 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles and a can of diced tomatoes
Taco Lasagna#0#6#Very tasty, but it has well over 1/2 of a person's daily requirement of sodium. I would avoid eating this except is VERY small amounts. 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#People ask for the recipe when I fix this dish. Everyone is surprised that it is so easy to prepare. We all love it!!
Taco Lasagna#1#0#I made this tonight for dinner and it was AWESOME!!!!! My husband said I had better not lose this recipe, he absolutely loved it. I also added corn and a little extra taco seasoning and more cheese.This will for sure be one of my new go to meals. 
Taco Lasagna#1#1#Delicious and I like how this recipe can be customized to satisfy your own unique tastes. To the meat mixture I added corn, chopped green olives, and a couple teaspoons of lime juice. Lots of extra cheese on the layers! Top it all off with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, sour cream, jalapenos, corn chips, avocados. ..to name just a few. To those who commented that the refried beans are too hard to spread: heat the refried beans in the microwave first and the consistency will soften for easier spreading. Make sure you cover the dish before baking so it doesn't dry out or get too crispy. Enjoy 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This was great! I didn't have green peppers, so I omitted them, but it was still great. Pretty simple to make too. 
Taco Lasagna#0#6#I do not recall ever seeing beans used in tacos or lasagna
Taco Lasagna#0#0#I've been making this recipe for several years now, and my husband just loves it! We make it as specified in the recipe, and think it is amazing! 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#My family loves it just the way it is.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Great base recipe to easily exchange to make it for your own family.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This is delicious, easy to play around with and vary it, I never make it the same way twice. I always add more cheese than it calls for and put in 3 or 4 minced fresh Serrano peppers. Like others mentioned I usually swap out the flour tortillas for corn. It makes enough for the 2 of us each to have a good hearty serving 2 nights in a row. This is one of those satisfying comfort foods that really fill you up and put you in that wonderful food coma right after eating.
Taco Lasagna#1#0#I used 2 cans of black beans and omitted the refried beans. I exchanged corn tortillas for flour and increased the cheese to 4 cups. Instead of a 14.5 oz. can of tomatoes, try using two cans (10 oz. each) of Ro-Tel tomatoes.
Taco Lasagna#1#0#I have made this a few times. The first time I made this my 8 and 10 yr olds looked at it and were hesitant. Since then, they have requested it when we make our weekly menus. I also mixed the refried beans with the meat mixture because otherwise the beans are thick and a pain to spread. My 10 year old son did 90% of the work the last time I made this and it is not typical that my kids request leftovers the next day, but they do for this.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This was so easy and delicious! I also mixed the refried beans into the meat mixture for easier assembly and it was fantastic. Everyone loved it. I served with lettuce, tomato, salsa and sour cream for people to add as they wished.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Make this so often for potlucks. Dont always use the black beans.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This was delicious! I used shredded chicken and corn tortillas and added jalapenos. Topped with lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro, avocado, jalapenos and sour cream. Kids loved it too.
Taco Lasagna#0#1#This a very good recipe. I made my own refried beans which is better than the canned. My husband loves tex-mex and Mexican food, so this will be made again soon. I added some shredded lettuce and sour cream on top once it was platted. Very good!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Everyone raved about this dish. I will make it again soon.
Taco Lasagna#1#0#Great quick recipe! I mixed the retried beans in with the meat and black beans to make it easier to assemble. I also added fresh corn which I cut off the cob. Great recipe for a weeknight!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Good recipe. i loved the black beans in it.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Good recipe. To reduce the amount of fat, I used fat free refried beans and non-dairy cheese . I also used corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas. Fat free tortillas can also be used to reduce the fat even further. 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#My family is crazy for this. I add sliced or chopped black olives with the cheese on top.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Yummy! I made it ahead of time and when I warmed it up in the oven, I think I had it in there for too long, as it just turned into slop, but it tasted so good! I'll make this again! 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#very good
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This recipe tasted great. The flavors really come together and I believe kids would really like it. I am only giving it four stars because between them chopping, browning and baking, this recipe takes at least 40 minutes to prepare.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#I prefer to use corn tortillas (the flour ones' get soggy ) I also use poblano or anaheim pepper (don't care for the bell pepper family)also added can of sliced black olive can of corn and can diced green chiles 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Has a really good taste. I did change it a bit by putting the refried beans in with the meat mixture, just much easier. Also added lettuce, tomatoes, taco sauce & sour cream on top. Will put in my keeper list.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Great, easy dinner for the whole family to enjoy.
Taco Lasagna#0#2#Family favorite! I have made this with both beef and chicken. I also add a half of a can of corn and a half can of diced green chilies. I prefer to use organic whole grain white corn tortillas and sometimes I skip the last layer of tortilla altogether, as well as one of the cheese layers. Cutting a layer of tortillas and a third of the cheese does nothing to reduce the taste. Serve with tossed salad and corn bread. So good!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Made this last night & got good reviews from the family. Not spicy at all. Think I will add black olives the next time to see how that changes the flavor.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Great recipe. You can change it up according to what you have--cooked chicken instead of hamburger, etc. Once I used hummus instead of refried beans, as I didn't have any on hand. Hummus was great too. I also put olives in the layers. Corn is good too--anything works. 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Very tasty!
Taco Lasagna#0#1#Sounds delicious. How many carbs per serving please. Lots of diabetics in my family and we have to court carbs.
Taco Lasagna#0#1#this sound & looks Delish...i am going to try this
Taco Lasagna#0#1#This recipe is delicious!! I made a few substitutions: lean ground turkey, low sodium black beans, lowfat ricotta cheese (no refried beans), whole wheat tortillas and lowfat cheese. I had to cook it a little longer; 30 minutes covered and 10-15 minutes uncovered- I like my tortillas crispy.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#My family loved this and that is all I needed to know. You can make all types of variations with this. My husband added sour cream to his second serving. I liked when the tortillas were crispy. A complete favorite in my home. The kids said, Add this to your recipe box! 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This was super and quick. We thought that it was full of flavor and so easy.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#it does make the outer edge of the casserole , bit crispy on the tortillas when bake for 30 minutes. But it is a great time saving recipe ,if you need dinner on the table fast. if you like southwestern food it would be a good recipe to try out, I just suggest baking it for 20 or 25 minutes any longer the outer edges of the tortilla will be to crispy.
Taco Lasagna#3#0#Wow! What can I say! I submitted this recipe 12 years ago on a whim and it won me $500.00 and a feature in Quick Cooking. I am so excited to see everyones' reviews and modifications. I am married now and my family loves this recipe too! Crazy to see 86 reviews written! Who knew! 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This is delicious!!! I did add extra cheese (I love cheese!) I added chopped roma tomatoes, sliced black olives and sour cream to the top when serving. I think I will add chopped green onions the next time. Love this and my husband loved it!! I'm glad to see that it warms up good! Will definitely make again. 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Very good!! I served it with sour cream and that's tops it off to great! I changed the original recipe: ground turkey breast, canned diced tomatoes, canned green chiles, added Mexicorn, used La tortilla Factory tortillas, FF refried beans and 16 ounces (vs12) cheese. I baked @375º for 30 minutes covered, then uncovered and baked for another 30 minutes. The top got nice and crispy. So good and would serve 12. 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This was pretty good but not a favorite as far as Mexican lasagnas go. My family likes the other one I make better. 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#My mom made this for us and it was delicious, good as leftovers the next day also. She used red beans instead of black beans and she also served it with sour cream. I loved the refried beans in there. This is definitely a keeper!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#I am not a bean lover but this was really really good. I went a little lighter on the refried beans and it was awesome! And I used salsa instead of diced tomatoes. Love it!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#LOVED this one. Except I left out the refried beans and mexican style tomatoes. Instead I used Fire Roasted Tomatoes, shredded lettuce, and added in Salsa. Top with sour cream. This one is to die for. I plan to make this again next week!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This was easy to make and it came out really good!!! My husband ate 1/2 the taco lasagna in 1 sitting. Adding a little sour cream to each serving is delicious!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This is a keeper! Easy and delicious!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#I tryed this and it was very good . added my home grown green peppers bigger chunks
Taco Lasagna#0#1#I have made this recipe several times, and it's a winner every time!!! I do like to add a dollop of sour cream on top when serving this. I also use a tad more ground beef and cheese than called for. Simple, easy, you can't go wrong!!!! 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#I made this recipe exactly as written and mine came out much drier I think it should have. We were really disappointed in it the first night. The second night I served with sour cream and enchilada sauce and it was much better but still not something that I would make it again. IF I did make it again I would make some changes one of which would be to incorporate the sour cream and the enchilada sauce into the layers. I would liked to have given this 2 ½ stars. It was not awful so I did not want to give it 2 stars just not that special. It does make a lot.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#We added black olives to this...
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Made this for dinner tonight. Whole family loved it. However, I made a few changes right off the bat. My current changes were: I used whole wheat flour tortillas, venison burger (about 1 1/2 pounds), TWO packets of taco seasoning. 4 cups (2- 8oz bags) of shredded Mexican cheese. We also added sour cream and guacamole as a garnish.Things I will do differently next time I make it: I will use sliced GREEN onions in beef mixture AND as a garnish. I will use a tub of fresh salsa instead of Mexican diced tomatoes, and when I do that I will delete the 2/3 cup water, because fresh salsa has way more juice than a can of diced tomatoes. And I would definitely break up the top layer of tortilla's and spread them evenly, cuz those were tough to cut. I had to perforate them with a sharp knife to get an even cut. Even sprinkled with cheese and baked they were not soft enough to cut pieces with the spatula.Other than my changes, this was an awesome first time recipe for us and we liked it! 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This is one of my favorite dinner recipes! It is so easy to assemble and so yummy! I add some frozen corn to the beef mixture, and serve it with lettuce and jalapeño -- yum!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Very good dish! I made 1/2 recipe, but I did not cut the beef in half. I replaced the green pepper with 1/2 can of green chiles, and I used sharp cheddar cheese. I also used brown rice tortillas as one person does not eat wheat. I may try corn tortillas next time. This is a good recipe. Thanks for sharing it.
Taco Lasagna#1#0#I made this last night and it was fantastic. Usually when I've made a new dish, I'll ask my husband if he likes it and he'll just say It's good. When I made this, I didn't even had to ask, when he finally came up for air he said This is fricken' delicious! . So, a winner in our house! My husband isn't a fan of beans so I subbed corn for the black beans and only used about 2/3 of the can of refried beans. 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#I added some chopped cilantro to the meat mixture for added taste & I also used one can of chopped green chillis instead of green peppers. Cover top layer with tinfoil because the top of mine browned & got crunchy but it was still good. Thanks for recipe.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Nice comfort food. I used diced tomatoes with green chilies b/c I couldn't find the Mexican ones. The sauce was really spicy in the pan but cooled off in the mix of the casserole. Served with sour cream and lettuce. Will add jalapenos next time. 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This recipe is awesome. I make it frequently. I have just started Weight Watchers. Does anyone know how many points a serving of this would be? Need Protein, carbs, fat & fiber to calculate. Thanks, Glenyah
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Winner, winner! We loved our dinner!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#SO GOOD!! Loved this recipe!! So did my two girls... my 18-month old ate as big of a piece as I did and asked for more! I will definitely be making this again! UPDATE 5/2/2014: I make this dish on a regular basis, still a family favorite. However, this recipe fills a 9x13 casserole dish which is a little too much for us to eat in a couple of days. What I've started doing is mixing all of the filling together - ground beef, onion, pepper, water, taco seasoning, black beans and diced tomatoes - I also started mixing in the refried beans so it's simpler to put together and the taste is the same :-) Then I divide the entire recipe in half. I use 3 tortillas, half the filling and half the cheese and make up a 8x8 dish. Then I take the remaining half of just the filling and freeze it in a freezer container. Next time I want to make this dish, I defrost the filling and then make another 8x8 casserole. Works perfect for my family! 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Great! Substituted corn for black beans and still delicious. Recommend draining meat mixture before layering into lasagna to make the final product less runny - that worked really well for us.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Very yummy, filling and re-heats well!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Excellent. the first time I ate this my awesome aunt made it! Loved it since!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#My husband makes this easy dish at the firehouse all the time! It's a hit and all the guys love it! 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This is fabulous!! Trying new recipes is fun, but you never know if the family is going to like them - they loved this! Even our guest for dinner asked for the recipe! Will be making this again. It is so easy and simple to put together.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This was awesome! The entire family loved it.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#I made this for a birthday party I was hosting and it was a big hit. Fed lots of people to rave reviews!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This was really good & simple to make! Will definately make again.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Yum! So quick and easy to make. Can't wait to have it again. 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Wow, when I find something that my whole family loves, we know that recipe is a keeper. The only thing different was that I garnished with sour cream, fresh tomatoes and some shredded cheese. That was just a preference thing. Excellent!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This recipe was so quick and easy and best of all it was delicious. It tasted even better the next day just like real lasagna. Love it:)
Taco Lasagna#0#0#One of THEE BEST meals to make! Gets better as it marinates overnight!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Delicious recipe. I plan to keep this recipe on hand to make again. My family loved it.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This was very good and easy. Made it according to recipe and no changes. Will make this for the potluck tonight.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This has become one of our family favorites. I use corn tortillas in place of the flour and pinto beans instead of black since my kids aren't big fans of the black. It's wonderful! 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#this was very good have a lot left over. going to freeze some of it. I used whole wheat tortillas and weight watchers Mexican cheese. This was really yummy.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#very delish, could almost use as a dip
Taco Lasagna#0#0#My family absolutely loved this dish and requested that we have it again.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This is a fabulous recipe! Anyone I know who has tried it just loves it. Great as leftovers too! Using cheddar cheese gives more of a rich flavor, though there's so much going on that you really don't need it, and if you like spicy, you can use hot ro-tel, add jalepenos, or substitute pablano pepper for green bell pepper 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#My husband is a firefighter and makes it for the guys at the station. He gets tortilla chips and sour cream so the guys can get creative. They love it. It is a yummy recipe.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#A very good lasagna. In fact you can see your published and copyrighted version on sites on the web so it must be good~
Taco Lasagna#0#0#great recipe is awesome....so easy to make and my husband and son loved it...sons says he is adding this recipe to his favorites...will def make again
Taco Lasagna#0#0#This is going to go into my actual recipe box to make sure I have it forever more. A must have in the dinner rotation.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Love this recipe. Added some light sour cream and jalapenos for garnish.
Taco Lasagna#0#0#By the way! I substitute low-carb tortillas (diabetes) and it does not lose a thing!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#I have made this twice! First the way it was shown and second I added more stuff and played with the cheeses and flavors of ro-tel that is offered. This flys out of the kitchen so fast it's crazy! 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#The boys in the family LOVE this! One reader sent in a good idea...spread refried beans on tortillas while they are on a flat surface and then place in the pan. So much easier!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#My husband and I enjoy this dish and make it for company. I like to cut some extra tortillas and place around the edges so that each layer is completely separated. We also make it without the refried beans occasionally.It is a winner!
Taco Lasagna#0#0#Mine did not look anything like that picture. It was very good. It just looked like two pizza's. I will be making this again. 
Taco Lasagna#0#0#the best lasagna I've eaten, the family couldn't get enough... 
Frosted Banana Bars#2#0#This is my favorite way to use up overripe bananas. And the cream cheese frosting makes them so yummy. Love this recipe!
Frosted Banana Bars#12#2#I have been making this recipe for almost 20 years. My daughters boyfriend loved them so much that he use to bring all the ingredients over so I would make a pan for him to take home with him. I keep getting asked to make these simple yet extremely yummy banana bars.
Frosted Banana Bars#4#1#So easy to make and everyone loved them!
Frosted Banana Bars#13#3#I love how it came out & i didn't change anything, but the frosting. I only put 2 cups of confectioners sugar & i added 2 Tablespoons of chocolate hazelnut spread. 
Frosted Banana Bars#13#16#I have not made these yet. However, I have a suggestion for all baking followers....I made a journal regarding measurements of all kinds. Start weighing your ingredients, everything.. from fruit to nuts??. You will be very surprised at the differences of volume. Example one cup of flour is 4-1/4 ounces, bisquick, and bread flour is also 4-1/4 ounces per cup. A large banana is approx 4.8 ounces...1/4 cup of brown sugar is 2.0 ounces, same for granulated...Just a few examples. Over the years we have used way too much ingredients that changed the recipe..hence the differences of people's results. Happy Baking everyone????????
Frosted Banana Bars#1#42#Horrible, bars were super dense no flavor . Super disappointed
Frosted Banana Bars#7#0#I made these for my daughters school lunches. They were a huge hit! I did 1 cup white sugar 1 cup brown sugar. I also added half a bag of semisweet chocolate chips into the batter
Frosted Banana Bars#3#0#Really delicious and moist! Hubby doesn't like cake but ate three pieces of this! Only changes I made were to half the icing sugar in the frosting and left out the butter in frosting. Everyone loved them. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I make this recipe several times a year. I find I can cut the sugar to 1.5 cups, and I like to add raisins and walnuts or pecans. They freeze well.
Frosted Banana Bars#6#1#Love, love, love this recipe! Have made it many times. When my bananas get too ripe, I toss them in the freezer, then when I have enough, I make bars! Yum! An extra banana adds extra moist banana -y goodness!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#1#Oh, my, this is good! Nice and moist, with well-balanced banana flavor. My kids said it rivaled carrot cake - which they love. The cream cheese frosting rounds out the flavor. Definitely a keeper recipe - and a great way to use up over-ripe bananas!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Absolutely Delicious!!!!
Frosted Banana Bars#4#1#I have been making this recipe for 20+ years and anyone who has tried it just loves it. It's wonderful and a quick dessert. My daughter's old boyfriend use to bring over the stuff to make it and I would make a batch just for him. 
Frosted Banana Bars#3#6#I made these and they turned out WAY to sugary and not moist at all. Why two cups of sugar when you have the natural sweetness of the bananas. Really disappointed.
Frosted Banana Bars#4#0#Made this recipe to the letter except added walnuts to the batter and frosting. Batter mixes up well and bakes quickly in the sheet cake pan. Frosting is tasty, but does not have as strong of a cream cheese flavor as recipes made without the added butter this one has. The cake is relatively moist and has a nice texture, but without any spices, it tastes a bit bland. I will make this again, but will add some cinnamon and/or nutmeg to give it a bit of a boost in flavor.
Frosted Banana Bars#2#0#Excellent!!! For the frosting I substituted 1tsp banana extract and 1tsp vanilla extract! It made such a huge difference! (I LOVE bananas). I've had tons of compliments. I'll definitely make it again and again and again!,,,
Frosted Banana Bars#2#0#Excellent!! I cut sugar in half and used a little brown sugar as some other reviewers did and only made half the icing recipe. Very tender, moist, perfect texture. Best banana bread I have had.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Made it with a brown butter frosting instead.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I have made this recipe numerous of times
Frosted Banana Bars#1#0#Karen-I got your recipe when it was first published in Taste of Home. I'm currently living in Egypt and I make it a lot. We have a banana vendor almost at my front door. Thank you so much for sharing.
Frosted Banana Bars#3#0#These bars are AMAZING!! I'd eat the whole pan myself ! I use only one cup of sugar and 4 ripe bananas. They are sweet without the exra cup plus adding the frosting makes them even sweeter. Not sure what 2-star Pamala did back in Feb 2020 but ive been making these for YEARS!! Tried and true this recipe is definitely more then 5 stars!! Its quick to maje as well. Kids and adults will love it!! 
Frosted Banana Bars#1#0#I have made this so many times! It is a favorite of ours. Freezes in cut pieces very well. I usually add about 1/2 c ground walnuts just because we love them!
Frosted Banana Bars#2#1#WOW - these were the best banana bars I've ever made. To begin, I used Country Crock Olive Oil Plant Butter. I only had 1 cup of white sugar, so to substitute I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar (not packed), and a scant cup of chocolate chips. While still warm I drizzled with my own cardamom glaze, made of butter, milk, powdered sugar, vanilla and ground cardamom (I am not a fan of cream cheese frosting). This was not my first time making these, but the above changes elevated this recipe to a whole new level. 
Frosted Banana Bars#3#1#Made this today and both my husband and I thought it is delicious. I cut back on the sugar (used about 1 1/2 cups) we don't like cake too sweet. I also make a glaze for top (1 cup Powdered Sugar, 2 tablespoons milk, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla plus couple dashes of nutmeg). I baked it in a glass 15X10 baking dish at 325 for about 30 min. Glaze was sufficient for that size. 
Frosted Banana Bars#1#0#This was AWESOME! I didn't have the big pan so I did as someone noted and made in 13x9. It was very moist and had good banana flavor. I would definitely make this again. Thanks for a great recipe. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#These are so good and I haven't even frosted them yet. Think I might just dust with a little powdered sugar this time so we can eat them right away. Like NOW!! 
Frosted Banana Bars#1#0#These are amazing! Loaded with flavor. I did add an extra banana to the batter and a tablespoon of corn syrup and honey to the frosting
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I made these today , it's wonderful ! Didn't change a thing, I added cinnamon because I thought the recipe called for it ! I love banana cake, bars, bread, this is terrific!!'
Frosted Banana Bars#1#0#Pamela rated it 2 stars because the bars didn't turn out. She clearly added things to the recipe and threw it off balance. This is such an easy and tasty recipe! My family loves them!!
Frosted Banana Bars#1#0#I have been making these bars for many, many years. We call it Banana Cake , but it is one of the most requested recipes that I make. They are delicious and moist, plenty of flavor. I have a photo of the recipe in my phone so I can send it to people after I have prepared it for a large group. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#6#More like a flat sheet cake. Should have made cupcakes with frosting instead.... NOT bar like at all. I did know better to add some spices, otherwise it would have been a bland even though I added 4 large bananas. I also used 1/4 cup brown sugar in hopes it would add more depth... no chance... back to the family cookbook for me.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#5#this pie looks marvellously delicious.
Frosted Banana Bars#1#0#Made in a 13× 9 pan. Baked for 45 min. Added chopped pecans to the mix and over the frosted bars. Delicious as always.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#This is a great recipeabout the only recipe I use for overripe bananas. I add walnuts or pecans and raisins. It freezes especially well. I cut it into bars first.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#A friend made this for us, really good. Have a nice taste, texture and moist. These are great for family and friends also for a social pot luck.. There won't be any left for the next day. 
Frosted Banana Bars#1#0#This is my second review and it is still thee best banana bar recipe. You can use a 13 x 9 greased pan. Increase baking time to 35 minutes or until done. You only need half of the frosting recipe and it is the perfect amount for the 13 x9 . 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Wonderful - I'd give it 10 stars if I could! Having a hard time keeping my hands from snatching a piece every time I walk past the fridge. 
Frosted Banana Bars#1#0#Outstanding. I took this to a party, having never made it before, and it got rave reviews. I also baked it in a 13 x 9 pyrex pan and increased the cooking time somewhat, based on other reviewer suggestions. it came out great. I didn't have enough confectioner's sugar, so I reduced the butter and cream cheese somewhat, and added a little milk to help it spread better. It still came out delicious! 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I absolutely love this recipe but I think it tastes even better if you replace the flour with Banana multi purpose flour by pereg. This banana flour is an amazing replacement for all sorts of recipes.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#These bars are better than banana bread. Very moist. I add chopped walnuts and the bars go fast whenever I make them.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#These bars taste great. I like to add 1/2-3/4 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans to the bar recipe in order to add extra flavor and some crunch. I also prefer a thicker bar, so I bake this recipe in a 13x9x2-inch pan. The icing is very good and a perfect addition to these bars.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#1#This was very easy and made a good quantity of delicious bars. I had about 5 smaller sized bananas to use up, and this recipe was perfect. I threw in a little cinnamon & candied ginger for added flavor. Like others, I used a 15x9 pan (glass), increased time by 15 minutes, and halved the frosting. I also used a pineapple cream cheese in the frosting because I happened to have this available & needed to use it up along with the bananas! It proved to be an excellent choice for the frosting.The bars were moist and flavorful. Definitely a keeper!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I have made these three times and they are perfect. I substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour and added 1/2 cup of flaxseed meal. I also cut the sugar in half and added 1/8 cup of honey. Finally, I used reduced fat cream cheese. My coworkers won't know the difference! 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Made these over the weekend and the bars were moist, delicious and perfect to have with your morning coffee. My husband took several pieces to work and shared a piece with his co-worker and now the guy wants the recipe so his wife can make him a plateful..this recipe is definitely a keeper...
Frosted Banana Bars#2#0#My whole family loves this recipe, including my son who may just be the pickiest eater I have ever know. My only change was I had to use a 13x9 and add 15 minutes. I guess with it being smaller, the icing gets to be a little thick for my husband who doesn't have much of a sweet tooth but I love it. Thinking about adding some spices and nuts once just for fun, but definitely not necessary for this recipe. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Had a lot of over ripe bananas and needed a change from banana bread. This is excellent, even without the frosting.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#easy and good...will make again
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Oh Wow! So easy and so tasty! I made my first batch for my husbands work the next day....well it didn't make it! Gotta make another batch! This is a recipe I am sharing with my daughters! 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Every time I make these delicious banana bars, they get gobbled up so fast! A great way to use use up ripe bananas and have a great desert. I always half the amount of frosting because it makes so much.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#This was delicious. Shared it with my neighbors who also loved it. Will definitely make it again.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I made this for the first time - this recipe is a keeper! I added 2 more bananas to the recipe, just cooked a little longer - my family loves it
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I have made this recipe a million times and they are always a big hit!! I have also added walnuts to the batter for a nice addition.
Frosted Banana Bars#1#0#My family really enjoyed this. I made it in a 9x13 pan because I didn't have the right size. So it came out cakey but was fine. Stored in the fridge. Tasted better cold to me. And made it a bit more dense. Not as light and cakey 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I did have to bake mine about 15 minutes longer than mentioned but sure worth waiting for. Delicious, easy and a keeper. Thank you for Sharing.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#taste real good but the frosting just a little runny
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#These are really easy and so delicious. I only had a half sheet pan. They were thinner than usual but still turned out great. Highly recommended!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#These bars are so good! I had bananas to use up and my family loved these!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#My teenage boys gave this amazing dessert five stars! Even though I made it into a cake since I did not have a 15x10 pan. Took an extra 15 min baking time but well worth the wait. The frosting mirrors our local bakery's delicious frosting and now I cam make this at home. The boys said they will avoid eating the bananas so I can make this again. Thank you for sharing. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Outstanding! This is so easy and is a hit at every gathering. My college age son begs me to bring to share with his housemates every time I visit.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Just made these today. Had to use two 8x8 square baking pans, baked for 24 minutes. Turned out beautifully. Think I will cut the frosting recipe in half, to save on calories and sweetness next time. Gets two thumbs up on deliciousness!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I have been looking for this recipe. These classic old fashioned bars are so good & always a crowd pleaser.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#1#In my view, bars are denser than cake. I should have realized that with three eggs, this recipe was going to be more cakey than bar-like. It tastes good, but it's not what I expected or wanted. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I made these this weekend 4/2016, and they are delicious. I didn't change anything about the recipe and didn't need to. They would be good with walnuts in them or sprinkled on top of the icing. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I've been making this recipe for years and EVERYONE loves it. I have shared the recipe tons of times. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I made these following the directions exactly. They were very good.
Frosted Banana Bars#1#0#My son LOVED these banana bars and has been asking me to make them again! My husband thought there was too much frosting and scraped most of it off. Next time, I will make less frosting or double the recipe and make 2 pans!!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#My husband says this is absolutely the best thing I make!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Great! Another hit at the Senior Center...Just like the Chocolate Banana Muffins made as mini's. I cut the sugar in half using 3/4 cup of brown and 1/4 cup of Splenda. Also, cut the frosting in half and still had left over frosting. Makes way to much unless you want as much frosting as cake. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Great way to use up those left over bananas...the cream cheese frosting is what takes these to the next level.
Frosted Banana Bars#1#0#These were amazing. It was such a great way to use my brown bananas instead of making banana bread. I will say it didn't feel like a bar to me, but more like a shallow banana cake. It was a little dry to me, but I may have over baked it. The frosting was delicious & the two combined were such a great treat. I will make these again (for sure!) & try to make them a little better on my end, such as not over baking. Great recipe. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I was very surprised they were so good and they were easy
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#The best banana bars ever! Anytime I make these they are always the first thing to disappear! Even people who say they don't like bananas and bakery made with bananas love them. They are so quick and easy to make and it makes a large pan for sharing = ) 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I cut the sugar for frosting in half. Delight!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#My husband declared these banana bars'very good'. They are also good with vanilla or lemon frosting. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#These bars are really good! I have made them two times now within a week. The first time, I made as written...excellent, but the frosting was a bit too rich. Second time I left unfrosted and they are just as good. We have been adding a frosting of cream cheese, a little confectioners' sugar with whipped topping folded in to a few ..just enough sweet on top! 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#PRETTY GOOD .....I FOUND IF YOU MAKE THE BANANA MIX AND COVER IT AND LET IT SIT OVERNIGHT THE TASTE OF THE BANANAS JUST REALLY POPS! FROST THE NEXT DAY.....ALSO IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO MIX FROSTING IF YOU LET THE BUTTER AND CREAM CHEESE SAT TO ROOM TEMPERTURE, AFTER FROSTING I STICK IT BACK IN THE FRIDGE TO SET UP JUST A BIT.....TOOK IT TO A CHURCH FUNCTION AND NOW HAVE TO MAKE A COPY FOR SOMEONE :).....ALMOST FORGOT, IT TURNED OUT BETTER WHEN I MADE IT IN A 9X13 AND BAKED IT FOR ABOUT 35 MIN. COMPARED TO THE 15X10 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I made this yesterday. Just delicious. I used a brown sugar icing instead of cream cheese as I don't care for cream cheese icing. It was so good! 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#This is a great recipe. Added walnuts to top of frosting and left them off half of the cake and split with a couple of friends; although I could have eaten the whole thing! Will definitely make again.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I have made this recipe many times just as written. Everytime my grandson needs a desert for scouts, he ( and often the scouts) asks me to make these. The frosting makes a lot but the boys seem to think the more the better. When I make it for home, I will cut it into squares and freeze them on a sheet pan. When frozen I can then put them in a container on top of each other and the frosting doesn't stick to the waxed paper. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I am baking these banana bars now. I used a 15 x 10 x 1 inch pan as directed. (jelly roll size). The batter is overflowing into the bottom of my oven. Did anyone else have that problem?
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#This is a great recipe! Easy, and gone in a snap. I add walnuts to the cake and on top of the icing. A must is very ripe bananas, one even over ripe for best flavor.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I've made these 100's of times because they are so good. The only thing different I do is, I sprinkle chopped walnuts over the frosting. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Wow, these are amazing! After reading the reviews I followed the suggestions of cutting back on the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and adding 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. I did not make as much frosting as the recipe called for and also cut back on the amount of cream cheese (not a big fan). This recipe is definitely a keeper!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I made this cake for a family dinner of twenty five. Perfect with no nuts, which some of the grandkids oppose, and it was for a sheet pan. It was so good! Everyone loved it. Perfect. I will definitely use this recipe often.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#This is a great recipe, my kids love it and it's a fun treat instead of banana bread. I've made it many times and the only change I've ever made has been to add toasted, chopped nuts! 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#delicious
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I made these for a group of cheer coaches and judges at my daughter's school. What a hit! They were moist and delicious and many came back for seconds and thirds. The recipe was simple and a good choice. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I used to make this recipe all the time and I had forgotten how delicious it was. Note: If you freeze your overripe bananas, be sure to drain them well before adding to batter.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#amazing
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Awesome recipe!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#No wonder why this is a 5 star recipe! I'm so happy I tried it!! Perfect for a crowd, or to share with your co-workers. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Best way to use up overripe bananas. Very easy and quick to make and delicious.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#These are so so delicious! The second time I made them I ran out of icing sugar and I only had about three cups and it was just as good if not better! Definitely recommend this one!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#A beloved recipe! I lost my copy and was so happy to find this one. Mine come out every time! Quick and the frosting is so good!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#First time making these and they where a hit!! Just followed the directions and they came out perfect. Will def be making these often!!!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#This is my go to recipe for a delicious dessert! I follow the recipe and it always turns out perfect even the cream cheese frosting!! Recently made these and there wasn't even 1 left. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Followed the directions but the bars came out dry on the edges and raw in the middle. The frosting came out REALLY runny. I even added more powdered sugar and it didn't help. After reading the other reviews I might try it again but cut the whole recipe in 1/2 so if it doesn't work out I won't be throwing away as much food and money I did this time. I'll probably lower the temp to 325° and let it bake a few more minutes. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#1#I had a pan that was too short, so the batter was deeper, and I had to lengthen the baking time. I was short cream cheese for the frosting, and forgot the vanila, and it STILL CAME OUT GREAT! Very cake-like and moist, awesome banana flavor, a go-to recipe to take to a gathering!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#This were so moist and yummy. I think next time I make these, I will throw in a handful of minichocolate chips. I cut the icing recipe in half.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#So good!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Have made this again and again over the years. I don't change anything except I don't make the full frosting recipe. It is a bit too much. Great, easy recipe. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Banana banana banana!!!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#My son loved this treat! Glad I cut back the icing sugar to 2c rather than 4c. Its a keeper for my recipe box.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#very yummy. the frosting is good too but almost too much. i added four large bananas to use them up and it turned out great. very easy recipe.
Frosted Banana Bars#1#0#I'm going to repeat my review of a while ago. Don't waste your time measuring the mashed bananas; I've found three bananas works every time--and I dump the rest of the ingredients with the mashed bananas and give the beaters a few spins to mix it all together. Because the cake is sweet enough as is, I never add the frosting, and it's never missed. This is a no-fail, moist every time, always praised recipe. A professional wedding cake baker asked me for this recipe because she was going to replace hers for this one. You will not be disappointed. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#This was easy to pull together on short notice and super-tasty. A great way to use leftover bananas!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#These turned out great and tasted terrific...such an easy way to use leftover bananas!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I love these bars, I could eat the whole pan myself. They are a nice change from pumpkin bars, but they stay nice and moist and disappear quickly!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#LOVE these! So awesome!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Made a batch and brought to a school function for others to review and enjoy. Well liked, by both kids and adults. A few commented it may be nice to have the addition of toasted nuts or coconut topping. Also, most said it tasted more like cake than a bar. Everyone enjoyed the frosting though...even those who normally said they were not banana bread eaters. Will make again.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I think I overcooked mine a little so I'll watch it closer next time. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#love it love it love it!!!! and so did everyone else. what else can I say..
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#LOVE LOVE LOVE! I cut the sugar back to 1 cup and the confectioners sugar to 3 cups - turned out delicious. Next time I'd cut the sugar in the frosting in half - that would be sweet enough. This one's a keeper. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Yummy!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Just made this recipe and it's simply D E L I S H! Super rich, moist and sweet! Dh/son L O V E I T! 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#These are AWESOME!!! I don't like bananas but they were mashed so that was great. I also added a 1/2 C. Crushed Walnuts to the batter which was wonderful. I will make these again!!! 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Can't count the times I've made this. I like to make it for hubs to share with co-workers and have also lost count of the times I shared the recipe. Simple cake, on-hand ingredients, very easy and super delicious. Can't ask for more. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#this always go fast in my house! easy to put together with ingredients typically one hand... win win recipe!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#This recipe is a family favorite.. Great way to use banana instead of making banana bread. Sometimes I just sprinkle it with powdered sugar... It's STILL yummy! 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#My husband's all time favorite!! He requests them often! 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I have made this recipe for years. It is Delicious.Re: one of the reviews This recipe is correct as written. There is another recipe for Frosted Banana Bars on the TOH site.that has 1 1/2 cups sugar and sour cream.https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/Frosted-Banana-Bars-2
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Tasted great! I used a 9x13 pan due to the small size of my oven so the sweet icing was a little overpowering, but still good.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#this is so easy to make..and taste great..i like it with out the frosting on it to..
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#This makes a bigger batch than I thought. Not too sweet and great banana flavor.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I have been using this recipe since it came out in the magazine many, many years ago. I've taken it to church for the after church social hour , and it quickly disappears. My husband loves it. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Best Banana Bars Period. I dare you to eat just one!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#i make this alot...taste great..every one loves it..so easy to make
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I made these banana bars a few months ago, and they were fantastic. I actually made banana bars a long time ago, but I lost the recipe, and so I was happy to find this one, because they tasted like the ones I used to make. I'm glad my brother was in town to help eat them up! 
Frosted Banana Bars#1#0#I almost made this recipe -- but when I saw 2 cups of sugar stopped, because that didn't seem right. Sure enough, I went digging for my old paper copy from the magazine - and it was totally different! 1-1/2 cups sugar, plus 1 cup sour cream! I'm sticking with the tried & true. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#These are amazing!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Waaaay too tasty! It was hard for us to eat just one bar. This recipe is a keeper! I was going to try several banana bar recipes but this one turned out so well, there is no reason to try any more. Thanks for sharing!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I have been making this recipe forever. It is my favorite for ripe banana's. Not as dry as banana bread, my family loves it. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I needed to use up some bananas that were in my freezer plus go to a potluck so thought this would be a great recipe to make. HOWEVER I made mini cupcakes instead of the bars. They turned out great! It yielded 60 minis and I baked them at 350 for 12 min. I only made half the frosting and added that to some store bought cream cheese frosting that I already had in the frig. and also only used 1 cup powdered sugar. Then I topped the cupcakes with toasted, chopped walnuts. Needless to say there were no leftovers for me to bring home! Oh well, guess I'll just have to make more!! 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Very good. I chunked some of the bananas instead of smashing them all. I added a bit of almond extract to the frosting and sprinkled the frosting with honey roasted almonds.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#This is by far the best banana recipe I have ever made. I make this for breakfast and dessert treats. Everyone loves it!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#There is something to be said for comfort food type desserts and THIS is one of them. Absolutely delicious and easy to prepare. I made them for a baby shower and the gals loved them. I really like that they are thinner and can be eaten with fingers instead of a fork. The cream cheese frosting is perfect...not too sweet. When my bananas get too ripe to eat, I put them in the freezer and then pull them out to make these bars.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I make this frequently, both for dessert and for breakfast treats. It always goes fast!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#These are the best banana bars. I get asked to bake them often. You can change up the recipe if you like, but it is not necessary at all.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#EXCELLENT! Super easy, one of my most requested desserts. Don't measure bananas...just use 3 spotty ones; it works every time. I, too, use a 9 x 13 pan. You won't be disappointed with this one. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#My daughter and I just made these. Delicious! I don't have a 10 X 15 pan so I used a 9 X 13 and baked a little longer. I halved the frosting recipe and I used low fat cream cheese with wonderful results. I also added about 1/3 cup finely chopped walnuts. We are throwing out our old banana bread recipe and replacing it with this! 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Fabulous! My dad loved these bars. He said they tasted just like my grandmother's. NOw my children love them, too! 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#very good I used four medium sized banannas. Gave it a wonderful taste
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I make these in a 9 x 13 pan and people can't get enough of them. They take a little longer to bake, but I just adjusted to that. I've made these in the 10 x 15 pan and they didn't go over as well. Today I just finished making them int he smaller pan and added chocolate chips to them....They were extra special. If you're worried about the calories, don't bake them. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#My Mom has made these bars in the 50es but did not use the cream cheese we frosted them with a home cooked marshmellow topping then a thin frosting.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Excellent! Love the cream cheese frosting!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#This has become a favorite family go to. Very delicious!!NancyIndiana 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#This is a great go to recipe for over ripe bananas. Been making it since 94.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Delicious! Extremely easy to make and the cream cheese frosting is divine. 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#This was wonderful! Very easy to make and the frosting was great! Everyone loved them, thank you.CA
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#Great! Quick to make and easy. We loved them and will make them without hesitation next time I have to bring a dessert to pass!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0# 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I made these bars, instead of my usual banana bread, and they were a huge hit. I brought them into work and had to give out the recipe. To save time, use store-bought cream cheese frosting.
Frosted Banana Bars#1#0#I made these for the first time for a funeral this past weekend. I've had this recipe in my recipe box for years, but have never made it.They were amazing! I had more people than I can remember ask me for the recipe! These were gone before everything else!Thank you for a great recipe! I will try all the other recipes from your magazine that I have had for years now too! 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I made these bars also, and they are sooo delicious!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I left the frosting off to shave off calories, and they still tasted pretty good - moist and fluffy.
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#I've made these moist, sweet bars a couple of times and my coworkers and husband are always excited to taste them. Excellent! 
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#This recipe holds up well even with nuts added.Chopped walnuts added a little extra texture and worked out fabulously!
Frosted Banana Bars#0#0#These bars are so moist and flavorful. I'll be fixing these again!! 
Shrimp Scampi#6#0#I've made this recipe several times. Added a little more garlic because we love it. It is always cleaned up. Not a leftover to be found. Thank you for sharing. 
Shrimp Scampi#5#7#I followed recipe and this wasn't a hit with my partner. The sauce just wasn't there, or so thin it just fell through the noodles to the bottom of plate. The flavor was also just so so for me. Thinking maybe adding some cream and maybe a touch of dill, right before the the breadcrumbs and Cheese might have helped the flavor and thicken the sauce a bit. 
Shrimp Scampi#1#0#My husband loves this. Me too.
Shrimp Scampi#5#1#My family loved this. Easy to make. Will make again.
Shrimp Scampi#10#6#This should get 20 stars! Absolutely delicious & easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly with only one change. Since didn't have a big enough oven proof skillet, transferred it to a baking pan to finish the step for the oven. Thank Thank you for this awesome recipe. This is a classy restaurant quality dish & keeper in my rotation. This will also make a great appetizer served with a side of crusty bread. 
Shrimp Scampi#10#1#After reading the reviews I decided to double the sauce. It was very good. Wouldn't change a thing. I did put over fettucine just because my family is not fond of the consistency of angel hair pasta. Will make again. 
Shrimp Scampi#4#0#Really easy to make and tastes great! I added some of the zest from the lemon for even more flavor.
Shrimp Scampi#4#1#Wife and I loved this
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Easy to fix. Taste great! Will fix again!
Shrimp Scampi#4#0#Very good shrimp! Next time I will probably season the pasta as well with some butter and Parmesan before plating, as there wasn't quite enough sauce to really flavor the pasta for us.
Shrimp Scampi#7#12#I had great hopes for this recipe after reading the reviews, but we were very disappointed. I made it for dinner last night and the only adjustments I made were to add white wine to produce more sauce but it was still far too dry and to top the pasta with the shrimp mixture before broiling We also thought it was very bland; with the amount of garlic and lemon juice we thought it would taste better. I've been thinking about how to improve it: add lemon zest? saute the shrimp in the butter/oil instead of simmering in the liquid? I've decided to use other shrimp scampi recipes instead. The crispy broiled topping was wonderful so will try that with another recipe. 
Shrimp Scampi#4#0#I really liked this recipe. Husband and I have made this twice and both times cleaned our plates. The lemon flavor is subtle and the shrimp cooked perfectly! A keeper for sure!
Shrimp Scampi#2#0#Very delicious and super easy to convert to Keto friendly! I just didn't add bread crumbs and it was still delicious! I also substituted regular noodles with healthy 0 net carb noodles..and added a little cooking wine. Classic dish, thank you!! 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I really like this recipe. Before dinner, my husband said he wasn't very hungry, but then he proceeded to clean his plate. Such good flavor! I will definitely keep this quick and delicious recipe in my toolbox. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Great recipe! I modified slightly... based on other reviews, I added a cup of white wine as the sauce does need a bit more. Also added in thinly sliced red onions. Lastly, did not bother to broil...was fantastic!
Shrimp Scampi#5#1#I made this to try to make us feel better about having a lonely COVID ( no children or grandchildren) Christmas dinner. It was delicious and so easy. Hubby hates lemon so I just made the garlic butter sauce and used thin spaghetti since we didn't have angel hair pasta. I will be making this many times!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This is a fantastic recipe. The flavors were so wonderful. The only change we made was adding mushrooms but I can promise I will make this recipe for many years to come!! My husband gave my cooking a 5 star restaurant rating for this recipe!! Enjoy! We also used angle hair pasta.
Shrimp Scampi#1#0#I made this on a whim after looking for a recipe to used leftover grilled shrimp. It was *amazing*. Hours later, I am still thinking about it. Reading some of the other comments, I thought the amount of lemon was perfect. Tangy, zingy, mouth watering. I'll be making it again. Thank you!! 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Very good dish. Followed recipe except mixed pasta in before sprinkling with cheese, bread crumbs and parsley.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Really good! The lemon was a little overwhelming or it would have gotten 5. Next time I''ll use a lighter hand with it. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I made this for a family gathering. I was pleasantly surprised how easy and delicious it was!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Went camping, needed a good scampi recipe for 2lbs. I looked over many. This is the one. Only added 1/4+ white wine WITH lemon juice, and cooked it in a frying pan instead of the broiler. Was absolutely fantastic! Plenty of great flavors. Very easy to make. The zinger here really is the bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Adds additional flavor and soaks up all the good stuff. I will be putting this one in my dinner rotation.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Perfection. Quick, easy, and flavorful. A win in this house!
Shrimp Scampi#1#0#Quick easy meal, can be served over rice or pasta. Add a salad and dinner is ready. My teen daughter prepared when I came home from hospital.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This recipe was easy and full of flavor. The only thing I did different, was add a little white wine. Delicious!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Added a couple crab cakes to the breadcrumb and cheese topping. Lemon was perfect with that addition and will definitely make again.
Shrimp Scampi#1#3#This has WAY too much lemon. I haven't tried it with reduced or zero lemon juice but I think it would probably be pretty bland. It needs more garlic and something to give it a little zing. Granted, though, it was a very easy experiment. 
Shrimp Scampi#2#0#Absolutely delicious! Doubled ingredients for 2 lbs on shrimp!
Shrimp Scampi#2#1#A big hit - delicious!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Delicious!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Uh oh.....I added 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs instead of the 1/4 cup called for in recipe. The sauce turned out super think, not really sauce exactly. It tasted good. Is there anyway to salvage the sauce?
Shrimp Scampi#4#0#What kind of white wine is best for this recipe?
Shrimp Scampi#0#1#Easy and quick using precooked frozen shrimp! I used Italian seasoning instead of oregano. Placing under the broiler gave it a nice texture. I also used 1 lb. of asparagus, steamed and cut into pieces. Yummy!!
Shrimp Scampi#1#1#This recipe was spot on. Made for my wife's birthday dinner and she absolutely loved it. Added shallot, diced tomatoes And red pepper flakes...Will definitely be making again..
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#The flavors of this dish were excellent! Next time we're going to add tomatoes and artichoke hearts to add a little color and veg. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#1#Delicious. I poured the shrimp and sauce over zoodles then added the cheese and Panko instead of bread crumbs, then put it all under the broiler. Will definitely make again.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Best recipe for shrimp! Excellent
Shrimp Scampi#0#1#This has become a go to recipe each Wednesday night for our family. To make it extra tasty, we double the sauce and add white wine, and do a pound and a half of shrimp to get more protein. Delicious!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#So delicious. Made exactly as recipe states. It was amazing. The whole family loved it!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Me and my family just love this recipe and my son-in-law who worked in many fine restaurants said it is one of the best shrimp scampi recipes he has ever had. Delicious
Shrimp Scampi#1#0#Made accordingly to recipe. Loved it. Will make again!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I followed the recipe as written. I am not a big garlic fan, so only used two cloves.I sometimes use more shrimp. This recipe is definitely one of my favorites!
Shrimp Scampi#0#1#omg!! so delicious. it tasted better than any restaurant dish i have had. did everything as directed. only change added salt and crushed red pepper flakes and some white wine. we added the cooked pasta at the end and mixed everything together and it was beyond anything i have ever made. wow!!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Delicious. As someone else said Classic shrimp scampi . I did deviate from the recipe at all except to add 1 extra clove of garlic. But my husband and I are garlic lives and 5 cloves would be a little much for most people. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This was good...I added chopped spinach and cherry tomatoes as I needed to use them up. Next time will broil the shrimp mix on top of the noodles. It made a very pretty, crusty presentation that had to be broken up when putting on the pasta. Also next time I will peel and de-tail the shrimp first!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I've been searching for a really good shrimp scampi and this is it. I followed the receipe but add diced onion. I would add more shrimp but left over noodles were good too. Try it you'll love it.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#printed
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Very good exactly as written. Flavor was really good, and the recipe is very easy and fast. I will definitely make again
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Very good and definitely will make it again. A little too tart for me so I'll not quite use all of the 1/4 c lemon juice.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This is buddy valastro's recipe with the exception of putting under broiler. In my 62 years of cooking, (since 8 years old) I have spent the last 2 years modifying my method to buddys. This recipe takes it up a notch because of the broiling...better for the bread crumbs. I significantly increase the number of shrimps (usually 2 plus pounds) and increase the sauce. It is classic shrimp scampi. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This recipe really good I definitely make it again
Shrimp Scampi#1#0#Love this recipe! Will never go back to my old way. Lots of flavor
Shrimp Scampi#0#2#Incredibly tasty! Hubby and I made this today for the first time and loved it. Used crunchy Italian bread crumbs. Doubled the butter and increased amount of cheese. Also added some frank's hot sauce. Absolutely delicious. Thanks for this wonderful recipe! 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Made this once before and found it to be very good. I am making it today for Easter dinner as there is only the two of us and wanted something elegant, but delicious. My only changes (based on the first time) is I will add a bit more garlic (it all depends on the size of your garlic cloves, some are small, but some I buy are huge) and I will add some white wine to the sauce (also will double the sauce). This time I plan on serving it over rice instead of the pasta. That along with some steamed asparagus and rolls...............Yummmmmm.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#i have made this 2x now and it is the easiest and most delicious shrimp scampi recipe i have had. my boyfriend loves it. a quick 30 minute meal
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I have made this numerous times and it always gets a lot of complements. Restaurant quality! My go to for a quick meal. I would make extra sauce because the pasta absorbs it. Delish!!l
Shrimp Scampi#1#0#This was ok, it needs double the sauce and half the parsley. My hubby did not like it at all.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#So good!!!!! I took the shrimp out of the sauce breaded it then broiled it added the sauce to the cooked pasta and after arranging the shrimp topped it off with more cheese. Family abusoluty loved it.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I make this at least 1/month. My fiance has always been fond of Red Lobster's shrimp scampi. Last time we ate there, he thought scampi was bland. I use slightly less lemon juice & more cloves of garlic. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This is by far the best shrimp scampi recipe I've ever made! My family loved it & we'll be making it again!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This recipe needs about a half cup of chicken broth or white wine to keep it from being too dry. Otherwise, it is very, very tasty.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This may be better with a few changes. Little bland and too much lemon
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This recipe was a hit! We loved it.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This dish with all it's flavors is easy to make and absolutely delicious!! I think fresh parsley is a nice touch along with fresh lemons! The only other thing I've added is white cooking wine and have gotten amazing feedback every time I make it and will definitely be serving this again! 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Simple to make and everyone liked it.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I have tried several shrimp scampi recipes over the years and this one is definitely the best! We added some spinach after to the pasta after draining the water. My husband and I agree that this was restaurant quality. Thanks for sharing!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Quick, easy and SO tasty!! I added a few fresh tomatoes (chopped) to the skillet with the garlic and it was yummy!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#We thought this was delicious! This was my first time using a cast-iron skillet, but it was just so easy. The only thing I changed was that I used spaghetti instead of angel hair. Oh and I also used dried parsley instead of fresh. I can understand why the one reviewer said it was dry , but I don't really agree. There isn't a traditional sauce. But the lemon and butter definitely keep this from becoming dry. Even the leftovers were delicious. We will definitely make this again. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Agreed with Robby1 the sauce was good enough to double!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Why go to a restaurant when you can make this delicious Shrimp Scampi at home!! Next time I will double the sauce. So good and easy to put together!!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Excellent recipe. I made French bread to go with it, and it was great for sopping up the juices.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Absolutely scrumptious without changing a thing. Highly recommend. Have to have again, soon!
Shrimp Scampi#0#1#(Stars still aren't working right. All are'black')I'd give it a one star although hubby said he liked it. Won't make it again. Was dry. Prefer my shrimp stir-fried or coconut covered. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This was amazing! I've never had better, even in a restaurant. My son and I sat there moaning while eating it. Lol I highly recommend with no changes. Fab! 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Excellent and is quick and easy to make.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#My husband loved it. However it is rich.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Easy to make and delicious
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I love the broiling with breadcrumbs for crunch but it did overcook the shrimp a bit. Overall this was awesome.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This was a quicker version of shrimp scampi than my usual, but was very tasty. I add 1/4 C white wine to the sauce for additional flavor that we enjoy. The crumb topping added a pleasant crunch. As another reviewed has said, take care NOT to overcook the shrimp. I have also doubled the recipe for company and added 1lb bay scallops for a seafood scampi that is quite good. We enjoy the texture of angel hair pasta with our scampi. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Delicious! Easy to prepare, flavorful, and loved by everyone. Just as a side note, if you are serving this with pasta, there is not a lot of liquid, so you may want to add some for your pasta. I used a splash of olive oil, but some white wine or broth might taste good, too.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#So quick, simple & good. Restaurant quality taste. I used farfalle (bow tie) pasta & it was perfect, all the nooks & crannies collected the crumbs & garlic. Once the garlic is minced & the shrimp is cleaned, this dish comes together in 5 minutes. I made this recipe as is, but you could add a veggie or two, it would be fabulous.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I'm always looking for the perfect shrimp scampi recipe. This might be it. 
Shrimp Scampi#1#0#Delicious! Be careful not to overcook the shrimp though. With sauteing and a quick broil, it's easy to do. I will make again and will add a little white wine. We did enjoy the added crunch from Panko breadcrumbs! 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Wow!! I am amazed that such a simple dish tastes so great :)
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Replaced the lemon juice with white wine. I followed all of the other ingredients though. Came out great.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This is a GREAT shrimp scampi recipe. It was super simple and delish! I did add more garlic and lemon juice. So good!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Best shrimp scampi recipe I've found. I added an extra clove of garlic because we love garlic. To create more sauce, I added some homemade creamy tomato soup that I had on hand. Skipped the parsley. It was heavenly. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Best we' ve ever had!!! Absolutely delicious!!!!! 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I tried many shrimp scampi recipes. This one is the tastiest of all! I double the recipe just because I have all males in the house. Followed it to a T and it was great! Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe ?? 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Excellent! Because of personal preference, we'll cut back on the amount of garlic next time. The only other chance we made was to add a splash of white wine. Thanks so much for the recipe - we'll use it often. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#If I could give this recipe 25 stars, I would. This is by far the most amazing shrimp scampi recipe I have EVER made. And I've made many over the years. I really feel this is THE ONE I've been looking for.Having just read the review from happy18777 I could have just put my review as ditto!!!!!!!!!!P.S. I will now stop looking for the perfect shrimp scampi recipe 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Being a New Englander I have had some of the best restaurant Shrimp Scampi .. This recipe is by far the best I've EVER had. 5 star restaurant, wonderful. Thank you 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Super simple and delicious!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#My my! Oh so good! Added some fresh asparagus while sauteing garlic. By the time the shrimp were ready the asparagus was just right. My husband said this is a do over . 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Made this with chicken tonight. It was a hit. Nice fresh lemony fresh flavor. Easy to fix on a rushed night. March 2016 - Made this again but with shrimp as it should be, still a delicious and a good quick meal. April 2017 - rave reviews from family again...
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This is one of my all time favorites. Ive made this with both shrimp and with chicken (when I have no shrimp in the house). I fallow directions the same for both. Yes the shrimp is better then the chicken, but its a nice change of pace for chicken. It needs a tad more sauce for both chicken ad shrimp for us. But thats easily taken care of.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This was simple and delicious! I loved the hint of lemon. I used gluten free bread crumbs. I served this over parmesan risotto. I will definitely be making this again!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Just by reading the ingredients in a recipe, I can decipher it's caliber.This one is a winner. ; )Thank you. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Excellent and so easy and quick. Perfect and will share and make again. Thank you
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Delicious and quick. Watch for bags of frozen, peeled, deveined shrimp to go on sale (if you're landlocked like me). Agree with use of some red pepper flakes for heat, but add into the oil to flavor it. Can use white wine in place of lemon juice (or combination of the two). Add a little bit of the pasta water to make more sauce, without adding extra fat. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I love shrimp scampi and I am a critic when it comes to good tasting food! This recipe is Awesome! Easy and flavorful. The family love it. This will be my'Go to recipe' for shrimp scampi. I highly recommend it!! 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Excellent! Easy and very flavorful. I cut back on lemon juice as I am not a fan. I used garlic flavored seasoned bread crumbs as I love garlic. I paired with brown rice made with chicken broth but I can see if you were using pasta you would need to double the sauce. Will definitely make again!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Really Good and I did double the sauce as suggested. Was perfect for me.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I think I will double the butter and olive oil next time. This was very tasty but I like a little more sauce for my pasta!!!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Amazing! It was so easy to make and wowed everyone! Will definitely make again!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This is an excellent shrimp scampi. I would suggest go less on the lemon juice.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I made this just as the recipe said, and my husband and I loved it! He loves angel hair pasta and even suggested I make this dish more often!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I just had to have a little more substantial pasta and used linguine. I could eat this stuff every day!!!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This is the best version of Shrimp Scampi I have ever had. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you Lori Packer for sharing this recipe. The only thing I did differently is add a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes before adding the cheese, bread crumbs and parsley.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Mom and hubby really liked it!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I made this just as the recipe called, except used a generous teaspoon of chopped fresh oregano because I have an abundance of it in my garden. I also used the thinner fetticini noodles because my husband hates angel hair pasta. The recipe was fabulous and will definitely be making this the next time all my children are home.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I have been making this one for years and it is one of my favorites. Nice, light version. Just the right amount of butter/oil. Now if I can only get the price of shrimp down...
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This was a family pleaser. Howerver , I did add more butter and olive oil to make a sauce for the angel hair pasta. This was great with a salad and some french bread!
Shrimp Scampi#1#0#My entire family loved this recipe and will definitely fix it again! Next time I am going to try putting the pasta in the bottom of the pan before broiling because it got cold before I finished the shrimp. Was making double the recipe and did it in two batches.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#My sister and brother-in-law rated this recipe Yum! Yum!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#we have made this several times over the passed several years after I found this recipe on here, every time my parents visit or we visit them (maybe twice a year) they have me make this, everyone one loves it including the picky toddler and hubby, fixing it again tonight :-)
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This is very good
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#My husband loved it! A little too much lemon juice though, next time I will only do 1/8 cup instead of the full 1/4 cup :) Overall very nice
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This was great. I didn't put it under the broiler, though, I just mixed in the bread crumbs and the mixed with the angel hair pasta. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This was super-easy to make and absolutely delicious!! Why pay $15 a plate at a restaurant when I could feed the whole family this delicious meal for under $10?!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Why did it take me so long to find this recipe? It's so simple to make and it tastes wonderful. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#A very simple and delicious dish... The whole family loved it!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Wow.. This was really good! I added halved mushrooms and used Italian Seasoning instead of Parsley. Can't wait to have it again. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Excellent! Will definitely make again. Added a side salad and glass of wine to complement the meal.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#OMG! I make this all the time! It is wonderfull!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Awesome dish! Simple ingredients, easy and quick, but tastes divine!! Recipe immediately bumped to my top 10! Served with steamed broccoli and garlic bread.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Very good recipe, may have to try adding white wine or more butter--I'm thinking that the wine would be better. Delicious and very easy! 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I have been making a version of this for years. To make the sauce stretch I add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of white wine. My choice is a good Chardonnay!! Love the bread crumbs on top, very glad I found your version!!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Tried this dish tonight and I personally enjoyed it! It was quick and easy another keeper.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This was a great recipe. I really impressed my mother-in-law when I made it for dinner. I wish I would have made this when I still lived in Florida. Key West pinks would have been even more amazing with this recipe.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#absolutely delicious. i also added a little more butter and olive oil.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Delicious! I made this exactly as written and we loved it. One change that I will make next time will be to double the sauce ingredients to better cover the pasta.
Shrimp Scampi#0#1#This is a favorite recipe. The only change I make to it is that I mix up a package of alfredo sauce mix and add that to the pasta before serving with the scamp. Such an elegant dish, that I serve to guests. They will never guess it only takes minutes to prepare. I have even made it for people who don't enjoy seafood and watched them go back for seconds. Would highly recommend this recipe with the addition of the alfredo sauce. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This has become a favourite recipe. The only thing I change about it, is that I make up a package mix of alfredo sauce and add that to the pasta before I top it with the scampi. Such an elegant recipe that I serve it to guests and they love it, never guessing it only takes minutes to put together. I have served it people who don't like seafood and had them go back for seconds. Would highly recommend with the added alfredo sauce mix! 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Loved the taste,had to make some changes for next time....not enough sauce, will ad white wine, use less lemon juice, will use less bread crumbs, thinks just a sprinkle across top to broil and brown is good enough. Also, recipe, did not mention pasta amount used in this dish. I used a pound, for 4 people.AAlthough I tripled the recipe....I love left overs. Also, stored Scampi seperately, so that pasta didnot absorb sauce. Very easy recipe, and quick to boot. Thanks....A crowd pleaser, served with salad and garlic bread with melted mozzarella.....just yummy!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Yummy! Super easy! A new family favorite!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Really the best recipe I've come across for Shrimp scampi in years!! Quick and easy, too! My family said that this will replace several of their favorite recipes (even my lasagna)!! 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I have made this many times and it is always a hit. Excellent recipe!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#We loved this! So easy. Did not use pasta just eat it with roasted veggies and salad. Will make again!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Simple and delicious. We will definitely have this again. Next time I may try replacing the lemon juice with white wine.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This was very good, it was a fast and easy dish to make! Thanks!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This was very good, it was a fast and easy dish to make! Thanks!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#enjoyed the mix of flavors, though I will use about half the amount of lemon juice next time, only because I don't really care for lemon flavor 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#children, friends say it tastes as if it was ordered in the restaurant. Easy to prepare and every morsel is eaten. I have also used chicken instead of the shrimp
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Family loved it. Made a double batch for 5 people and it was gone in one meal.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Very good and VERY simple. I used about half the lemon juice, a little more garlic,so red pepper flakes and about 1/2 cup of white wine. I was worried that adding the bread crumbs was going to soak up all the sauce. I was wrong. Just sprinkling them with the cheese over the top, no mixing. Than broiling for color and texture wasperfect. Put over noddles, but would be great just as a scampi
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I made this for my family tonight and they loved it! It was the best! I will definitely keep this one.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I have been making this recipe for a few years now...it's a favorite of the whole family. The only thing i do different is adding alot more fresh lemon juice. It really is great try it! 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Excellent recipe and so easy. I used asiago cheese because I didn't have parmisian. Also used red pepper flakes instead of pepper. Omitted the bread crumbs. After broiling I added the pasta and stirred to coat the pasta. Delicious! 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I use this recipe all the time, so easy to prepare. I also use scallops in place of the shrimp.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Forgot to add I especially liked the ease of the preparation!  So good AND easy!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Loved it! Family loved it. One child doesn't like shrimp but loved the pasta dished out without shrimp. Usually make pasta with Alfredo sauce but this is a much lower calorie choice. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Was good, and definately quick and easy. Turned out a little too salty for our taste, would probably cut back on the butter some next time. Otherwise, good flavor and the bread crumbs and cheese make it better than the usual shrimp scampi.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#My family loved this recipe. i did add more shrimp than called for, because my three yr old loves them.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Agreed that it needed more sauce. The 2nd time I made it I added a bit more olive oil and butter. Also used cooked, small Maine shrimp and it was so yummy! It's on its way to becoming a favorite around my house! 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#My 12 year old son loves this delicious dish. He likes the honey grilled shrimp better though.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Made for New Years Eve for the family and was a huge hit. Broiling it was what gave it that special touch. Will definitely make again!!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#very quick and easy....added small scallops with the shrimp...yummy!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#I omitted the bread crumbs and it was still delicious! The lemon juice really brightens the flavor of the dish.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Very simple! This was my first time making shrimp and it turned out perfect! My family raved over it! I served it as a side with a London Broil and not with pasta. Delicious!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Savory! Has become a favorite with my wife and girls (even my picky teenager)!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Even my very picky daughter came back for seconds. Super easy recipe.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This recipe is delicious! My husband and two year old twins ate it up, plus seconds! After reading the comments I increased the amount of sauce by adding about 3/4 cup white cooking wine and only put about 1/4 cup of lemon juice. I also upped the oregano and pepper. To thicken it I added a tablespoon or two of sour cream. I cooked the shrimp mixture (with frozen shrimp) and pasta on the stove and then put everything in a corningware baking dish to broil it with the bread crumbs and cheese on top. I personally thought it needed more lemon juice and added it at the table, but my kids and husband thought it was perfect without any add-ons. It was soooo easy and I will make it again. This will be a weekly staple meal in our house! And did I mention that it's pretty and good enought to serve to company! 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This was delicious! My family raved about it for days!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#My family says this is a keeper! Hubby would have liked a bit more sauce over the pasta, but otherwise it was perfect and sooo easy.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This meal is absolutely delicious! Try using Italian style bread crumbs..yum yum
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This meal was delicious! I used white wine instead of lemon juice, after reading the reviews. It was soooo good. Yummy! and easy!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This was very delicious. Broiling it in the oven was a great idea.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#very good, but i agree about the lemon, it was too much.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Delicious! However, I also used less lemon juice and added a bit more olive oil. Next time I will try it with the white wine.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#This turned out great I forgot to click on the rating stars I would have given this recipe 5 stars!
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#Turned out great! Use extra shrimp a little more butter, little less lemon and added bread crumbs to sauce before I added the shrimp. I did not broil.
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#this was absolutely delicious!!
Shrimp Scampi#0#1#This recipe was GREAT!! The only change I made was halving the lemon juice and using chicken broth for the other half so it wouldn't be so lemony. I also added fresh basil in addition to the fresh parsley. I did broil it, which I agree added a nice touch!! My family is very picky and they all agree this one is a keeper! 
Shrimp Scampi#1#1#I substituted white cooking wine for lemon juice. I used frozen cooked shrimp. As it thawed the water from the shrimp mixed with the rest of the scampi sauce and made it the perfect consistency. I did not broil it in the oven. I made it entirely on the stove. Delicious!
Shrimp Scampi#1#0#I agree with the lemon juice. I just made it. I did enjoy it; however, adding some white wine and subtracting some lemon juice would enhance the recipe. I mixed the bread crumbs, cheese, and parsley together before adding to shrimp. The broiling was a nice touch.
Shrimp Scampi#2#0#This is something I would want to try, except, any good scampi has dry white wine. Without the wine it is flat.Give it a try with the wine. Make sure you cook the wine off at least 10 minutes.
Shrimp Scampi#1#0#I would substitute white wine for most of that lemon juice. That's way too much for a pound of shrimp. 
Shrimp Scampi#0#0#My family and I thought it had way to much lemon juice. I suggest start out with 2 T first then add more to taste.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Hello, we usually use scales in Europe and the U.K.; can someone kindly tell me how to measure the cups of flour - is it scoop and level or spoon flour into the cup and level. Many thanks 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#20#2#Did anyone else take more then 45 min For custard to set
Rhubarb Custard Bars#3#0#These are the best bars I've ever made and tasted! So easy,super delicious! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#4#4#I am always looking for a good rhubarb recipe and this one is so delicious! I made these bars for friends for a Memorial Day cookout and they were a hit. The tart rhubarb and the sweet topping are a perfect match. I pulled them out of the oven and allowed to cool for about 1 hour before serving them warm with the creamy topping. My husband ate one cold for breakfast the next morning. I will freeze the rest for later.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#4#Anyone know if you can freeze the bars and frost later, when ready to use? Thanks!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#10#1#Add 1 TBS Cherry Grand Marnier or in place of the vanilla in the topping and Drambuie to the custard for a nice twist.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#17#4#These are wonderful just as written! (or a tad more rhubarb) I waited to write my review because I froze some as there is just the two of us and I wanted to see how well they were after freezing. Well, after 4 months in the freezer they were perfect! My husband said to be sure to keep this recipe, and he doesn't even like rhubarb. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#3#0#I make these on a regular basis and I follow the directions as is with just a bit more rhubarb!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#3#0#i need to halve the recipe - some ingredients are easily halved, but instead of 3 eggs, use 2? also i measure flour by weight (5oz=1cup) - so 7 tbls (an odd way to measure flour!) is 2.3/8 oz (level tbsp), so halve that? thanks for any thoughts!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#9#2#Made exactly as recipe called. They are delicious!!! Next time I will use fresh rhubarb and use more. The frosting was so creamy! My husband thought they were delicious also but would like more of the rhubarb. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#2#0#Nice one
Rhubarb Custard Bars#2#0#These are so good. I've been making it for 15 years ever since I found it. My family loves them. When rhubarb season is here. They are made. If I get really busy, I use canned cream cheese frosting. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#3#1#I love these bars, sometimes I add 1 cup of either raspberries or strawberries to the rhubarb to change things up. They are delicious either way.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#4#2#Tracy you can also use the following measure: one cup of diced raw rhubarb equals 0.27 lb. of raw diced rhubarb.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#2#Tracy, 1 cup of liquid is usually 8 ounces or 230 ml, where as 1 cup of white granulated sugar weighs 7 ounces. Here is a conversion chart that you might find helpful. This recipe is yummy, but I would increase the rhubarb in the filling, and decrease the whipping cream in the topping, it was over baring.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#15#0#Can anyone please tell me the weight of a cup as we don't use this measure in England.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#5#0#Theses were fabulous. I picked my rhubarb in the morning. I made the 1/2 recipe more tart version and they were liked by all. I agree that people who think they don't like rhubarb would love these. So different!!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#40#21#Can these rhubarb bars be frozen after baking?
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#1#Very tasty, I usually don't like rhubarb.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#4#0#SO GOOD! The shortbread crust is a little labor intensive, but worth making! My new favotie rhubard recipe!!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#I tried this recipe for the first time but it will definitely not be the last. This has become one of my favorite rhubarb recipes. It's sweet, creamy and a touch of tart. the recipe is so easy to make. i highly recommend trying this recipe. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I have not made this yet, but it sounds delish. I have a lot of home canned rhubarb that is kind of like sauce. How can I use that in this recipe?
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#So yummy!! Everyone I shared with asked for the recipe!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#This recipe is wonderful and a refreshing summer treat. The first time I made this recipe I used fresh rhubarb, but the second time it wasn't available and had to buy frozen. Still in the process of making it, but I'm sure it will be fine as long as it's completely drained. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Absolutely delicious!!! My kids loved them!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#These are fabulous! Simple to make and so delicious! These have become a family favorite and requested often. I now buy lots of rhubarb when it is in season and chop and freeze just for this dish.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I made these exactly as written and THEY WERE AMAZING! The recipe definitely makes a lot of them (they're rich, so cutting them smaller is fine). I took them to two different events this past weekend and they were a huge hit at both. I'm definitely making these again! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#3#0#Love, love, love this recipe, but the topping makes it too sweet. I make with either a meringue or drizzle a glaze on it. Fabulous recipe!!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#3#0#Delicious!!! I made this once ( just as it is) and it got such great reviews from my family that i put it in my recipe box. I would suggest a very large 9x13 baking dish because it makes a lot. I will try cutting it in half the next time. A great way to use rhubarb!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#2#1#Delicious!! I cut the recipe in half and put in a 9-inch square pan. I used almost 4 cups of rhubarb and I wish I would have used more. The crust is nice and sweet and the custard really goes well with the tart rhubarb. I didn't have the ingredients for the topping so I just used whipped cream. It was really tasty. Next time I am going to make the regular topping with the cream cheese and increase the rhubarb to 5 cups for a half size batch. YUM!! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#I make this and my dad makes it we just don't put the topping on it's a big hit. My dad makes one every week to take to local diner and they ask him to bring in more every time. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I printed the recipe and noticed the crust calls for 1 cup cold butter TWICE and the filling calls for 5 cups of rhubarb TWICE. You may want to review and redo the ingredients listed.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#1#Absolute favorite in our home! Made this many times.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#I didn't think I liked rhubarb until I tried this recipe! Yum! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#This deserves 10 stars!!!!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#When I read this recipe I read the tips at the end and said to myself I have rosewater, I'm totally doing that but then when I was creating the filling I forgot, so I added it to the topping. OMG! So good!! I had trouble getting it looking like pretty bars, maybe I need to make it again? I totally reccomend adding the rose water! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Very tasty but the crust was really rich. When I make it again, I would make it with a thinner crust base (1/2-2/3).
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#2#These bars are winners! I substituted Cool Whip for the whipping cream...still great!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Everyone loved this recipe. People raved about this even people that do not like rhubarb
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Oh, so good
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I would recommend this recipe as one of the best Rhubarb bars.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Easy to make! It was delicious!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#2#0#This is definitely a 5-star dessert! It is similar to my mother-in-laws custard rhubarb pie, so maybe that's why we loved it so much. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#1#These were delicious. I reduced the rhubarb and added some chopped strawberries because they are a great combination. I also used an entire package of cream cheese in the frosting, I think it helps it from being too sweet.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#4#0#These bars surprised me. I liked them much more than I thought I would. I made them for a Support Group I go to and I bake each month and I like to try something different.I think the next time I make these, and there will be many more next times...I am going to increase the amount of rhubarb. I think it can use almost double. but I will start with 7 cups and see if it could still use more.I did the custard part in my blender, much smoother than whisking in a bowl. Once it was blended smooth I poured it into the same bowl the base has been mixed in then stirred in the rhubarb.I did make 1 change to the frosting. I used a full package, 8 ounces, of cream cheese. I thought what the heck am I going to do with 2 ounces of cream cheese! The frosting was great . I do not think the extra 2 ounces mad a difference. I did not increase the sugar or the cream and I can not imagine the frosting being any better than it was.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#2#0#I like strawberries and rhubarb together, but wondered if anyone has tried this recipe with just strawberries or blueberries?
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#My mom first introduced me to these bars years ago - and I've since started making them. So good! I've even turned non-rhubarb eaters onto this bar. Love that they stay fresh in the fridge for many days. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#3#0#It was easy to make and very tasty. I halved the crust, and used 1/2&1/2 instead of whipping cream and lessened the sugar (I always do in desserts) and it was very good! I also had to bake it close to an hour. Thanks for sharing!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#2#0#I love anything rhubarb and had a lot to use this year. I had to bake closer to an hour but the end result was very good. Will definitely make this again.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#3#2#I love anything with rhubarb but have to include strawberries. I cut down the 5 cups of rhubarb to 4 and added 2 cups of chopped strawberries and used 8 ounces of cream cheese instead of just 6. Everyone that has had them say they are beyond awesome.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#My favorite rhubarb recipe! Family and friends love it!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#I would describe this as a dessert you eat with a fork as opposed to a bar. Took a lot longer than 45 minutes to cook. Crust too thick. But still very good!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#2#0#Amazing recipe! My husband and I visit this small Amish/Mennonite restaurant and I always get their Rhubarb Custard Pie. This reminds me of that pie, but so much easier to make. To cut back on calories, I omitted the frosting and just drizzled a very thin vanilla frosting over the top and I was happy with the result. This will be my go to recipe from now on, replacing the rhubarb custard pie I usually make. Thanks for sharing this.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#1#I made these today without changing a thing.....simply decadent!!!!!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#best rhubarb recipe I ever tried
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I have been saving this recipe to try for years and was so happy when I saw rhubarb at the farmer's market last week. These were delicious and I will be making them again! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#These are absolutely wonderful! However, I don't call them bars, I served them as a dessert on a plate with a fork. Too tall and soft to eat with your fingers. Although, they are finger licking delicious! Rich? Yes? Yummy? You bet!! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I made this recipe yesterday and the only thing I would do different from now on is to cut the crust ingredients in half - I thought the crust was too thick.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#2#1#I love the filling of this recipe. Instead of the cream cheese frosting, I make a meringue topping. Delish!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#This was amazing ... made it for Easter today and LOVED it. I cut down on sugar for both the custard filling and the topping, and it's perfect. Will definitely make this again!! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#MJFUSA you could use half & half or whole milk instead. Anything lower fat and you'll risk the texture of the custard. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#I made this yesterday for dessert at a pot luck dinner of 14 people. EVERYONE loved it and commented that it was very satisfying and not too sweet.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#2#Is there a possible substitute for the CUPS of heavy whipping cream-- too rich for my family- need to tone it down a bit?
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Whoever came up with this recipe is an absolute genius. They are very rich, otherwise they would all be gone in no time at our house !
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#These are so good! They have moved into the favorite category! I don't change anything. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Absolutely delicious. Rave reviews from everyone!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#cool one
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#2#My family loves this recipe. I get asked for the recipe where ever I bring this dessert. I use the whole 8 oz package of cream cheese and cool whip instead of whipped cream.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#These were very good. I agree with some of the other reviews that there is too much crust and I would make more of the filling. I liked them better without the frosting but that is my personal preference not because the frosting wasn't good. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#My family loved these bars! I wish I would have halved the recipe and cooked in a 9x9 or 8x8 pan. These bars are very rich!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#1#Has anyone tried making these, up to the frosting step, and freezing them? Just wondering if that would work, then thaw & put the ream cheese mixture on then.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#1#I had been wanting to make these bars for some time and I'm so glad I finally tried them! They are outstanding! I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and baked them in an 8x8-inch pan. I also added a sprinkling of nutmeg (my grandma always did that with her rhubarb desserts). I can see why this is a Top Ten Rhubarb recipe and Dessert recipe! I will definitely be making these delicious bars again! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I'm pretty sure these bars changed my life. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#This is the first review I have submitted, these bars are the best rhubarb dessert I have had. I will continue to make these. I did not change anything in this recipe.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I'm so used to boiling rhubarb I didn't read the recipe first. Mine had rhubarb disributed evenly through them and they tasted very good too. I won'boil them next time I make this. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#These were absolutely delish! I love strawberry rhubarb pie so I cut the rhubarb to 4 cups and added 2 cups of strawberries. I used fresh rhubarb and fresh strawberries. I think frozen would have added too much moisture. There is a lot of sugar but it was worth it. Next time I'll use whipped cream and lose the extra 1/2 cup of sugar. Also, 36 bars from a 13x9 baking dish makes them more like cubes. If you are counting carbs 1 bar is more like 70 carbs. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#These bars are awesome. The rhubarb taste is lovely. I did cut back on the amount of sugar in the filling - but just because I like it a little more tart. I am going to try cutting back about 1/4 on the base ingredients just so it is not quite so thick. Thank you for a great recipe! We will be enjoying these often.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#These are very rich but very tasty. I'm not a fan of the cream cheese so I leave the cream cheese out and top with the sweetened whip cream with a touch of vanilla (I leave out a little of the sugar from the topping) 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I made these today for my birthday treat. I thought they were great. The whole family gave them 5 stars! They were worth the little extra time it took to make them!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I made this recipe and took it to work. Everyone loved it. This is a keeper
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#So disappointed. Lots of work, beautiful results----very bland in taste
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Delicious! The shortbread crust is easy to make, the filling moist, and the rhubarb adds just the right amount of tanginess. I will definitely make this recipe again, perhaps even using different kinds of fruit instead of rhubarb!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#2#0#Fabulous dessert for a recent dinner party. I added nutmeg to the shortbread crust, and as others suggested; 6 cups of rhubarb. Yes, it makes a lot and if I were preparing it for a smaller amount of folks, I would halve the recipe.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#great bars. I also use sliced canned or fresh peaches and sprinkle chopped nuts on top. I don't frost mine. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Love these bars, fantastic! Used 6 cups of rhubarb...
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Delicious! Great old fashioned dessert that my grandkids really enjoyed.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#Love it! I made it as shown and everyone loved it, but wanted a little more of the rhubarb. I will use 6 cups rhubarb next time.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#These were wonderful.. I did add more sugar to both the crust and filling but didn't frost the bars. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#This is a great recipe. Nice and creamy, the rhubarb is very mellow and the topping is not too sweet. This will go into my keeper recipes. I made the recipe exactly as is and didn't make any changes. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#wonderful recipe. Even those who don't like rhubarb like this dessert. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#My new FAVORITE rhubarb recipe!!!!!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Yummy
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#These bars are dangerous!!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#very good
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#1#I added a Tablespoon of cinnamon and a Teaspoon of Cloves to the rhubarb. Next time, I'll add even more. Very good. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#very good but for a crowd
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#These bars are one of the best things I've ever tasted. I've switched up the fruit too. Equally delicious 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#So, so delicious, my 7 year old says it's her favorite dessert EVER! She loves it more than birthday cake even. :-) 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Best Rhubarb dessert EVER! We are not really rhubarb fans, but in honor of my grandfather's rhubarb plant, which each of his grandchildren keep growing in our yards (been around for a good 80 years now!) I try to make something every year. Well THIS year, I have made this recipe six times already! It is absolutely delicious. The shortbread crust and subtle custard filling are sublime. If you love rhubarb, this will be your favorite recipe, and if you don't, it still might be your favorite dessert recipe! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#Yummy! First batch went so fast, I had to make another, immediately. Both times, I just realized, I failed to bake the crust, and it obviously turned out great anyway. The 2nd time, I wanted more custardy filling, so added 1/4 cup milk., too. We had a house-full of people, so it makes enough. I will be bringing this to pot-lucks, for sure. It certainly was NOT bland. We used freshly picked rhubarb. We all loved the shortbread crust. I feel this was an easy recipe and quick, but then, I had my rhubarb already cut and didn't bake the crust before adding the filling. It tastes more custardy when eaten warm. It sets up a bit when chilled. It would be yummy even without the topping, I am sure. A big hit, here! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#Fabulous! My family asks for this. Rhubarb is the key ingredient here. I mix the sugar & flour & rhubarb (more like 6 cups chopped VERY FINE) and let it set while I prepare the other parts. When making the cookie bottom I don't press it down real tight. For sure, don't overbake the bottom. It's better to eat it like fall apart cake than to have it overcooked & dry. Ask me how I know. Smile. Also, bake it in glass, not metal. I love Jaslyn's suggestions & I plan to try them but this recipe is great as is. It tastes great warm out of the oven AND cold the next day. Oh, and it makes a lot. It could easily be halved. And one more thing, I have been making these bars since the recipe was first published in the magazines in 1988 I just never added a rating. Taste of Home fan here! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#2#This is a very yummy way to use up some rhubarb. I added some cinnamon and nutmeg into the custard part of the bars and cut the sugar just a tad. I also used a whole brick of cream cheese and more like 1.5 cups of heavy cream for the whipped cream part of the topping, and I think next time I will just double the topping part altogether ~ it is SO GOOD! All in all, this recipe is a definite keeper. Next time I will also up the sugar in the crust just a smidge, as that part still needs something more . 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I first tasted this at a potluck dinner. It is wonderful.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#The best 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#meh. I agree with another user that this recipe is quite bland. Not very sweet. When you bite into the bars, there is a beautifully creamy, fluffy texture, but not much flavor. The crust is the best part, I think. Tastes like shortbread cookies. The custard section seems to be missing something. This recipes was really a lot of work. I do not plan to make these again.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#So easy and absolutely delicious!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#Loved these! Next time I will try to have the rhubarb chopped ahead of time, otherwise they were a fairly quick to make desert. I did add walnuts, but otherwise followed the recipe. They were a big hit!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#Made these with strawberries and rhubarb and they came out great. Can they be made with any other fruits?? Rhubarb is not available long enough and I don't have a freezer. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I haven't made this yet but I love rhubarb so will be making it soon and I'm pretty sure it will rate 5 stars. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#These are GREAT. Everyone LOVED them!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I made this for a family reunion and it went over very well. Recipe is definitely a keeper.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#The bars are alright but nothing special. I used just one cup of sugar in the filling and it turned out fine. I think the crust is too thick. The topping doesn't add much to the recipe and I think it is unnecessary. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#Made these tonight, very good!!! When I was at the store getting stuff for this, I did not read it carefully when it came to the cream cheese. I grabbed two 8oz pkgs., but I did notice it before I made the frosting. Just used one 8oz pkg, turned out great. I was too eager to frost and eat the bars, so the frosting got a little warm and melty but after putting it in the fridge, everything turned out great!!! Easy recipe and very delicious!!! Also, the crust was good, did not think it was too thick.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#Very good! I followed the recipe as written. The crust could have baked about 3-4 minutes longer but that may have been my oven. I took this to a potluck without having made the recipe before; that's always a gamble! I received numerous compliments and a few requests for the recipe. Tell-tale vote was in the fact that I took home an empty pan! The bars were sweet but the tartness of the rhubarb balances it out and dessert was light tasting. I also appreciated that real whipped cream and not artificial topping was used. It gave the bars a richer taste than the artificial plastic tasting topping would. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#1#awesome
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Wonderful and lots of rhubarb.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#I have always Loved the Rhubarb Torte my Mom always makes, but not a fan of Meringue; in which I took off. This recipe tastes just like her torte, except for a light fluffy cream cheese frosting. My New Favorite!!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#This is the best rhubarb recipe I have ever made!! Love It!!!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#Made this for a graduation party, and everyone loved it! Instead of 5 cups of rhubarb, I used 3 cups of rhubarb and 2 cups of chopped strawberries. I only used about 1/4 cup of sugar to the topping, and both pkgs of cream cheese; the not so sweet topping offset the sweet center. Plan to use this with straight strawberries, then blackcaps, and follow it up in late summer with peaches--I think they will all be awesome!!! New keeper recipe!!!!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I made these for a Memorial Day get together, everyone loved these bars, but I used 8 ounces of cream cheese .
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#1#A new favorite, expect for the topping I used 4 ounces of cream cheese, 1/2 powder sugar, 1 tsp vanilla beaten together and then 1 8 ounce cool whip folded in. YUMMO!!!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#4#haven't made these due to the huge amount of cream in both filling and frosting. has anyone made them with half and half in the filling? 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#This was great. At our Mother's Day BBQ it got rave reviews from everyone 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#My first rhubarb dessert for this season, the crust and the filling were wonderful! The topping was good but there was way too much of it. I only put half of it on and it was still over powering. One package of cream cheese would have been plenty. Family suggested we just use cool whip next time so we could taste the rhubarb. I will make again. Thanks for the recipe.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#These were great!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I wasn't paying attention and did not have any heavy cream. And thought the cream was suppose to be in the bars. I used vanilla greek yogurt in the filling and about 8 ounces of Cool Whip in the frosting. These bars turned out excellent. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Sounds like a wonderful recipe.... BUT can I substitute FRESH strawberries? I don't have Rhubarb on hand and the store is 40 miles away. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Absolutely amazing, I begged for the recipe last year after having one at the horse show food stand!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#oh this is very similar to my favorite pie recipe for rhubarb - Rhubarb Custard Pie -= only that recipe has some nutmeg in it... I think I'm going to give this a try since it only gets rave reviews too!!!! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I made this recipe after reading all the great reviews. I was very disappointed in these bars All the butter and whipping cream overpowered the rhubarb. There is way too much crust for this recipe, half the amount would be much better. Also, since these bars have to be stored in the fridge, the chilled crust ended up being hard. Would not make these again. I'll save my rhubarb for recipes where the rhubarb can really shine. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#1#I have been making this EVERY year when the rhubarb is ready...This is the ONLY rhubarb recipe I make! It never disappoints, even the finickiest rhubarb eaters LOVE it...I should say that I still have the original recipe from the 1998 TOH magazine! That's a long time to make over and over...try it, you won't be dissapointed. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#OUTSTANDING. I used frozen rhubarb that I had thoroughly squeezed out. It came out so great that I don't think I'd want to take a chance using raw rhubarb...would it set as well? Would it release too much liquid?I'm already thinking of other things to sub in...can you imagine this with plump, rum-soaked raisins? Oh, my goodness.I wouldn't change anything else about this recipe. It's simply perfect. And it comes together very easily. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Delicious!!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I've made this recipe a few times and got RAVE reviews! I get requests for this ALL the time!!! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I mixed rhubarb and fresh blueberries together and added alittle cinnamon to the custard. YUM is all I can say. I have made them with just rhubarb for 12 years.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#The BEST rhubarb recipe you will EVER taste!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Everyone who has eaten these bars just loves them, even if they are not fans of rhubarb. Very good!!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#These are awesome. I have made these for several years and I always get complimented on them and asked for the recipe.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Made this for a potluck and it was a hit! Definitely will make it again! YUM!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#This recipe is hands down my all time favorite that I got from Taste of Home over the past 12 years! I have substituted fresh blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries...each to die for!!!! EVERYONE, and I mean EVERYONE loves and requests these!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Again and again and again.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I make these bars every year when my rhubarb is ready. I am never disappointed.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I make these bars every year when my rhubarb is ready. I am never disappointed.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I absolutely loved this recipie!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Definately a keeper, not to sweet - just perfect. The texture was nice. My frosting was way runnier than what is pictured. I will decrease the whipping cream next time.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#These are to die for. I sometimes use Cool whip for the frosting instead of heavy cream in hopes of cutting calories :) I dare not make them too often since I can't stop eating them. HEAVENLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#These bars are delicious. Next time I make this I won't add the full cup of cream to the topping as I found it softer than what I would like. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I love this recipe, and I make it every spring, as soon as my rhubarb is ready to be picked. I added 2 cups of fresh sliced strawberries and an extra tablespoon of flour to the filling.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I found this recipe awhile back.. NOW it is a MUST to make a few times during the growing season.. MY family loves this! It is nice change from the regular recipes I have found.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#These are the best rhubarb bars!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#These are wonderful and we enjoy them without the topping. Delicious!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Oh my gosh, these were so good! Our family loves rhubarb and this recipe just went to the top of my list! Be sure to have the recipe handy when you serve these as everyone will ask for it!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#This is such a delicious recipe for rhubarb. Ymmy. One of my favorite spring time recipes!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#These bars were really good. The crust is very tasty. It's also good without the topping. I added 2 Tbs. Strawberry gelatin to the filling, mixing in with the sugar & flour. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I took this divine dessert to work this week---the girls LOVED it and wanted the recipe....they didn't even want to share with other departments!! The pan emptied FAST! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I make these every spring, Soooo good.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Delicious. Creamy and moist dessert. Love the topping.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I've also been making these bars since they first came out in the magazine. They are outstanding! Creamy, rich, with a wonderful texture. Loved by young and old, they are even requested for birthdays! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I first made these bars a few years ago and they became an instant favorite of my family's. These are the BEST bars ever!!! 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#I LOVE these bars and so does everyone who has tried them. One lady ate the whole pan over the course of a couple of days and then about died when she say the fat content in them. My sis-in-law who swears she doesn't like rhubarb loves them as well. I've been making them ever since the recipe came out and will continue to make it. 
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Just love these bars. They have to be my favorite way to use rhubarb.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#Great Bars...have been making these since they first appeared around 1999 in The Taste of HomeMag. recipe section. !!!!!!!!
Rhubarb Custard Bars#0#0#So delicious!!! Will definately make these again.
Rhubarb Custard Bars#1#0#Have made these for years but in a jelly roll pan (they get thinner) & its become 1 of our top 2 rhubarb favorites! Everyone ALWAYS asks for the recipe!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Has anyone tried freezing it and then thawing it for later use?
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#1#Why is the batter runny? Made it just like it says, room temp eggs, soft cream cheese. Is it not enough sugar, added the half cup like recipe says
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#6#1#I have made this many times, but I cook it on my smoker, it will cause a fight over the last piece
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#7#6#I can't rate because I haven't made it yet, but it looks absolutely delish! Has anyone tried making it in a rectangle pan and cut into bars? What size pan and how long to bake? 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#2#0#Need to bake longer. Watch until golden brown and set. Too good!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#7#1#I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! It's not overly sweet, like a pecan pie sometimes is. I used Hershey's caramel topping. It wasn't fat free. Otherwise, followed directions with the exception of time. I read another review that said to bake longer and I did, about 8-10 minutes. It was awesome! It's neat how the syrup moves to the bottom under the cheesecake. I love that magic! Anyway, super easy with limited ingredients and great taste.... just add a little more time. Like the other review said, jiggly on top in the middle should be fine!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#4#2#I have found out a few things making this recipe. 1) use ice cream topping (I used Smuckers) and NOT SYRUP. The syrup doesn't set up. 2) it needs to cook about 15 minutes longer than the recipe says. Always delicious and a new favorite.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#2#0#I find this recipe my new go to! Everyone loves it! If you read the reviews saying it was a runny mess...don't be alarmed, my first one was too. There is nothing wrong with the pie, if you get a runny mess try again because you didn't cook it long enough. That being said, even though my first one was a runny mess, I was STILL asked to make it again! I've had luck adding 10 mins to the cook time give or take. It should still move in the middle slightly but it shouldn't be too jiggly. It's tough to tell with this one when it's done. When you get it right it's amazing! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#1#4#Well now I have made it and it only gets 1 star, it really doesn't deserve a star at all.Very disappointed. Followed the recipe to the T. Refrigerated over night cut into it today and its nothing but a runny mess. I still tastes okay but I will from now own stick to my Karo syrup half light and half dark pecan pie recipe that always comes out perfect. Mike 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#1#2#Followed the recipe exact. Refrigerated this overnight and when I cut in to it the next morning to serve with coffee it literally ran. The inside never set and it turned out soupy! Not at all what I had expected and I can tell you that it was a complete waste of ingredients. Threw it in the garbage and I will not waste the time or ingredients again. Especially with the cost of pecans.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Easy and delicious will make during holidays
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#2#2#Please update the ingredients list. The directions include cream cheese, which is not listed in the ingredients.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#You can not see all the ingredients needed for this recipe on a phone! Not sure about a computer since I don't have ones.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#You did not include cream cheese in the ingredients. Recipe fails.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Can't wait to try this with sugar substitute. Looks so yummy and easy as 123.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#1#1#I made this delicious pie for Christmas this year. It was a big hit with the whole family.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I made this pie for Christmas dessert and it was delicious!!! So easy to make and a time saver. I made no changes to the recipe.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I made this for our Thanksgiving and was SO good made it again two days later to take to a second dinner invitation. Will permanently be on our Thanksgiving menu!!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#1#0#Absolutely delicious. I made this dessert for Thanksgiving and my family insisted I make it for Christmas. Only change I made was making graham cracker crust versus pastry crust. So easy and sooo good
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Awesome, Delicious and so easy to make. I took it to a Christmas party and they had a contest for the best dessert. I won... everyone loved it!!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#The bomb! Loved it so much, making 2 for Christmas company!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Easy to make and sooo good! I increased the cheesecake mix by 1/2 to make a thicker layer of cheese cake and put it in a deep dish pie pan. It was a hit and didn't last long. It was the first dessert to disappear on Thanksgiving. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#So easy to make and SO GOOD! I will definitely make this again. I didn't have the fat-free caramel on hand so I used the regular caramel ice cream topping and it was perfect. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Made this for Thanksgiving 2019 and it was delicious. Easy to make. It was definitely a hit on the dessert buffet. Will be making again for Christmas.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Outstanding recipe! I used a bought deep dish crust for the ease and Smucker's salted caramel topping. I tried it out on my neighbor and this is definitely a keeper recipe!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is one of my favorite dessert recipes! I've made it many times and it is always a hit. It is so simple yet tastes so delicious and is perfect for potlucks or to bring as a special treat when bringing a meal to a friend. I even brought it once as a thank you to a neighbor and they were thrilled. I've used different brands of the caramel ice cream topping and have also used regular, not non-fat. It's always delicious! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This was fantastic came out just like the picture. Make sure to use caramel topping(NOT SYRUP). I only used 2 lg. Eggs with the caramel and didnt use all of it. There is no need to drown the pecans in sauce, just enough the cover them. Cooked using a ceramic 9 pie dish at 350° with alluminum foil tented loosely for 40 min. Then removed foil and cooked an additional 20 min. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#The recipe is easy to follow and incredibly delicious! This pie will be on our Thanksgiving table again this year.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Just wondering, does it have to be Fat Free topping?
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This desert was absolutely delicious. Followed recipe directions and came out perfect. I made a few modifications such as used 3 eggs instead of 4. Baked at 350 degrees and baked for 35 minutes (no more ). I also used nilla wafer crust. SCRUMPTIOUS!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Haven't made this pie yet but was just wondering if anyone has tried making this with Salted Caramel because they were out of the Smuckers caramel topping at the store. Please Help!!!! Just want to make sure I won't ruin it. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Very delicious and was a huge hit with the family.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is absolutely delicious! I made it last year for Thanksgiving, then again for Christmas! Looks like a new tradition is born! I make it with graham cracker crust.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is super delicious!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Made this awhile back, but forgot to rate. Easy dessert to make and came out looking just like the picture. It's very good but super rich! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Haven't made it yet but it looks so delicious!! And I just have to give it give stars because my husband loves pecan pie and I love cheese cake, so this just may be out new favorite! Thanks for the recipe. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I hosted a pie party and this was th pie that I baked . It was so delishous everyone was asking for the recipe . To this day my friends still request this scrumptious pie .
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#1#Regarding Andrews89: If it was eggy and lumpy, it's possible your oven runs hotter than the dial; get an oven thermometer and check the temperature settings. It's also possible you didn't beat the cheesecake mixture long enough. Check out those things and try again. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I've been making a pie like this since the 80's, except it's called Mystery Pecan Pie and has no caramel in it. It is delicious. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#very easy to make, looks like the picture, will make again
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#1#did everything just like the directions said I was extra careful to watch my time too as to not burn or over cook accidently but it just dint come out quite right the cheesecake part dint have that classic cheesecake velvety taste to it more eggy and lumpy not sure what I did wrong?
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#1#i was very intimidated it was my first time making something from scratch I made it on Thanksgiving my whole family loved it and they were very disappointed on Christmas when I made something else it really is a hit and it's so easy to make and I bought all the ingredients to make it again 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#1#Excellent!! To the other reader that mentioned about the caramel layer on bottom when a cream cheese went down first. Mine ended up with a caramel layer on the bottom so, it must separate itself. It turned out looking exactly like the photo and tasted as good as it looked.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Delicious pie. I don't really care for the standard pecan pie, but I really enjoyed this, as did my family and guests. I followed the recipe and no problems of any kind. Used graham cracker crust to save time. Excellent ! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Question: does the pie separate into layers as it bakes? The. Pix shows a caramel layer on the bottom but the directions say put the cream cheese mixture in first.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is a favorite when I take it to Church dinners. I make it for 2 friends on their birthdays instead of cake.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This recipe is great! The pie smells as delicious as it tastes.. I will definitely be making this one again. I put it in a graham cracker crust, and it was off the wall. I do, however have a couple tips to the people who claim the pie was too runny or eggy. When mixing the cheese filling, make sure you beat it smooth as the instructions say. It may take quite a bit of doing, considering you are dealing with cream cheese, especially if it isnt softened completely. Make sure there are no chunks left and that it is nice and whipped. The same goes for the caramel topping. I also only used 2 and a half eggs instead of 3 in the topping mixture. let the pecans swim, but dont drown them. I didnt completely use the entire topping mixture on mine. Finally, make sure your cheesecake is completely baked to the middle, and make sure you cool and refridge the pie for the proper amount of time.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I made this today to share with some friends and everyone loved it. The only change I made was that I substituted homemade brown sugar caramel for the store bought topping. Its the easy caramel sauce on the Pioneer Woman site, and it literally only takes five minutes to make. Just make sure to let it come to room temperature before letting it touch the eggs, and keep it a little on the runny side - it will thicken a bit as it comes to room temperature, and you don't want it too thick when you mix it with the eggs. The pie was great - a perfect blend of several wonderful tastes and textures. I give it five stars. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#2#I followed the instruction exactly as written and it was honestly the worst dessert Iand#39;ve ever made. I was embarrassed when I sent it with my husband for his cookout and he told me it was awful. I tried it and I threw out the entire thing (6 pieces left). I wish I could give it 0 stars. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Easy to make and so good! The first pie to disappear at thanksgiving this year. Everyone loved it!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#My pie seemed a little eggy. What size eggs did you use ? I also had to bake 15 min. Longer to bake the center.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I made four pies for this past Thanksgiving weekend to be served with three different gatherings - husband's family, my family, and our church family. Each location this pie was an absolute hit, and everyone wanted the recipe. I saved a wee bit of time and used Marie Callender's frozen deep dish pie crusts. They worked beautifully, but do note they are 8oz crusts and not 9oz. I wasn't able to use all the caramel mixture on the pie - in fact, 3 caramel mixtures were plenty for the 4 pies. It didn't affect the taste at all. This pie was amazing. Even my non-dessert eating husband tried some and really liked it! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This was a hit at thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. I poured only about 3/4 of the Carmel on the pie, and I wish I hadn't. Next time I'll use the whole jar. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#By far my favorite pie ever! Follow the instructions to a'T,' you will not need to change a thing! It has become the most requested dessert at our family holidays over the last few years! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is truly an excellent dessert, One bite and you will be hooked.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is a terrific recipe. I have made this numerous times for various occasions and it is always the quickest to disappear. It has consistently been great every time. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Made this for a pie contest at work - went over really well. Not as sweet as I thought it would be which suited me fine - don't like overly sweet things. Will definitely make it again. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Amazing on every level! No need to bother with the fat free stuff! :-)
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Does it actually HAVE to be sugar-free caramel topping or will reg. Smuckers work? I want to try it for Thanksgiving.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is the best pecan ever. My husband always wants pecan pie for his birthday and after I made this one it is the only he asks for. Everyone in family loves this pie. We give this pie 10 stars. Easy to make and always turns out great.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This pie was such a hit at Thanksgiving that I decided to make it again for Christmas. I did and the results were disappointing to say the least. Neither pie set correctly--they came out unbelievably runny. Then I stumbled across a review of this recipe from jiminy97 on Feb. 03, 2012. They had the same results as my Christmas fiasco--runny pies. The only thing we did alike was make 2 at the same time. My guess is for best results--prepare 1 pie at a time should be added to the recipe. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This recipe OMG good!!! It was a big hit for my Christmas dinner this year!! I will make this again and again!! :o)
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#this is so easy and taste awesome!!! not too sweet
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I have made this 3 times since finding the recipe a little before thanksgiving. For the time invested it is delicious! Tastes like you spent forever in it. Yummy.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Very easy recipe. The taste was excellent. Made it for friends and they loved it! I didn't use a deep dish pie crust, I used a graham cracker pie crust because its my fav with cheesecake, and pecan pie. Because I didn't use a deep dish pie crust I used less caramel than the recipe called for, maybe 2/3 of it was used. My pie still came out like the pic and maybe even better! The one problem I did have with the recipe is the timing to leave the pie in the oven. The recipe stated 35mins. But my pie was still not done in the middle so I left it for an additional 15 mins. or so and it came out perfect with the golden brown crust. YUMMY!! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Quick, easy, delicious ... puzzling how the caramel/egg mixture sinks to the bottom during the baking. It was the hit of my 2012 Thanksgiving feast.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Do you think I can make this with a spring form pan? I dont have a pie dish...?
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Everyone in my family absolutely loves this pie, and they request it every year. The first time I made it I used the wrong kind of caramel, so the layers didn't work, but it was still good. Just make sure to double check your caramel before using it. Super tasty! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#SO DELICIOUS! I used a frozen deep dish pie shell and baked it on a cookie sheet. Came out PERFECT.~ Theresa
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#It looked just like the picture, and tasted just as good This one is a keeper!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#absolutely delicious.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Oops didn't realize I'd already rated this. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is soo quick & easy my 8yr old can make it. Took it to a family gathering everyone raved about it and I had to share the recipe!!!!! Will NEVER make a traditional pecan pie again!!!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Absolutely the easiest desert to make, my 8yr old could do it, also so delicious that I will NEVER make the standard pecan pie again. Took it to a fall hayride and everyone wanted the recipe!!!! SOOO glad I tried this one:)
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is East to make and the taste is DEVINE!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This pie is extremely tasty, but a bit too sweet for me. My family loved it. My only complaint was that it was a bit watery. Maybe it's just me. :) 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#My pie did not turn out as expected, was very disappointed. I've gone over the recipe many times as I was sure it was something I did wrong, but I just can't figure out what it was. I made 2 of these pies for Christmas and had to throw them both away. I read the reviews and the caramel sauce is supposed to sink to the bottom, but how does sauce with 3 eggs in it sink? It turned out like terrible caramel scrambled eggs on top. I've baked before and really can't figure out how everyone else can make it come out right, but mine was so terrible we couldn't eat it! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Zowie, this is one amazing combo pie. Delightful.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I used a deep dish frozen pie shell and baked it for 45 minutes, it came out perfect. Everyone loved it! Note: For my first try I used a regular sized pie shell and only 2/3 of the topping would fit, but it still came out great with compliments.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Excellant tasting and easy recipe! One of those where you don't realize how wonderful it is until the last bite. I did have tp add an extra 10 minutes to get the middle done. Absolutely beautiful to look at! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Rave Reviews for this pie!! Sooo Good!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is very delicious...we all loved it made for Thanksgiving..and planning to make again Christmas..If you like Pecan Pie and Cheescake.. this is both all wrapped up together...try it!!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Made for Thankgiving this year...my boys loved it! Will make every Thanksgiving along with the sratch pumpkin pie!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Easy to make, yet looks like you spent hours slaving in the kitchen. Rich tasting, yet not too sweet.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Five stars are not enough for this one! Made it with the ice cream topping but I'm wondering if it would also work with the caramel apple dip I always seem to have onhand. Has anyone tried substituting that? 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is a great recipe! I made it for Thanksgiving this year, and it was a hit with the extended family. It looks like a pecan pie until you cut into it. It tastes terrific! We gave a pie to our neighbor, and she requested the recipe so that she could make it for her family, too.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Wonderful recipe! I made this for my Thanksgiving dinner and it turned out fabulous. I used a graham crust rather than a regular pie crust, as my family prefers it! It was a nice change from makng the traditional pecan pie!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Delicious! Easy!!!! I am going to try a Pet Ritz pie shell this next time. I did cook the pie a little longer then suggested, as I wasn't sure how the center of the pie should be before taking it out. Any suggestions???? 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#To Coloradolime---I would certainly think you could do this in a 9x13 pan. I make my pumpkin pie recipe and bake in a pyrex cake pan. It comes out beautifully and is actually more healthy without the crust.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This was such an easy recipe to make, almost foolproof! And makes such a beautiful presentation when cut. People came back for seconds, and my pie was gone in a flash, no leftovers. The cheesecake layer rises to the top, the caramel sinks to the bottom, and the pecans float to the top just like the picture. I topped with extra caramel, I used Hershey's caramel syrup, and my pie was not runny at all, just like the picture! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Followed instructions, running in the middle and from a pie lover was one of the worst I ever made.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This was so yummy! Everyone raved about it and had to have recipe.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This looked so good but turned out runny in the middle even though I baked until golden brown per the recipe. Did anyone else have this problem?
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#My pie didn't set up..followed instructions to a tee....but we ate it with a spoon..great flavor! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is one of the best pies I've made and always am asked for the recipe 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Everyone enjoyed the flavor of this pie. Next time I will make my own crust.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I made this for Thanksgiving and not only was it easy to make it was so good! It was nice to serve something traditional with a twist.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Made this today...taste really good! Reminds me of the Pecan Pie except not as sweet! Will be repeating for Christmas!!!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#this was part of our Thanksgiving last yr. (2010)-and it definately will be included again this year.added 3oz more Phila Neuchatel (LO-FAT), and used 1/2 cup eggbeaters and 2 eggs (instead of 4 eggs) . It was delic. and more healthy. and it was super easy to make!(made it Tues nite for Thanksgivingday - it sat in refrig to enhance the flavors!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Has anyone ever tried making this recipe in a large baking dish and cutting into bars? I've got a crowd to feed and think that might be a better way to serve it. Wondering if it would hold up the same way. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#If you like Pecans, Caramel, and Cream Cheese you'll love this....it's sure to be a hit!! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#How easy to make and so delicious! My sister loved it and now wants me to make it instead of the traditional cheesecake I make.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This pie is super simple to make and it is a definite crowd pleaser! I have made it for Thanksgiving 2 years in a row and it will be a tradition from now on!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This pie s fantastic! I made it last night for dinner with my neighbors. It was a hit! This pie is simple to throw together. I used Smuckers special recipe butterscotch/caramel.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is one of the easiest and best tasting cheesecake pies I have ever made or had. I made it for first time for a family dinner and two whole pies got eaten!!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#No, cose i love to eat it,and i can't eat!! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#The recipe is correct as written. During baking, the caramel sinks to the bottom and the pecans rise to the top.Taste of Home Test Kitchen
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I'm confused, it looks like there are three layers to this pie? But the recipe says cheesecake is poured into the pie crust 1st, then the pecans and caramel ??? 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is a Great recipe and easy!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Made two of these for a get-together and everyone loved them.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Very good!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#My favorite pie to make and everyone love it!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Easy to make cheesecake that everyone loves!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This pie was to die for.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Every time I've made this recipe for family dinners, there is NEVER a piece left! I've started making two so my husband and I will have some...is even better days after being made! And it is sooooo easy to make! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Made this twice already, my boyfriend and I love it!!! Had slight issue with caramel topping and having to cook it a bit longer but it was terrific!!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Did it by the book It was perfect! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is one I will have to try.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I have made this pie for every family gathering, church dinners and for special events. It is the easiest and best of all desserts! It is always the first pie plate emptied at pot-luck dinners and guests marvel at it's appearance and taste! Everyone will think you spend hours preparing it!!! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Doesn't the recipe say to put the yellow filling in first? The picture shows the caramel filling having been put in first.Kate 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I definitely will make this recipe again. It is a delicious pie, wonderful taste and texture. I have prepared and carried the pie to several gatherings. Was enjoyed by all an there were no leftovers. After reading several of the ratings, the problem may be the baking temperature used was not as printed as well as the proper chilling time. My pies always look like the pictureyou show.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I've made this several times but have to add much more baking time to get the center cream cheese set. Also, I had to use a deep dish pie crust and still had caramel mixture left over.But everyone loves it so I will keep making adjustments. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#If I could give this 7 stars I would. I love it and my friends love it even more. Great rave reviews from all that have had it.For the one that said that the texture was like scrambled eggs, maybe the eggs weren't beaten long enough. I use an immersion blender on it and it is smooth as silk.This will be a year round go to recipe church luncheons and at work too. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Has anyone made this pi ahead of time and frozen it? I would like to make it for Christmas and freeze it.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Very easy directions and a simple pie but the pie was a little too eggy for me. It wasn't very appealing when I sliced it, the pie looked more like scrambled egg than a cheesecake mixture. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I made this for a luncheon for my friends for their Birthday.Everyone requested the recipe before they left. Rave Reviews. They could not beleive how decadent it was, in their own words. A BIG HIT. I RECCOMEND EVERYONE TRY THIS. FOLLOW THE RECIPE EXACTLY, ESPECIALLY THE LOW FAT CARMEL SAUCE. AMAZING
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is a good recipe, would absolutely make it again. I only see a very thin layer of the caramel. Must not used enough.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#turned out great...great alternative to traditional holiday pies!!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This was very bland and didn't have enought cream cheese, would not make it again 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I have made this receipe 3 times so far. It is so easy to make and taste amazing!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#After one bite, family members were raving Awesome! and Wonderful! and Delicious ! The only negative thing I can say is that I only made one pie, instead of two, to take to Thanksgiving dinner. Next time I'll know. ;) A huge thanks to whoever created this recipe - it's now added to our ever-growing must-haves for family gatherings. Super simple - simply delicious! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I used a premade frozen deep dish pie crust. Then I followed the recipe exactly. It was perfect. Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I used Mrs. Richardson's butterscotch caramel topping (full-fat) and it was fabulous. It was a definite favorite over the pumpkin and sweet potato pies. I also used low-fat cream cheese which worked very well. Happy Thanksgiving! 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was marvelous. Very simple and delicious. I was afraid it would be too sweet, but it had a perfect balance of flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, baked it the night before, and refrigerated it overnight. It came out just like the picture. I am a high school teacher and every year our guidance department has an evening event to help encourage students to pursue post-secondary educational opportunities. We all bake pies for the students and parents to enjoy. I always have difficult time deciding what to make, but this year it will be easy. This pie is great and I am sure it will be a hit.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I have only been able to find the regular caramel topping, not the fat-free. Does anyone know if it will still work or should I keep looking?
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is an excellent pie! I made two, one for my family and one to share and everyone loved it!! I plan to make one for Thanksgiving too!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Pretty darn good--making more now as I type!! Very good and extremely easy to make!! If it's not easy and good, I don't make it twice. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#made this for my birthday very good would make again I made my own crust of butter and flour excellent
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I loved the ease in which this dessert came together. I made one for my neighbor and one to share with my teaching colleagues. They loved it. I expect it to be on a few of their Thanksgiving menus. I also made the double-pastry pie crust recipe from the website for this recipe.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I made EXACTLY as recipe written. NO substititions! Smuckers in a JAR not a bottle. The dark layer is the caramel, it separates from egg mix and goes to bottom. It was Deeelicious!And a deep dish IS advized.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Tried it, it was delicious, will make again.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Excellent!!! Super easy and delicious. My husband loved this recipe. I will definitely make this again!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I would love to make this recipe, and I have some questions before I do. Since I'm diabetic and am appointed to make diabetic desserts for family gatherings, has anyone tried using Splenda for the sugar? And does Smucker's come out with a fat-free, sugar-free caramel sauce? I've seencaramel sauce in squeezable bottles, but don't know if Smucker's makes one in a jar. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I made this pie for our family reunion last week. It went like crazy! My sons girlfriend asked me to make one just for her the minute we got home. I have had so many requests for this recipe since then. This pie will definitely be on the Thanksgiving menu!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Mine didn't turn out like the picture. I used Smuckers Low Fat Caramel Sundae Topping... the only thing that I can think of is that the topping I used came in a squeeze bottle and not in a glass jar? Either way, tasted AMAZING! Only thing I didn't like, is that I couldn't eat a whole slice... it was too sweet for me. But, on the other hand, I rarely eat sweets, so maybe it is just because I'm not used to all that sugar. Either way, next time I will make it with caramel in a jar, instead of the squeeze bottle. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This recipe is a keeper. Everyone that tried it said I could make this for every get-together we have! I have used the lower fat cream cheese and it was just as good!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#It is super easy and so good! At first I was nervous too because of the layers, but after refrigeration it is perfect!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This recipe was good thought I would try this because of the caramel but it remind me of a pie I make which is a cream cheese pecan pie. The recipe was easy to follow, I would make it again.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#would give this 10 stars if I could. have made this 2 times and both were gone ASAP. I to was wondering about the layers, but decided to go with it, sure glad I did. just followed directions. looked just like the photo. it's definitely a keeper . well worth all the calories. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#1#Very yummy. I made this recipe from the cookbook and didn't see these reviews online until after making it. So, I used the squeezable container of Smuckers Sundae Topping (cookbook recipe doesn't specify the topping in a jar). Turned out with a gooey caramel layer under the pecans, on top of the cheesecake, instead of at the bottom like the picture shows, and like they say will happen if you use the correct product. It was still yummy! I'm only giving it four stars though because I wasn't blown away and because of the confusion. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is by far the best and easiest pie to make my whole family loves it,try freezing it for an hour and it is better as a frozen desert.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is excellent for the past two X-Mas it is requested
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#My husband loves Pecan pie, Cheese cake and Caramel so this receipe had everything in it. I followed the directions and it came out perfect. Just like the picture with 3 layers.I made it for our 48th anniversary. He couldn t wait the 4 hours for cooling and ate it after 3. It was still perfect. I will make it again. I think it was better than 5 stars.Sandy 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I have made this pie two times now and both times it is a HUGE success!! There are no leftovers and everyone raves about the taste. For such a quick and simple recipe there is an awful lot of praise! This recipe is a definite keeper!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#This is soooo easy! I make one apiece for all my brothers, for the Holidays, they love it!!
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#1#0#My son has to live on a gluten free diet so I leave the crust off,so he can eat it
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#We've received some inquires about the darker layer above the crust and if an ingredient was missing from the recipe. The recipe is correct as published. The darker layer is the caramel. If the correct caramel product is used, it will sink to the bottom during baking.Taste of Home Test Kitchen 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I liked this pie but I could not figure out what is between the crust and cream cheese. It is not in the recipe. I rate it a 5 star
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#It was delicious
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#it worked fine for me, I used half very thick caramel topping and half caramel sundae syrup because that's what I had and it worked fine, I baked mine for 35 minutes, then turned off the oven for about 10 more minutes, my oven runs hot compared to these recipes, but sometimes things aren't done in the middle, so this is my compromise. I wasn't sure what you meant by topping either, sounds like a cheaper brand of topping and not syrup will have the caramel sink to the bottom. I kind of have an issue with TOH in general, in that this takes way more than 30 minutes to make. In general, your recipes, all the ingredients are prepared - pecans chopped, cream cheese softened and then you start the timer, I wish you would put your times in as if starting from scratch. Like recipes that call for chicken to be cooked, that takes 25 minutes to do. I add the time before printing for my recipe cards. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Since many comments have been posted about this pie, the Test Kitchen determined we needed to retest it again for clarification. It worked just fine for us, however, two things are important. 1) Use a regular 9-in. pie plate (not a foil pan, as they are smaller). 2) Use the Smuckers fat-free caramel topping. Other Smuckers products or other brands may not produce the same results.Taste of Home Test Kitchen
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0# do you still have this recipe?   it cannot be found on the website any more thanks!jen 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I read all the reviews and wondered the same thing about the picture vs directions - didn't make sense. I made this for Father's Day and it looked like the picture and it was SOOO good. I don't know what others did wrong. I baked it longer than noted and I used reduced fat cream cheese. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Pie was a total diaster, the carmel ran all over the pie in the oven etc.... yes you need a deep dish pie crust.... question regarding the nuts is it only 1/4 cups or 1 and a quarter?
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#But how do you get the pie to look like the picture?  The'caramel' does not sink to the bottom.  Should part of it be poured into the crust first?  Taste great but sure didn't turn out like the picture.  It needs an extra deep pan also.  Bev in SW Ohio 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Yes, use the thinner brand of topping for this cheesecake. After publishing the recipe we have found that the viscosity of the topping will make a big difference.STAZ
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I made two of these this past weekend and everyone loved them. I used Smucker's Caramel Topping in the 12-oz. jar, not the Sundae Syrup in the pourable bottle. The 12-oz. jar is approximately one cup of caramel. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Does this recipe need a deep dish pie crust? I had enough filling left over to make another pie. I used Smuckers Caramel flavored Sundae Syrup which is used for ice cream. It was very thin. Is this the wrong kind of topping? What kind should I use? I think my pie is going to come out soupy also like the other reviewer's did. Thank for your help. Dragonlady. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Re: Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake PieThis recipe was easy to make. The combination of flavors was wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.Wendy
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I've tried this recipe twice and the caramel topping doesn't not harden and my pie comes out soupy. Could someone please help? If you know what I am doing wrong please email me and let me know. I would greatly appreciate it. avery.paula@yahoo.com 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Wow!!!! This is an awesome pie! I made it for a church pie contest and won FIRST! Everyone thought it was amazing and would never believe that it was so quick and easy. Thanks for an awesome recipe! This is definitely a keeper.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#Picture shows a brown layer between crust and cream cheese - not in recipe. Make pie, cooked for 40 mins, cooled, refrigerated over night - still mushy in center. Baked for an additional 30 mins, cooled, refrigerated overnight - better but not right.
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I'm guessing the caramel sinks creating the 3-layer look. 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0# Thanks for this recipe. It does look quick and easy. But are my eyes playing tricks or are there three layers to the cake in the picture? LOL       Miss Patty 
Caramel-Pecan Cheesecake Pie#0#0#I have made this pie a few times and my family loves it, even my grandma who never likes anything I make! I love pecan pie but think that it is just too rich. This is the perfect compromise, though I probably consume more calories this way but it is well worth it! Thanks for sharing it! Crystal 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#2#21#you lost me at the flour tortillas! those are burritos, not enchiladas. enchiladas are only made with corn tortillas. what you have there is a bunch of goop. but it does look tastey.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#5#14#Although I love both garlic and Mexican food, I thought this was terrible. The tortillas were soggy and the sauce was awful.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#3#1#I'm not a great cook and this was easy, fun and delicious. I could have drank the sauce with a straw! I took it to work and let people sample it and ended up giving the recipe out multiple times 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#8#0#I have been making this recipe since I first made it in 1999. I love the sage in it. I feel it sets it apart. If you are worried about the salt use a salt free broth- Walmart sells one. I alternate corn and flour tortillas - every other one. I feel if they are all corn they are too mushy and all flour to gummy. Every other is just right. This is hands down a recipe that people ask me for over and over again.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#8#14#I guess flour tortillas are okay but Mexican enchiladas are made with corn tortillas and they are also healthier.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#3#0#We loved this recipe! We love enchiladas and this is one of my favorite recipes so far. The sauce was smooth and creamy but I did add a little more of the seasonings. I also added a chopped chipotle pepper to the sauce and a tablespoon of adobo sauce to the meat mixture because we like spicy foods. Overall an excellent recipe! I'll definitely be making it again. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#1#1#Made for our family of 4, two kids and two adults. We are garlic lovers, so this recipe stood out to me. Everyone ate it, although nobody was rushing to get a second helping. I thought the sauce was tasty and the dish overall was a solid recipe. That said, for the time it took to put together, I didnt think it was really worth it. (I made on a weeknight and dinner was served later than usual for the time it took to compose.) I likely wouldnt make again.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#3#1#Very tasty, but too much salt. I reduced the amount, but next time will add no additional salt. I really liked the flavor of the sauce and look forward to having again. I topped with black olives and chopped jalapenos.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#2#0#Very good. Hubby liked it a lot. I agree that adding rice or beans to the meat would be a good option. I used half the amount of salt and the minimum amount of chili powder as per other's ratings. Depends on how hot you want it. Some said it was mushy so I didn't cook it as long. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#The dish was pretty good. I added some leftover rice I found in the fridge as a filler and it was nice. Next time I'd add corn and black beans to the filling. A few notes- I wasn't too crazy about the sauce, found it to be quite bland and needing to triple the seasoning. It was also way too thick and clumpy. I ended up adding water to thin it out. I also added a bit of brown sugar to cut the salt and acidity. Next time I would half the amount of salt. On its own it was WAY too salty. Thankfully the toppings masked the saltiness. This also makes a huge batch of sauce. I have enough to last me 3 more occasions. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#2#0#I don't give 5 stars very often. But my husband and I really did like this a lot. My teenage boys thought it was fine but they don't like Mexican food that much. I used bonafide organic bone broth that you buy in the freezer section. Traditional beef and chicken broth that you buy on the shelf is not good for you at all and has WAY too much salt. I also didn't add the salt in the recipe as other reviewers suggested. The salt flavor was perfect. My husband also bought the HUGE tortillas so I still had to cut them off because it was too much tortilla. I used 7 tortillas but they I cut about 1/3 off of them. I put in a little over 1/2 cup meat in each of them and also used a lot more cheese in the recipe and on top. We loved the jalapeños and red onion on the top. I wish I put avocado on top too. The flavor was great. There was a ton of sauce and we love sauce. Great meal. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#1#0#These were delicious. The sauce was creamy and smooth. They are a bit time consuming - I definitely wouldn't make them on a work day, We had friends coming over and they were perfect for entertaining. I had the enchiladas put together, and when our guests arrived I just popped them in the oven. They got rave reviews from everyone. I served them with chips and salsa and a southwest salad. Yum! 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#2#1#I was eager to try this from the great reviews, but did not care for this at all, the major seasonings are chili powder and cumin which give the Enchilada sauce on the top an odd flavor and sauce is very thick. This ended up being just a pile of mush when you take it out of the oven and not Enchilada flavor at all.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#2#My mom has been making these for years. They're a little spicy for me (because my heat tolerance is slim to none), but I still love them (I cut the spice with a bit of sour cream on top). They're very filling, so we usually only eat a half of one enchilada and then serve with some rice or chips and salsa. They feed a crowd that way! 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#It's so good, but even better with home canned broth (less salt) and homegrown tomatoes stewed and canned. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#A little salty for me but hubby really liked it.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#1#2#Intend to make this soon as my family and I enjoy Mexican food immensely. Thanks to the sodium police for pointing out the over-the-top sodium content of 2 enchiladas. I will modify the ingredients to reduce sodium when I make them.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#4#This recipe looks delicious, however, enchiladas are not made with flour tortillas. They are made with corn tortillas here in Colorado. To me, flour tortillas just turn to mush if baked in a sauce. But the recipe looks very good. will try it with corn tortillas, fried or heated in oil first.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#A family favorite!!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#1#0#I've been making these ever since the recipe was published and my friends and family love it. I triple the recipe and use ground round or ground chuck instead of hamburger. I freeze 1 1/2 - 2 cups of sauce in a freezer bag and 2 1/2 cups meat in another freezer bag. Tripling the recipe makes enough for 4 - 5 meals. I use this recipe when a friend or family member is sick and needs a meal. Everyone asks for the recipe. The only change I've a made is an omission: I don't add salt because there's already salt in the broth and tomatoes. I also lean towards the lesser amount of chili powder because I have two daughters who don't like spicy food. I love this recipe because it doesn't have any beans, making it very kid-friendly!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#3#0#I've been making this since it very first appeared in Taste of Home back in 1999. I've memorized the recipe. All my children (9) have grown up on this and it has become a main staple in our home over the years. I love it because it comes from scratch and doesn't use a canned enchilada sauce. Everything is absolutely the freshest it can be. Whoever made up the recipe, thank you so much. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#4#2#These were really good.I don't have much experience with cooking Mexican food but I work with several Hispanic ladies and they said I would probably like using white corn tortillas.Ivwill definitely be making these again.As for the sodium police we can all read the nutritional values for ourselves and decide to cookor not cook so myob
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#1#0#I have been making these for years. We live out of the USA and store-bought sauce is not available. I was glad for the sauce recipe. The people in the country I live love garlic. To them the more garlic the better the taste in any main dish. I reduce the amount of flour to the consistency that I like. As for the taco mix and taco itself, I make my own soft tacos from a recipe as that is the best we can do here. My soft taco is rolled very thin and pan-fried before I fill them. Thank you for the recipe. It has been a family favorite for years.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#9#Although I am sure that some people would like this,it is not traditional in any sense of the word. It is fusion cooking. This is Tex-Mex cuisine which obviously has been tweaked from traditional Mexican food made to please those North of the border. Here, in Texas, people put beef in just about everything. We always use cheese in our rellenos and enchiladas.Traditional enchiladas are made with corn tortillas as the author noted.The sauce recipe here is very much the same as canned sauce in that both use tomato products. I can tell you with authority that most restaurants and Mexican homes such as ours never use tomato products in our enchilada sauce. California, Northern and Central Mexico don't use tomatoes in this way traditionally.As we live in Texas, I encounter all sorts of deviations from traditional Mexican food. Some are o.k. but hubby will not eat enchiladas anywhere but at home due to the fact he is always disappointed in their preparation. The same is true with many Mexican families here.For my enchilada sauce I only use diced onion cooked in oil until transparent, then I add the flour and spices to create a roux and cook for at least 4 minutes. I then add the broth (Better Than Bouillon Chicken) and simmer for 30 minutes. I don't add salt as there is enough in the broth. My spice mixture is secret and handed down so I will not offer it here. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#1#that alright if you like gummy enchiladas.......I've been making enchiladas and never use flour. Mexicans never use flour eather. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#6#WAY too much sodium. You should take in less than 2,300 mg a day--not in one meal.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Pretty good recipe. The only thing, is there was too much flour, too thick; needs more sauce, and the tortillas were a little soggy. I would subtract some flour, add more tomato sauce and cook the tortillas a little before preparing them.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#I prefer homemade enchilada sauce to store-bought, so I knew I wanted to try this! I felt the sauce was lacking a teensy bit, and the amount of flour used seems strange, but it all came together nicely! I think I might try to add more of the chili powder to the sauce next time though. I had enough filling to make 2-3 more enchiladas too!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#1#0#I was very excited to try this recipe based on all the great reviews. I liked the simplicity of the recipe and the beef filling for the enchiladas was pretty tasty. However, I was not a huge fan of the enchilada sauce. I have made other from-scratch enchilada sauces I've liked better - I think this one called for too much flour for my taste - it got pretty thick, almost the texture of canned tomato soup before you add water to it. The overall taste was good though - we even ate leftovers the next day, but this is most likely not a recipe I'll save to make again. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Sounds good, to prevent soggy flour todtillas, cook them on both sides before rolling.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Delicious! I didn't know homemade enchiladas sauce was so easy to make . I'll never use the canned one again, if I can help it. I used 1/3 cup of flour instead of 1/2 cup for the sauce. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#These taste great, but my husband said that he would prefer the corn tortilla over the flour as he found them too soggy.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#1#Great recipe! I used 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef, and added in 1 can of Rotel diced tomatoes with chilies and 1/2 package of taco seasoning to give it a little more kick. I was short on time, so instead of making the home-made sauce, I used 1 large can of red enchilada sauce.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#This was a fantastic recipe. I used ground turkey, but otherwise followed the recipe. I love that it doesn't use canned enchilada sauce! 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#I fixed these for a Mexican themed meal and they received rave reviews. They're my son's favorite enchiladas. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#My husband and I thought these enchiladas were amazing! This was my first time making the sauce from scratch, it was easy and great tasting. We are garlic lovers and the garlic shines in this dish not over powering but it has the spotlight next to the sauce. Only thing i changed is the meat. My husband does not like ground beef so i used ground lamb. It's much more tender and with the spices you cant taste the lamb witch is good for me. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#I made these enchiladas for my husband and sons and they really enjoyed them. I added 1/2 cup chopped Jalapenos from my garden to the beef mixture, since my husband loves hot peppers. This recipe was a big hit!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#This is my first enchiladas that I made and I'm glad its came out great., even I misread the last two directions (I didn't put cheese in the tortilla and I put all the cheese on the tortillas before the first bake). My husband was raving it and he even brought the leftovers for work. I lessened the amount of flour as what the other reviewers said. I also lessened the amount of chili because my husband is not fan of spicy and for my 2 year old son. This is a keeper and next time I'll read the directions very carefully. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#1#0#I made this for 3 adults and 7 children under age 9. I made it because I love garlic and then started to worry as I tasted the sauce that the kick would be too much for all the young kids. I was so wrong! The kids couldn't get enough of it. I made 1 and 1/2 batches and it made 14 very full enchiladas. There were 2 left for today's lunch and it tasted even better as leftovers. For the sauce I lessened the flour slightly (by 2T for 1 1/2 batches) and it was still a little too thick for me. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Everyone was begging for this meal again soon as they were eating it last night. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#This is a great recipe as is, and easy to modify to suit your needs. I make this gluten-free with corn starch instead of flour, I use a can of Ro-Tel in the meat instead of stewed tomatoes, and white corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas. I have made this again and again, my whole family loves it!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#I add 1 diced chipotle chile + tbsp chipotle sauce while cooking beef for flavor. Delicious!!!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#1#0#My family liked this dish. I might add less flour to the sauce next time. Seemed very mild to me in flavor. But, the dish went together well and froze well. A keeper.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#This has been my go-to enchilada recipe ever since I found it in TOH many years ago! My whole family loves them.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#2#0#Very Very Good-- it was my first attempt and I had to substitute a few ingredients based on what was available and it still turned out amazing. I upped the ingredients I really like-- Onion, cheese, had to make due when I couldn't figure out where the hell my chili powder went and why I have so much Chinese 5 spice powder. No I didn't add chinese 5 spice powder to the enchiladas. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#This is a great recipe for enchiladas. The flour tortillas are good but we still use corn ones. The sauce is great and garlicy. You can lower the sage according to your taste, we like more cumin and less sage but the recipe is delicious any way you make it. You can add cilantro and onion to the beef before you wrap em. So so good!!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#1#0#I've been making this for 15 years, ever since I found it in my 1999 Taste of Home cookbook. Over the years I've tweaked a bit, for example, we love garlic so I use fresh garlic in the sauce as well as the meat mixture. I use Rotel milder tomatoes instead of plain stewed tomatoes. Sometimes I add rice to the meat...I've even added sweet corn & black beans a few times. I left out the sage for years, just because I never cooked with it. But I started to add it about 5 years ago & it does make a difference. All around a great recipe that's easy to modify for your own personal tastes. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#We really enjoy these! We've made with chicken as well as beef. We have also made a pan and frozen them to bake when we needed however we will also bake and then freeze in individual containers (vac pack) for individual frozen meals when we're in a hurry. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Good meal. Different than traditional enchiladas the garlic taste makes it more unique.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#1#I agree with some of the other reviewers. The extra 1/2 tsp of salt is not needed its already salty from the beef broth. Also I would use corn tortillas, like the texture better, not so soft like the flour. And I would omit the garlic... to me thats not really authentic Mexican, think I'll add jalapeno instead. also sauce did taste a bit floury.. Was good, but think I'll keep looking for a more authentic Mexican recipe. And was not bland at all!! I dont know where some of these ppl's taste buds are! 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Very easy and yummy!!!!!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Doubled this and it turned out great. Didnt add the salt as the canned tomato has enough in it for us.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Yummy!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#it was just ok
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#As good as everyone says. I put the minimum amount of seasoning it called for and it had tons of flavor. I will definitely make it again!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#great!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#This is my go to recipe for beef enchiladas. Great everytime.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Delicious! I also forgot the salt (and I am a salt addict), as well as the flour, and it came out wonderful! I, too, will not be buying the store brands of the enchilada sauce any more.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#This was a nice change from my other enchiladas and enchilada casserole recipes. The sauce was a little thick, and I could still taste the flour, which may be my fault, may have needed to let it cook a little longer. The were even better the next day for leftover lunches (and cold). I will make them again, but they will never replace my other enchiladas.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Wonderful company dish
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Absolutely excellent! Everyone- even my picky eater- loved it. My only complaint is that it was way too salty and I did not even add all the salt called for and I also used low sodium beef broth. So my suggestion is to completely omit the salt. I also think this would be great with shredded chicken or beef, and with other things added to the filling like rice, beans or pickled jalapenos. I had enough filling for 13 of the 6 inch tacos. I bet you could also use corn tortillas instead of flour if you wish. Over all this was amazing and I will definitely make it again! I bet this would freeze well (if you freeze it before cooking).
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Very tasty! However (and before any of you point it out, yes I saw the name of the recipe lol) I will say I will put in less garlic next time so that the other flavors can shine as well! Loved it and loved NOT using a canned sauce! Deff in our dinner rotations! :)
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Fantastic Sauce! I will never by store brand again! My family preferrs pulled beef or chicken as a swop for the ground beef. Added a few additional spices and a jalepeno to the mix. Even as is this is a keeper!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Absolutely love it! My family loved it! It was a hit! I followed everything step by step...delicious! Thank you for this recipe. Definitely a keeper.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Excellent! Very easy to make and really like the enchilada sauce. Our family does not care for the commercial brands of sauce that we have tried but this is good!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#1#0#This is a delicious dish. I do however agree that it is time consuming and makes a lot of dirty dishes. Working 12 hours a day, I think this will have to be a day off preparation. I followed the recipe as follows, using the spices that officer 1-2 tablespoons full @ 1.5 and it wasn't too salty or bland. Very good. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#This is one recipe that I will not make any changes to. I plan on making it today. My husband loved it.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#This were delicious!! The enchilada sauce was super easy to make and cheaper to make than it is to buy the sauce at the store. I will be making the sauce for my own enchiladas but using jalapenos for the heat instead of garlic. My family loves it spicy!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#I made this for my family. They did enjoy it. I however altered the recipe by adding garlic salt and garlic powder to taste. The sauce seemed to taste just like tomatoes to me, so it needed tweaking. I also don't buy beef broth, I made my own with beef base and water. Maybe that was the difference? Anyway, already had one request for this again! We love Mexican inspired dishes! 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Delicious and easy to make. I used ground sirloin for less fat, Mexican stewed tomatoes and also used low-fat Mexican blend cheese. Plenty of sauce too. Loved it!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Lots of sauce. We loved it.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#I loved all the garlic in the sauce. My family said that this was their favorite enchilada recipe, surprising because I rarely use ground beef in my Mexican food recipes. Listed sodium content is so high, I believe to be a typo. I still would use reduced sodium canned ingredients and not add the additional salt.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#We only made one small change to the recipe, we omitted the sage & added cayenne. It was amazing!! This is our new go to enchilada recipe!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#1#0#This was very good, but does take a bit of time and dishes to prepare. I used only 2 tbsp of butter, and less flour and broth. I added 1/3 cup queso fresco cheese and we like that a lot. I am thrilled to know how to make this great red sauce!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#This was very good, but does take a bit of time and dishes to prepare. I added 1/3 cup queso fresco cheese and we like that a lot. I am thrilled to know how to make a great red sauce!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#These were better than I expected. I had to make some changes because I didn't have everything once I started. I followed the recipe except I subbed chili powder for chili seasoning( from the packets), I used fresh tomatoes and a little bit of Pace salsa to equal the stewed tomatoes. I skipped the sage and used the upper portions of each seasoning and added a llittle cayenne pepper. Oh and I also had to used Cheddar cheese. I heated the tortillas beforeassembling too. It was so good! 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Excellent! I followed the recipe as given, but used the smaller amounts of seasonings when given a choice. Will definitely make this again.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#These were delicious.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#I think the tortillas I used were a tad bigger than recommended. They barely fit into my dish, but they sure were good and tasty.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Made this recipe as is, but we didn't care for it which was disappointing after all of the positive reviews. Will not make again. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Fun and easy recipe - great flavor
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Haven't made the Enchiladas yet (have it in my Cook'n file & can't wait to try it next week) but used the sauce in the Chimichangas I made last night. It added a great taste to them. The reviews about how good the sauce is are accurate. I typed the sauce recipe up separately & will be using it for Mexican cuisine! 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#1#Enchiladas made with flour tortillas?? Sacrilege!!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#These sound terrific but we do not like Sage. What spice could I use in place of it.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#These are absolutely delectable. I warmed the flour tortillas on a comal prior to filling them. Seemed to keep the tortillas from getting pasty. Very good!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#These are absolutely delectable. I warmed the flour tortillas on a comal prior to filling them. Seemed to keep the tortillas from getting pasty. Very good!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Loved by 4 boys and a Dad.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#I usually like to make green sauce enchiladas. After making this I dont know if ill ever beable to go back! These are by far the best beef enchiladas I have ever had! I love garlic so add more than the recipe calls for. Kudos!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Incredible - such a homemade taste! The spices were perfect, nice creamy tasty sauce and the amounts were great for our taste - enough sauce but not swimming in it. I did spread the sauce all over the top of the rolled tortillas once they were in the pan, as another reviewer said - and it really kept them from being too dry and crunchy. I made the whole recipe, then split it into two 9-inch glass dishes - two whole dinners for my husband and me!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Love these! I actually made 50% more last time to have some extra sauce and meat... and that's tonight's nachos! Thanks for the recipe! 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#O...M....G.....these are amazing! Most enchilada recipes I have call for store-bought enchilada sauce or a mix of other stuff that isn't very enchilada-y tasting. This sauce was fab. The beef is fab. Love love love. My family loved it. This is'company-good' for a casual meal. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#My kids really liked these!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#This recipe ROCKS!!!!! My family and friends love it! It is my go to recipe for something different in the weekly meal planning! been making it for years! Can't go wron making this one. The only thing I change is I delete the salt and you can't even tell it's missing. Great job and thank-you very much! 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#I've been looking for this recipe for 11 years!! It was a staple in my home and I lost my recipe folder in a move. Thank You, thank you!! 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#1#The enchiladas were good but I was expecting to be wowwed after reading all the reviews and I wasn't. Maybe it really makes a difference as to how much of the spices was used. I put in the minimum amount when it said 1 to 2 tsp or tablespoons . Maybe I should have put in the full amount. I have other enchiladas recipes I like better but I might make this again. We'll see how the leftovers taste tomorrow. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#VERY GOOD! Makes a lot, which I like. My husband and I love mexican flavors, and this tasted just as good as going out for enchiladas! Soo yummy!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#My entire family LOVES this recipe! Variations:1. Use cooked turkey or chicken instead of beef. (Great way to use up leftover Thanksgiving turkey.)2. Add a small layer of cannned refried beans to the tortilla before rolling up.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Absolutely delicious. Such good flavor and the sauce was the greatest. Nothing like that can enchilada sauce. The only thing I will do different next time is double the sauce and add an additional 8oz can of tomato sauce. Very, very good. Really the person who said these were bland have no taste buds. I substituted the stewed tomatoes for a can of Rotel like another reviewer did. Excellent!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#I never comment on recipes, but this was amazing! I only used 3 cloves of minced garlic in the sauce and next time I will use 2. This is just an awesome dish! There is no way that person who wrote it is bland followed the directions! It is anything but bland! wow! I love mexican food and this is so easy!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#The best enchilada I've ever eaten in my life! The meat mixture is soooo delicious, I use it to make nachos as well! By far a must have on any monthly menu plan! :D 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#These are awesome! The beef filling is my favorite, but the sauce is very yummy too. I happen to have fresh garlic from our farmer's market, and this recipe really lets it shine. My daughter can't wait for them to come out of the oven after sampling the filling! 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#I added Rotel to the meat to add a little heat. yummy!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Loved it! Very yummy, and easy to change to different tastes. So glad to now have a recipe that doesn't need canned enchilada sauce. We will be making this often, serves a crowd for very little cost! 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#We did not care for this recipe at all. We found it to bland.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#good to cook.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#good recipe to cook.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#absolutely delicious! If you like, use shredded cooked chicken in the filling (add after the onions are cooked in a little olive oil) instead of the beef. Substitute chicken broth for the beef broth.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Delicious! I didn't add any salt and used low sodium broth and they turned out great! For the sauce I used the 1 tsp of chilli powder, cumin and sage and still had enough kick for us. Will make again!! 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#It doesn't look anything like the picture, but it's EXCELLENT!! 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#we have been making this recipe for years and we love it! We prefer corn tortillas and double the sauce.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#I have made this recipe exclusively for years! Another thing I love about this recipe is that they freeze really well for those days when you don't have time to cook! 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#the homemade sauce is heavenly!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Just a tip for those feeling it tastes too salty. Add only a little salt in the beginning, you can always add more as you cook and taste. Can't wait to try this, thanks for the reviews. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#This is really tasty. My whole family enjoyed - even my kids. I used corn tortillas for myself to make it gluten-free. I found I had to dip/brush sauce on both sides to keep them from breaking. I left out the flour in the filling and used 1/4 cup cornstarch in place of the flour in the sauce to make it GF. I just added the cornstarch to the broth. I think this would taste good with beans, either in the filling or on the side. Next time I might try reducing the butter. Has anyone tried that?
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#The only change we will be making next time is to make more sauce! Delicious recipe though.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#LOVED this recipe! Great flavors and different from my regular enchiladas. It was a nice change! Making them again tonight for cinco de mayo!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#VERY VERY VERY good! Lots of flavor, enough spice to give it a kick but not overwhelming. will definately make it again. i did change one thing, used 1.5lbs beef cause 1lb didn't seem enough. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Having grown up on mexican food, we never used corn tortillas -- always flour. This was too salty and all the spices left us drinking a lot of water. Dredging the tortillas in the sauce before filling and rolling would make them look more authentic.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#This recipe is great!! Easy to make. Tastes as good as any Mexican restaurant. My son requests this at least once a week.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#If my family had their way I would make this more often. I make extra sauce with it. I have to double the recipe. Written down for many family membes too!!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#this was totally gross - all I could taste was salt and I love salt! Will go back to my original receipe - wanted to try something new and wish I hadn't 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#I love this recipe! The sauce is so good, who would ever buy sauce? I can't decide if I like it better with Flour tortillas or corn. Great standby recipe. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#These were great! Definitely my new go to beef enchilada recipe.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#This is one of my favorite recipes. Thank you for sharing!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Jennifer this recipe is outstanding. Hubby raves about it everytime I make it.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#I substituted a can of Rotel tomatoes for the tomato sauce with great results. It gave it a nice extra kick.
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#This is one of the best recipes I've ever tried, we use chicken for the filling. This sauce is the best 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#Excellent recipe for Mexican fare!
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#1#If i am lazy and don't want to make the meat sauce, I squish up my homemade chili (that i always keep a supply of in the freezer) and use it instead. And I agree with mattnat, I could practically drink the sauce! 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#This is well worth the time it takes in the kitchen. Every time I make it; the sauce is so delicious I end up scraping the pan and licking the spoon! The other night I made the meat filling from this recipe; put it in some store bought tostada bowls with some salad fixings. It was a big hit! My kids are not fans of enchiladas, so I save some tortillas when I make the enchiladas and make soft tacos for them. 
Garlic Beef Enchiladas#0#0#This dish is so delicious. I also use the meat recipe for tacos. This is a recipe that I will use over and over again. Thanks
Chunky Apple Cake#2#0#I got this recipe from my husbands grandmother and have made it for years. But I add raisins, nuts, and sweetened coconut flakes.
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#Wow, this was delicious! I accidentally put 3 eggs and I used about 4 cups apples, and it still came out perfect! I just drizzled the sauce over the whole cake while it was still warm. Definitely will make again!
Chunky Apple Cake#11#4#I must have used too many apples? I got dried up apple chunks instead of a cake. :( The recipe looks so good and you all have had success. What did I do wrong?
Chunky Apple Cake#0#1#Love this cake,, and everyone I make it for does too,,,
Chunky Apple Cake#2#0#Hello, I made this chunky Apple cake last family party. It was a huge hit, the cake, the sauce OMG was really really good. I'll keep making this for special events. Thank you so much. 
Chunky Apple Cake#2#1#I tried this recipe a few years ago and it is now a Fall tradition in our home. My family asks me to make it every October. The cinnamon flavor and chunks of apple make it delicious! I serve it with the yummy caramel sauce and homemade whipped cream. This sweet dessert gets 5 stars.
Chunky Apple Cake#16#1#First of all, I have been making this cake for years. It is an all time favorite of mine Next, there are a few speedboats you hit while making. For example, the batter is VERY thick. Honestly, it's more the consistency of cookie dough. Dont try to use a hand mixer on this, it will break (been there, done that). The reason for that, though, is all the liquid that is in the apples will cook out and mix with the batter while baking. It's supposed to be like that. Next, it is VERY sweet if you use anything other than a tart apple; I always go straight for the big granny smiths. Anything else just adds together to make a sugary overload. Last, the end result is a very moist, very heavy cake. Best if eaten quickly, even better if warm. It will not last more than a couple of days! Pairs beautifully with some vanilla ice-cream, cinnamon, and caramel (never actually used the butterscotch sauce part of the recipe, never felt it was the right kind of flavor). Makes for a fantastic breakfast or dessert, and it's perfect for those cool autumn nights and brisk winter mornings. 
Chunky Apple Cake#6#0#Loved loved loved it I'm so glad I only used ONE CUP of sugar instead of two as the apples provide a lot of sweetness as well. Turned out delicious! 
Chunky Apple Cake#12#10#I always make the recipe my own. I buttered the dish and dusted it with a cinnamon sugar mix. Cinnamon Sugar Mixture: 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon; whatever cinn sugar is leftover, I added to the cake batter mix I used 2 C unsweetened applesauce to substitute cut up apples. I used 1 tsp pure vanilla extract. Then I added 1/2 tsp.. ground cloves in addition to spices. It baked in 38 minutes using a Pyrex dish. I also made the butterscotch sauce. My family liked it. It could stand alone without sauce or frosting. lt is delicious 
Chunky Apple Cake#7#0#Made this last night and it was delicious! The standout for me was the sauce. If I made it again, I would definitely cut down on the sugar, but otherwise, it was perfect.
Chunky Apple Cake#9#0#Excellent cake. Since I don't like nutmeg I added extra cinnamon. Yum!! Constance, Please post the Apple Stuffed French Toast Thanks, Connie :+)) 
Chunky Apple Cake#4#0#Husband liked this cake; however, I thought it was too heavy and dense after the first day. Best eaten first day when very fresh.
Chunky Apple Cake#5#6#Every fall I make this cake usually with a mixture of different apples since I gather an assortment at the local farm, it has become a favorite amongst my family and friends, with or without the sauce or whipped creme. The Apple Contest Winners issue is one of my favorites, we also look forward to the Apple stuffed French toast
Chunky Apple Cake#20#5#I've made this a few times now and it's always a big hit. After reading the reviews, I chose to use 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar rather than 2 cups of white sugar. It's sweet enough and had an amazing texture. The last time I made it, I also tried slicing the apples rather than cutting them into chunks and my husband preferred it this way. This is such an easy and delicious recipe! Thanks! 
Chunky Apple Cake#23#4#This apple cake is good. I added walnuts and raisins as some suggested. I didn't make the Butterscotch sauce. I bought a bottle of caramel sauce for topping. If you're not eating the whole cake right away, the homemade sauce didn't seem like a good idea.
Chunky Apple Cake#4#7#Really great flavor and easy to make. I used a food processor for the apples, and cut the calories by using Egg Beaters, LF yogurt spread (Brummel & Brown) and monk fruit with a little Splenda to sweeten it (since I can't have a lot of sugar.) Served with with a cup of hot latte it's so comforting - especially on a chilly Fall afternoon! Next time I'll add raisins. Keeps well in the fridge. This is a keeper! 
Chunky Apple Cake#3#0#I already left my review, but wanted to say, I did find that I needed the full 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda for the half recipe, so I'm thinking a full teaspoon for the whole cake? At any rate, really awesome recipe!!! 
Chunky Apple Cake#6#2#You forgot the Walnuts. Chopped Walnuts make a huge difference.
Chunky Apple Cake#3#1#I have made this for years! It was called Apple Dapple Cake!
Chunky Apple Cake#8#2#When I put this recipe together the batter was extremely thick, and I could barely fold in the apples. I struggled to press it into the 9x13 pan. I thought for sure I would have to throw it out the next day and find another recipe for the birthday party. To my amazement it cooked perfectly and my family loved it. I will use this recipe without fear for any occasion.
Chunky Apple Cake#6#4#I use to make this all the time, my ex-mother-in-law taught it to me... but she always sliced (not diced) her apples and never used any topping other than an occasional sprinkling of powdered sugar. It was one of the few cakes that my step-dad (a type 2 diabetic) could eat once in a while. I've made this both ways and it's awesome either way but I think I lean more towards the no icing and sliced apples. 
Chunky Apple Cake#2#2#Delicious, this is my go to apple cake, everyone loves it,,with the sauce,,
Chunky Apple Cake#2#1#Made this for my husband's collector club. I didn't have the spices individually so I used apple pie spice. It worked well. I didn't have time to make the butterscotch sauce, but the cake itself was sweet enough. One of my husband's friends went back for seconds. 
Chunky Apple Cake#3#4#Epic failure. Don't know what we did wrong but it wasn't cake at all...more like apple crisp that wasn't crisp. sickening sweet 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#Love it! Perfect for the Fall!
Chunky Apple Cake#3#3#I just made this recipe, I was a bit hesitant when I read Scott's review, but I decided to try it. I had to cut it in half because there's just two of us and it turned out moist and tasty! I did reduce my bake time to 35min because I prepared a 9X9 pan. The dough is stiff as it mentions, I didn't have beaters, so I used a wooden spoon for stirring, turned out good with a little more effort. ??
Chunky Apple Cake#4#0#Scott-- What on earth did you do? I have made this cake AT LEAST 30 times since it was first published in 2006. It was delicious every single time. The batter is full of apples so the first time I made it I wasn't sure there would be enough batter to hold it together but there was! I am often asked to bring this cake to parties, get-togethers, school events, etc. I'm printing out a new copy of the recipe b/c mine is so smudged up from using so many times. 
Chunky Apple Cake#2#18#This was a huge disappointment. It does smell good so I am hoping that serving it hot with a scoop of ice cream may make it edible so it doesn't have to be dumped in the garbage, I don't have extra in food budget to be throwing away food. The stiffness of the batter? IS a cause for concern. I am going to try to save this mess and will never make it again. 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Absolutely delicious! I also used 1 cup of White sugar and 1 cup of Brown sugar. Added 1/4 tsp more of cinnamon. Doubled the Butterscotch sauce and cooked for 20 minutes or so for thicker consistency. I served it warm with the sauce and a scoop of French Vanilla Ice Cream. My son and his wife took half the cake home for their family and will be bringing me more apples to make this again.
Chunky Apple Cake#2#0#Delicious! I followed some of the suggestions and used 1 cup of white sugar and i/2 cup of brown sugar. Added 1 cup of raisins and just sprinkled with powdered sugar. Frosting or sauce is not needed!
Chunky Apple Cake#4#0#This is a great cake. Kinda had a panic moment when I found out there wasn't enough cinnamon in the pantry. So I put what cinnamon and nutmeg was back on the shelf and grabbed the Pumpkin Pie Spice. Threw in a scant Tblsp. Problem solved. There WILL be a next time making this cake so it'll be to try the original as written version.
Chunky Apple Cake#3#0#What this cake lacks in a lovely presentation it makes up for in flavor! It was moist
Chunky Apple Cake#2#1#Good flavor and texture. Followed recommendation to reduce sugar (I did 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar). Also nutmeg flavor seems a little strong (I would reduce and possibly increase cinnamon if necessary). Make sure you choose to use tart apples to get the best flavor.
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#The cake was moist and good and the sauce made it even better. I used 1 1/4 cups of sugar and that worked perfectly.
Chunky Apple Cake#3#1#I decreased the amount of sugar per previous reviewers recommendations to 1 1/4 cup sugar. I didn't spend the times and effort making the sauce, rather some caramel syrup and whipped cream instead. This cake doesn't really need any toppings as it is delicious by itself. 
Chunky Apple Cake#3#0#This is awesome cake...but I only use 3/4 cup of sugar....and that is still plenty sweet...especially with the sauce on top..... Most of the time I don't even use the sauce because the cake is delicious by itself and I only sprinkle confectioners sugar on top just before serving.... :) Easy and delicious! 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Great cake!! I did toss the apples in some butter and cinnamon sugar before adding them to the cake mix.
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#While the recipe is simple, the cake was very sweet. I would reduce the sugar to 1 1/4-1 1/2 cups.
Chunky Apple Cake#3#0#I took this cake to a party this past weekend and it disappeared in a heartbeat -- everyone wanted the recipe! It is moist and delicious and easy to make. I will definitely be baking this again soon!
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Phenomenal cake.
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups and left out cinnamon as I don't care for it. It turned out really well. Loved the butterscotch sauce which was wonderful with the whipped cream. Good compliments were received! 
Chunky Apple Cake#2#1#Really good. I had a dinner party and the person who was supposed to bring dessert couldn't make it. I didn't have everything the recipe called for. I used ingredients I had on hand to create this yummy cake. I only had 1 1/2 Braeburn apples left over from a fruit salad, so I used that and a cup of applesauce. I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown. I also only used a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of cloves. 2 teaspoons vanilla and 1/3 teaspoons baking power 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. I baked these into cupcakes at 350 for 25 minutes. I didn't make the topping but just dusted the tops with powdered sugar. The batter was kind of like cookie dough. These were mouse and delicious. Everyone really enjoyed these and said I should make again. 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Absolutely the perfect dessert- easy to make and delicious to eat! A definite keeper!
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#Easy, the sauce was the best, will uses sauce for other receipts.
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#I've made this recipe numerous times and always get raving reviews. Best apple cake recipe by far! 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#1#I love apple cake and have struggled to find one that I really like and would make again. This is it! It is also versatile. You can add a little less sugar, more or less of your spices, with or without a topping. It is really good with a scoop of ice cream! I found it was a decadent dessert with a praline sauce drizzled over it.
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#I found the recipe way too sweet. I will definitely repeat it but I'll do 1 1/4 cup of sugar instead, everything else was great. That would be my best advice. 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#2#This was a great apple cake. I had never made one before so when the batter was stiff I was at the concerned....but sure enough it turned out fabulous. I didn't bring any home from my dinner party. It was delicious with or without the sauce. 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#This is a fantastic recipe! I must have looked at 20 - 25 recipes before choosing this one. I wanted a recipe that used a lot of apples and used butter instead of oil. The reviews of most of the recipes said they cut the amount of oil and still made a too moist or oily cake. This is a moist cake, but not too moist. The batter is stiff until you add the apples. It easily spread into the pan. I wanted to taste more apple, so cut the nutmeg in half. It was perfect. You can still taste the nutmeg, but it's not overpowering. I bought caramel sauce instead of making the butterscotch sauce. The cake is great even without any sauce. My husband said this recipe was definitely a keeper! 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#I have made this recipe numerous times over the years and it is a decadent family favorite. Making again today!!
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#I pocked the cake all over and poured the caramel sauce over the cake right out of the oven. So good.
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#This is a really good cake! When I spread it into the pan it seemed like more apple than cake. Didn't look like it would ever make a cake. The juice from the apples mixed with the batter and made a nice moist apple pie cake. Everyone loved it! 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Best apple cake I have ever made!
Chunky Apple Cake#0#1#I followed this recipe exact , except I substituted Splenda for sugar. The recipe said the batter would be stiff and I could have rolled it out like pie crust. I added milk to make the batter that I could put in a cake pan and spread out. It had plenty of apples and the butterscotch sauce made it taste wonderful. Did not look good but tasted great. Will not make this again.
Chunky Apple Cake#3#0#This was fresh and delicious! Easy to make and love the spices. A keeper for sure! Thanks, Debi!
Chunky Apple Cake#1#2#Sounds good. I've never tried making this before I've given it a 3....but could it be made with pears instead?? I have some to use up in the fridge! Someone please let me know ASAP..?!? 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#the best apple cake ever!
Chunky Apple Cake#2#1#So very moist, turned out great! Followed the recipe to a T. It stayed very fresh on the counter for 3 days. I poured the sauce on each piece right before serving, to keep the cake from getting soggy. Simply delicious!
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#Easy and delicious, a great way to use some of the abundance of apples we have at this time of year. This came out picture perfect. I used half and half and the sauce was great. Really liked it.
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#Great for fall
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#A great apple cake that is nice and juicy! The Butterscotch sauce adds a delectable flavor to this wonderful fall cake! Don't worry if the batter looks quite thick - the juice from the apples helps it cook perfectly! 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Best apple cake ever! I remember when this won the apple contest.
Chunky Apple Cake#2#0#This was excellent. I tried stirring the apples in for a few seconds and then just used my hands. I will definitely make this again.
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Delicious! I used close to 5 cups of chopped apples and it still seemed like a lot. I used a caramel whiskey sauce because I already had some made up and a dollop of home made whipping cream and oh was it good! I will make the butterscotch sauce the next time. And as another person said the cake stands on its own. I myself loved the texture of the flaky crunch on top of the cake. My husband loves anything baked with apples in it and this one was a big hit!
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#I made this for my family and they loved it.
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Oh my, I knew this would be good when I read the ingredients. But, I had no idea that it would be so fabulous. It is so full of apples that make it incredibly moist. The sauce was the crowning glory. I served it with whipped cream, but, next time will pair it with vanilla bean ice cream. I can't wait to make it again! 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Using granny smith apples provided the right tartness level to balance out the sweetness of the sauce. We thought the recipe was perfect as is. I even had a guest sneak another helping right out of the pan in the kitchen.
Chunky Apple Cake#3#0#Delicious cake I too cut the sugar in half but added 3/4cup of walnuts with melted butter and brown sugar mixed together as a topping great with or without the sauce. I have made this three times in the last month with many compliments, thank you Debi for the recipe
Chunky Apple Cake#2#0#I made the cake as-is and it was perfect. I wouldn't change a thing, except that with my oven I needed about 10 minutes more baking time. Oh, and I used 4 different types of apples (Granny Smith, jazz, pink lady, and braeburn). As others have stated, the batter was indeed quite stiff, but my little Sunbeam mixer could still handle it. When it was time to stir in the apples, the fruit-to-batter ratio was very high; no wonder this cake is so incredibly moist! Speaking of which?don?t worry if the surface of your cake is hard and crusty when it comes out of the oven. After it?s mostly cooled, cover it with foil and it will resolve itself shortly to become uniformly moist and tender. As with most cakes, it's better the second day. I think the cake stands on its own without the sauce, but that punch of sweetness is a nice treat. I added a few drops of butter-rum extract, just for fun. I will make this sauce again for other things (ice cream, or a dip for apples, for example). Five stars! 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#I didnt put the sauce on because butterscotch flavour is my least favourite but the cake was very yummy without it! Bewared tho, I didnt use apples from the store and I mixed up my eating apples with the ones meant for cider- almost didnt turn out!
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#This cake is so good! I cut down on the sugar in the cake and sauce. My husband absolutely loved it and he preferred it without the sauce. I like it with the sauce. So its wonderful either way.
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#The texture was soggy, the taste was bland, the sauce only added more sweet to a really sweet cake and then throw in the fat and butter and there was nothing to find tasty.
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Very good! I took the advise of the other comments & only used 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. I also didn't make the sauce because I didn't have the cream. My family thought it was good just as it was. A keeper! 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Definitely a keeper apple recipe. I used Newtown Pippin apples...great chunky flavor! I, too, had to bake the cake an extra 5 minutes each time I've made it. The top doesn't spring back, so I look for a golden-brown top instead. The sauce is nice but not necessary. (I took the advice of another reviewer and used butterscotch topping instead.) This cake is fine served at any temperature. This cake is a contest winner for sure! 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#This desert was so good! Made it for Thanksgiving and it went over very well!! Will make again and again!
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Ok, I cheated.LOL, I couldn't help it. I used honeycrisp apples, cut the nutmeg in half, used 1/4 cup less sugar, added a spoon of molasses, added 1 cup raisins, added 1 cup apple cider...But anyway, it turned out great! 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#1#Wow is all I can say. Made it for a special family dinner and everyone loved it. I used Granny Smith apples and followed the recipe to a tee. My only adjustment was to bake it a little bit longer until done.
Chunky Apple Cake#0#1#Is vry delicious- even without the topping. I didn't have time to make the butterscotch topping, but served it with ice cream and hot caramel topping instead. It was fabulous. I also omitted the nutmeg since I'm not a fan of it. Still turned out great. Will keep this recipe on hand for a different fall, apple dessert. 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#I just made it for the second time tonight! It's amazing and the butterscotch sauce and fresh whipped cream are an amazing combination!! 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#This was very good! I didn't have all six cups of apples. I only had 2 granny Smith and 2 fugi, which gave me close to 5. It didn't matter because it was still full of apples and really delicious. The crust on top was crispy after baking so I wasn't able to test with the spring back like a regular cake recipe so just use a toothpick to test. It almost tastes like an apple crisp cake. I have to add the I didn't make the sauce and it was sweet enough without it. My boyfriend doesn't eat sweets and thinks its too sweet but I can't stop eating it. I gave some to my family and they loved it too. I will probably make it again. 
Chunky Apple Cake#2#0#This is the first time I've ever posted a recipe review. I had to cook this about 5 mins longer than suggested, but the result was - quite simply - The Best Cake I Have Ever Tasted. My friends, family, everyone agreed. Better after 1 day in the pan, covered with foil. It just got more and more moist as time went on. I didn't make the sauce - it's sweet enough it doesn't need it - though my little boy really liked it with cream poured over the top. (We live in London, they do that here...) Amazing! 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#I have made this often!! It's amazing! 
Chunky Apple Cake#2#0#I used FROZEN PEACHES!
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#I don't think I cooked it long enough. The cake tasted delicious, but I think it could of cooked a little longer. Have made it with and without sauce and either way it is a winner. 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#Followed recipe as given. Wasn't baked long enough, raw! Too much spice overpowered apple taste. Family said losethe recipe. 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#So yummy and easy to make! Everyone loved it!
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#Love making seasonal cakes for the family ... they loved it ! Will be a keeper.
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#My family loves this cake. I make it at least twice a year.
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#So good! My husband almost ate half of it in one sitting! loved the sauce. i didnt have the cream so I used half and half then put a couple tablespoons of flour in it to thicken it up.
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#I've been making this almost every year since is appeared in the TOH magazine. I remember how wowed we were at the first bite. I haven't met a person yet who didn't love this prize-winning chunky apple cake. It definitely is a fall-time favorite in this house! Mmmmmm good! And the sauce is so delish. :) 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#This is the second time making it, the first time was when it came out as the Grand Prize winner in 2006. I don't change a thing and it's perfect! The amount of sauce is perfect with the cake, any more would make it too sweet. And some have said that the amount of nutmeg was a bit much, but I didn't think so, it's a matter of taste. I served it with a side of Butter Pecan ice cream. Wonderful. 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#What a great recipe! I live in Washington State and I am always on the lookout for apple recipes.. It turned out great the first time I made it. Thanks for sharing!
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#This is amazing!! I put a little more apple in it, and use Empire apples with peel on some. I too use a little less nutmeg, and double the sauce. Everyone loves it!  I also use 1 cup br. sugar instead of 2 cups white.
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#This was delicious! My one piece of advice would be to make sure you cook it long enough!! For us the 45 minutes was not long enough. It tasted fine raw, but better when we cooked it long enough!! Thanks for the recipe!
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#I got this recipe long ago when it first appeared in the magazine. I made it many times for my family until the recipe got lost over a year ago. I am so happy to find it here again! The only thing I do differently is that I only use 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg so that the nutmeg does not overpower the cake. And the butterscotch sauce is delicious!
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#The only thing i would change on this recipe is a little less nutmeg. I tasted it too much. I also didnt use the sauce on top and it was absolutely delicious without it!
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Real good with vanilla ice cream!
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#It has become my new best birthday cake. Anyone that tastes it raves. It has a texture a little like bread pudding. It's great! 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Excellent Recipe! Very moist and delicious!
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#tried this recipe a the Assisted Living Facility I work for...it was awesome.... the residents loved it!......I had to double the recipe, but left the amount of apple the same as for one, I also shredded the apples...the caramel sauce made the desert!.....will definated make this one again
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#I made this the other day for my husband and it was fabulous! Very flavorful and moist. Didn't change a think on the recipe! I would make it again any day! Thanks for the recipe 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#I had never made apple cake before this. My family really enjoyed it. I made it in a lasagna pan because there were so many apples. I used 4 large granny smiths. The sauce was thin so I whisked in some powdered sugar to thicken it. I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was delicious!
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#This was so dry! I'd never make it again. 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#I have made this recipe many many times to rave reviews. I made a few changes like adding a streusel topping along with chopped walnut on top. The crumbly nutty top tastes very good with the sauce. =)
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Excellent (with no changes to the recipe). I will make this again and again!
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#Amazing taste and extremely moist! A huge hit at work :)
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Cake turned out very well, moist and good taste. I added nuts to the batter. There is an awful lot of sugar in this recipe. Have another recipe for apple cake that I like better. Would make again because my husband loved it.
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#I cut the nutmeg in half, but otherwise followed the directions. It was sooooo yummy!
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#i made this cake for a nursing home fall festival. it was a great hit. made it using sweet and tart apples, the batter was real thick, but it turned out to be the best cake ever. now i have apple trees in my new home, and plan on making it every year.
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#The sauce reheats in the microwave very well. I've toted this cake, the sauce in a covered microwaveable container, and a can of Redi Whip into the office on several occasions. Nuke the sauce, stirring a couple of times, just before you serve the cake. It helps if you use a small gravy ladle to pour the sauce over the cake. 
Chunky Apple Cake#2#0#I made this cake exactly as written. It was excellent. Great for pot lucks if you can keep the delicious sauce warm and top just as you serve it. I tried putting it on top and cutting later, but makes it very soggy if it sits too long. It is the best and yes the I wondered when I made the batter if it would cook up correctly as it didn't seem to have enough liquid. But as others have state, the apples have a lot of moisture and the cake turns out wonderful. This is a keeper and we will have at Thanksgiving time. 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#This is great. I've made it three times in 2 weeks. It's a huge hit! 
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#Made this tonight for the first time...OMG soooo good! Maybe less nutmeg next time.
Chunky Apple Cake#1#0#I will make it again and again. Everyone in the house loves it. If you run out or don't care for butterscotch, try a little whipping cream. OOOOh. yum. 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#After reading the reviews about the batter being stiff, I was a little concerned. The catch is that the moisture from the apples cooking puts the added moisture in. It is very moist and full of our favorite fall flavors, apples, cinnamon and nutmeg.
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#This is a great tasting cake. Will definitely make again. Only change will be to use about half the nutmeg. Thought the original amount a bit over powering.
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#Excellent taste
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#I used spice grinders for an explosion of fall flavor. What a moist, delicious cake! Like a candied apple but easier to eat. I like the nutmeg myself but did add extra vanilla.
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#This was to die for.Everyone loved it
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#This recipe was great - except I cut the Nutmeg way down to 1/8 teaspoon, used 1 tsp vanilla and used McIntosh Apples. Gets more like a bread pudding the longer it sits. The caramel sauce is fantastic and makes it!
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#This recipe sounds really good was just wondering if you could use canned apples? ThanksShyMee57
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#I have been making the pumpkin cake which is basically the same, but apples and applesauce instead of the pumpkin. I can't wait to try this one. The pumpkin cake was such a hit with my family. It is now the new birthday cake. 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#This looks delicioius. Can't wait to try it. I have a lot of family that visit and this will be a new dessert for me to try on them. Thanks.mbradway 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#Such a good cake! I'll be making it for my Farmer's Market booth this week. It'll be a hit! 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#This apple cake looks very good, however 365 calories for one piece? And 2 cups of sugar? Not good for my diet.
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#I've made a recipe similiar for years (only difference is 1/2 c. veg. oil instead of butter and 4 c.chopped apples and 1 c. chopped walnuts. I didn't have sauce, but will try it. You all should too, as it turns out great! (apples have alot of liquid, don't forget). This was my dad's favorite fall recipe. 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#Well how did it turn out with very little liquid called for in the recipe?
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#I have the same question... Isn't there a liquid needed in this recipe. I haven't made it but don't want to mix all of these nice ingredents up and have something not so good. Please let us know.Sue G 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#elliston - I haven't made this yet, (on the schedule for this afternoon), but frequently apple cakes have a very thick batter, because of the moisture the apples release when cooking. UPDATE: This is great! Moist, lots of apple flavor. Love the fact that it has so many apples, and the butterscotch sauce is perfect with it. 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#I tried to make this cake but the batter was like cookie mix. Was an ingredient left out, like milk or some other kind of liquid? I have a similar recipe that calls for milk. Any suggestions?
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#This was SO delicious! I used heavy cream because my hubby didn't realize it wasn't whipping cream, but it didn't make any difference. I definitely won't wait until the next holiday season to make this one! YUM!!! 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#Very GOOOOD cake,one I will make again.Loved the sauce Lisa
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#WVALLJ -I think that applesauce would be an ideal replacement but I have also used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Fat Free and have had excellent results. The Splenda sugar blends, brown and white, will also help nix some of the calories! 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#This is one of the best recipes I've kept from Taste of Home...it really is a crowd pleaser.kinwv 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#I would like to know if anyone has substituted unsweetened applesauce for the butter? I would think that would make the cake a little more moist and less fattening. Anyone?
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#I have made this cake several times and it is more than a crowd pleaser every time. It is simply delicious and very easy to make. I made it for the first time for dinner with my mother-in-law and since then she always tells people what a great cook I am!
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#I made this cake and brought it into the office, along with the sauce (which reheats in the microwave beautifully) and a can of whipped topping. The cake was inhaled by my co-workers in what seemed like a matter of minutes. I've made it using a combination of tart and sweet apples when that was all I had on hand, and it turned out just as well. What an awesome recipe. 
Chunky Apple Cake#0#0#elliston - I haven't made this yet, (on the schedule for this afternoon), but frequently apple cakes have a very thick batter, because of the moisture the apples release when cooking. UPDATE: This is great! Moist, lots of apple flavor. Love the fact that it has so many apples, and the butterscotch sauce is perfect with it. 
Corn Pudding#1#4#I made this. It was pretty good. I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and it was still way too sweet. I'll omit the sugar next time. I'd consider this a dessert rather than a side dish but it's good. Note if you make this with cheese, it will be slightly less firmer than without so you may want to lessen a liquid ingredient maybe the milk.
Corn Pudding#3#1#The best ever. A family favorite added at my house.
Corn Pudding#8#0#I've tried a wide variety of corn pudding recipes and this is the best I've found. Made it at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. This will now be my go-to recipe! 
Corn Pudding#26#15#I've made corn casserole since discovering a recipe as a young newlywed from a church fundraising cookbook eons ago, and it has been a great stand-by for many years as my kids grew. I eventually quit making it some years back and now my youngest daughter who is now out in her own tries to make it. The problem is that the industry has changed the cornbread mix formula and they just aren't the same as the ones from back when when this recipe was really popular (which is what prompted me to just stop making it). Corn pudding is a tried and true, it's today's mixes that can mess it up.
Corn Pudding#3#3#Got rave reviews at my Christmas dinner! Delicious!
Corn Pudding#9#0#This moist Corn Pudding recipe was quick to prepare and everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe for Thanksgiving and will definitely be making this again.
Corn Pudding#9#4#This is delicious! It took me 58 minutes in an oval casserole dish to look set in the middle. I opened my cans to find that they were both creamed corn so I found a 12 oz. bag of frozen corn that I microwaved for a few minutes to defrost, and it worked perfectly. I plan to make this recipe all the time.
Corn Pudding#6#1#This recipe tastes very similar to the recipe that has been served at our past family Thanksgivings. I'm so happy to find a corn pudding recipe that's moist and sweet. 
Corn Pudding#2#0#I made this recipe on 10/6/2020! What a scrumptious recipe! A REAL KEEPER, TOO! I did use a smaller can of creamed corn (8.75-oz.) and the standard size of golden kernel corn, well drained and used a 2-qt. square casserole dish! I found that I needed to bake the pudding at least 1 hour, due to the lower oven temperature! This pudding was really moist and fluffy! Thank you for sharing this recipe with Taste of Home!
Corn Pudding#2#0#This is fabulous! I have made other recipes that my husband thought were sort of ok. He loves this. Fluffy, moist, delicious.
Corn Pudding#2#0#My friends and family told me last night that this is cornbread crack!! Lol! Everyone loved it so much! Super easy to make too!
Corn Pudding#0#0#This is so quick and easy to prepare, and tastes amazing! My family loved it; will make it again for sure. It is creamy goodness with crispy browned edges-yum!
Corn Pudding#2#0#have made this many times...the family requests it for all our get togethers...we prefer it with green chilies and cheddar cheese added....yummy!
Corn Pudding#0#0#I made this today to bring for a family potluck and it was a hit! I am definitely making it at home again.
Corn Pudding#0#0#I get rave reviews for this dish EVERY TIME!! And many request the recipe, I'm in my kitchen now making another batch to bring to Thanksgiving dinner! Have a Happy one everybody! :) 
Corn Pudding#2#3#I use a similar recipe with no sugar or milk and only 1 egg. The center is NOT SUPPOSED TO SET. This recipe is for corn casserole, not corn bread. Think of it as a bread pudding texture. Very moist is what makes it so good.
Corn Pudding#1#2#Absolute Breeze, wonderfully tasty. Don't be afraid of the brown! I thought I accidentally left it in too long, but the middle was just nicely set and the edges were a lovely dark crispy brown with a nice bit of browning across the entire top. 
Corn Pudding#0#1#Fabulous recipe. I used Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup. I took the test kitchens suggestion and added 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese and a 1/4 cup of chopped green chilies. We really enjoyed this recipe. VFE.
Corn Pudding#1#0#I used this recipe and me and my mom LOVED it, I used 1/4 sugar instead of 1/2 cup and I did 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of 1 cup. Came out perfectly!
Corn Pudding#2#0#A very similar recipe was given to me by my mother many years ago. My version has no eggs or milk and only one tablespoon of sugar. I bake it in a deep 2 qt. Casserole. Always take it to my office Christmas potluck and get rave reviews and no leftovers! I like the suggestion of adding green chilies and will definitely try that.
Corn Pudding#0#0#Far too sweet for our tastes, even with the sugar cut in half. Next time I will eliminate the sugar altogether and add some salt, pepper, and maybe onion powder. However, it rose beautifully and was light and fluffy.
Corn Pudding#0#2#Followed recipe exactly and casserole did not rise. Daughter made it a few weeks ago and had same results. Perhaps a 9x13 baking dish is too large?????
Corn Pudding#4#0#This is a complete favorite of all my friends, family, and co workers. I do not modify anything other than a few more minutes cook time and I use light sour cream. For all the people saying it takes way longer or is dry (HOW!?) It is not supposed to set from cooking. The very center should very slightly jiggle when done, and if you poke it with a knife is should partially come out clean. If you make this in advance do NOT over cook. It will Set as it cools. 
Corn Pudding#2#1#I have already made this recipe for a long time. I don't like to add as much sugar and I like to use fresh corn when I can. I have made it more like a main coarse and added green chilies and cooked hamburger, ham or sausage and then then added choice of cheese. I have also seen people keep in the sugar and serve it as a desert with ice cream. I also cook mine at 350 degrees for at least 50 minutes. I like it to be a little bit brown on the top. That way you know it is done all the way through. 
Corn Pudding#2#1#First time I made this as written and it was a bit too sweet for my taste, so next time I omitted the sugar (Jiffy mix already contains sugar) and it was 5 stars. I have since made it as a Tex-Mex side with the addition of a can of green chilies topped with Pepper Jack cheese. I also baked at 350 degrees for 50 minutes in order for it to set. Lynne, Volunteer Field Editor
Corn Pudding#1#46#I make corn pudding with fresh corn cut off the cob. I have no use for canned crap...
Corn Pudding#1#0#Simply delicious! I Added 1tsp vanilla, cinnamon and other spice mix.
Corn Pudding#0#0#It has become a family favorite. i always make it on a glass mold so, 325 has worked fine with me.
Corn Pudding#0#0#Very good and simple to prepare. The only change I made was not adding the cream corn and instead 2 cans of whole corn. I would take the advice from others and increase the temperature to 350. At 325 the center was not done.
Corn Pudding#0#0#Love how easy this is to make. But... way too sweet at a half a cup of sugar. Also, bake at 350 or 400 like other recipes suggest. After 50 mins at 325, center still jiggles.
Corn Pudding#0#0#Loved this recipe. Baked it longer than it said though, and I'm wondering if there's a way to make it in a crock pot instead... 
Corn Pudding#0#1#This recipe is easier than making the whole thing from scratch, which my sister does, but tastes equally as delicious! My family is over the top so I adjusted the recipe, added an extra cup of sugar and an extra can of corn kernels. Yummy! More like a dessert though. No more ridiculous than candied yams I guess. Funny how we can turn perfectly healthy foods in to either candy or a heart attack! Happy thanksgiving!
Corn Pudding#0#1#This recipe was delicious. A new addition to our Thanksgiving dinner and an instant favorite. I did modify slightly by only adding 1/2 cup of sugar and I substitute a can of kernel corn for frozen corn. Not to sweet and a great texture!
Corn Pudding#0#0#The only thing I changed was omitting the sugar, and this turned out delicious. I did have to bake it longer than directed. Wonderful dish!
Corn Pudding#0#0#When I made this for Thanksgiving 2 years ago, everyone loved it. It is a staple now.
Corn Pudding#0#0#I made this recipe last night for my family. We had an early Thanksgiving due to me having to work. I made the recipe just as directed and it turned out amazing. My entire family loved it.
Corn Pudding#0#1#Made this for Thanksgiving today and my 2 skeptical adult daughters, who thought corn pudding did not sound very good, both loved it. Made it as outlined in the directions; I was impressed with how light and fluffy it turned out. Cooking time was under 45 minutes. Both of my girls stated that it reminded them of cornbread stuffing. Will definitely be making this again !
Corn Pudding#1#0#This has been a staple at our Thanksgiving table every year for at least 30 years. I also like to make it as an alternative to cornbread as a side dish. I include cheddar and diced fresh jalapenos. For Thanksgiving though, it's the classic incarnation. I don't use canned corn, I use frozen as I feel it's less mushy than canned. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#Perfect side dish for any holiday or Sunday dinner!
Corn Pudding#0#0#I wouldn't really call this a corn pudding. It is a really great cornbread, though. I love the texture and sweetness of this. 
Corn Pudding#0#1#I really didn't want to rate this because I have not tried this specific recipe. I just see people saying that it takes a long time to set. I make one similar. I don't use the eggs, milk or sugar and it turns out great. Takes about an hour at 350. Doubling the recipe will make it take about 30 minutes longer. I use half a box of jiffy corn muffing mix with the corn, sour cream, and butter. 
Corn Pudding#0#1#Made this exactly as written. Took WAY longer than 50 minutes to set . I'm not impressed. Finally set after an hour and a half and was super dry. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#My family loves it!
Corn Pudding#0#0#We make this often. I first tasted corn pudding as a side dish at El Torito Restaurants but their recipe was much more involved. My recipe calls for undrained corn, no milk and NO added sugar. You can also make your own cornbread mix if you don't like using packaged mixes. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#I found this recipe to be very good! I found that I DID need to bake the pudding longer than recipe specified-I baked pudding 45 minute and it was not set. I baked about 25 minutes longer and used a knife to test the pudding. Because of the lower oven temperature, I felt that the pudding was slower to set! delowenstein
Corn Pudding#0#0#This is very similar the recipe I've used for years, except mine does not include the sugar. It also doesn't have the milk; use undrained whole kernel corn for the liquid. (And it specifies to put the corn bread mix in last). Always a huge hit wherever I take it. It's my go-to recipe when I need something that mixes up quickly. (4-star review because I've never made *this* recipe.) 
Corn Pudding#0#0#Absolutely fabulous. Made it exactly as the recipe statedand it was gone in minutes.
Corn Pudding#1#0#I made the recipe as written, and it was very good; but I agree with other reviewers that it is too sweet. Next time I make it I will cut back on the sugar and may add some sauteed onions and/or grated cheddar cheese.
Corn Pudding#0#0#This is a great side dish. I would reduce the sugar, I found it sweet. I would also add some cheese to the mixture next time. Great Thanksgiving side. Goes great with steak too. Loved it.
Corn Pudding#2#0#I've been making this for years! It's a family favorite. As another reviewer wrote, I also saute an onion in the butter and add to the pudding. It's a terrific side dish for barbecue in the summer. We love it! 
Corn Pudding#0#0#I've been making a this for years with a twist. I saute a onion in the butter than pour over top and add a sprinkle of cheese. 
Corn Pudding#2#0#I've been making this recipe ever since it was introduced in a 2006 issue; it's the one EVERYONE asks for. In fact, I'm a little tired of making it for every occasion, but people HOWL when I beg to bring something else! It truly is delicious and everyone loves it; what more can you ask of a recipe? 
Corn Pudding#1#0#Made this a few weeks ago and again tonight. It is very good. My husband loves this recipe. I have never heard of corn pudding before so I thought I would try it. I'm glad I did! 
Corn Pudding#1#0#I made this for Thanksgiving to try something new. Everyone loved it. It was easy and so very yummy!
Corn Pudding#0#0#Fixed this for the first time for a church party and was asked for the recipe - and my hub and said this was a keeper. A similar recipe lacked the rich flavor this does. Definitely a pudding.
Corn Pudding#1#1#Made this for Thanksgiving. Very good. I added 1 Tab sugar, used 11 X 7 pan, was perfect.
Corn Pudding#0#0#I made this for thanksgiving and it came out really nice. I used no sugar, since I was using sweet corn and also egg whites. I plan to make some more tomorrow and will be using less butter. I plan to keep making this. I Absolutely love it!!!
Corn Pudding#0#0#A wonderful first-time addition to our Thanksgiving meal that will now become a family tradition. The whole family, from youngest to oldest, loved it. I followed the recipe as written except I substituted about 2 cups of our home-grown frozen corn for the whole kernel corn.
Corn Pudding#0#0#This was the first time I had made any version of corn pudding and it was a huge hit! Our group of 4 adults and 2 kids finished the pan! Everyone went back for seconds, it was the only part of the Thanksgiving meal that wasn't leftover. So the next day when we were getting ready to eat the leftovers my husband insisted I make another pan! I did cook it longer the first time and preferred it compared to the recipe cook time, but that was the only change. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#Very good. I make it for family dinners.
Corn Pudding#0#0#Yummy, this will be a family favorite
Corn Pudding#0#0#Delicious, will definitely make it again, although I might use less sugar. The cornbread mix I used was very sweet.
Corn Pudding#0#0#Delicious. The whole family loved it. Like a very moist cornbread with some whole kernels in it.
Corn Pudding#0#0#Love this, made it for dinner and it's delicious 
Corn Pudding#0#0#Make it for most holidays. Never any leftover. Great taste and easy to prepare.
Corn Pudding#0#0#This is so delicious! I made it tonight and was just perfect? My kids and husband couldn't have enough. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#Delicious! Perfect texture--not too runny, like some.
Corn Pudding#0#0#I tried a corn casserole at a BBQ and loved it. Searched around for a similar recipe and this one is it. A little sweet with the added sugar, it has a creamy, corny flavor & texture. Very easy to put together-open cans-bam. Could make in advance & reheat. Can cut into squares & freeze. Good base recipe to liven up, or just as it is. Will try a can of mexicorn, green chilies, cheese, fresh corn and onions as others have done. Took 20 minutes longer since I put it in a deeper corningware. I'll just use my Pyrex 9x13 next time. A keeper recipe, I may never make cornbread again! 
Corn Pudding#0#0#Excellent recipe! I think I used a 2 quart dish, so it took longer to bake, but it was a great, sweet-tasting corn dish.
Corn Pudding#0#0#Everyone has their favorite substitutions; I used skim milk, less sugar and it is delicious. I want to try it with asparagus spears on the top! That might be yummy!
Corn Pudding#1#0#Four stars because I made so many substitutions, but this is an easy recipe that adapts well to different tastes. I went the savory route: used only 1 T. sugar, added 1/2 c. chopped onion and 1 chopped jalapeno, sprinkled cheddar cheese on top the last few minutes of baking. Wow - was it good!
Corn Pudding#0#0#This is terrific! I added chopped jalape?o and red peppers to the recipe. It quickly disappeared. Very tasty!
Corn Pudding#0#0#This was so easy and it was the hit of the dinner. I get so tired of just corn, which is the only vegetable my husband wants for holidays. This was a great substitute for just corn.
Corn Pudding#1#0#As written, this is WAY TOO SWEET. So, after making this several times, decided to go savory with the flavors and it was just right.We left out the sugar completely, added about 1/2 cup diced onion, a scant 1/4 cup minced canned jalape?os and about 1/2 cup sharp cheddar. All the rest remained the same. It did take another 10(ish) minutes bake time.
Corn Pudding#0#0#My husband and I love this recipe! I fixed it last night--but I left out the butter, sugar, and substituted plain yogurt instead of the sour cream. I used two boxes of Jiffy Mix and some no salt herbal seasoning from Dollar Tree. Turned out great! And with a lot less calories and fat!
Corn Pudding#0#0#Excellent
Corn Pudding#0#0#This has replaced dressing at Thanksgiving and Christmas. Any leftovers my kids want to take home. I only use 1 tablespoon of sugar and do add a finely chopped Jalapeno, 1/2 red pepper and 1/2 onion but it is good with or without.
Corn Pudding#0#0#This is very good and is always a staple at our Thanksgiving table. Everyone loves it, but I do add strips of green, yellow, and red bell peppers for color and taste, as well as diced onions. My recipe was nearly identical from an insert in our electric bill, but called for two cans of whole kernel, and two cans of cream style, plus 1/2 cup Flour rather than the cornbread mix. Delicious nevertheless.
Corn Pudding#1#0#To bad it's not healthy, because its absolutely the best corn casserole I've ever made. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#This was very good. I made this during the holidays and there wasn't any left. It was a great alternative to just plain corn. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#Made this as written except used whole milk. Came out as described in recipe. Family and I liked. Will make again. I thought it was even better the next day.
Corn Pudding#0#0#I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and crumbled Ritz crackers on top before baking. It took nearly twice the time stated for it to set up, but was the surprise hit of a holiday potluck. I also had to turn the oven up to 350? after the first 45 minutes, it was that runny.
Corn Pudding#0#0#Best corn pudding I ever had
Corn Pudding#1#0#This is great as written, but I tried to cut a few calories and that works too. Try omitting the eggs, milk and sugar. (or at least reduce sugar to 1/4 c) It is still wonderful! Melt the butter and mix all ingredients together. Sometimes when it is done, I sprinkle top with cheddar cheese or jack cheese (if you want a little bite) and put back in oven until it melts. It doesn't need a lot of cheese. Any which way - this is good eatin'!! 
Corn Pudding#0#0#I made the exact recipe as is and it is wonderful everyone loves it...i do add a little cayenne pepper to the top while it's baking for looks 
Corn Pudding#1#0#This was a new addition to our table this Thanksgiving. There was not a kid or grownup, all 25 people who attended, who didn't rave about this recipe! I decided not to use the 1/2 cup sugar...and it was just sweet enough without it. I've already been asked to add this to our Christmas menu! 
Corn Pudding#0#0#This is so wonderful, everyone loves it. It does tend to be sweet so feel free to cut the sugar back if you choose.
Corn Pudding#0#0#My family has made this for years, and it's just not a holiday without it! We make it exactly as written. There may be green bean casserole left-overs, but never corn casserole left-overs! 
Corn Pudding#0#0#I make this often without the sugar and milk, but I'm looking forward to trying it with the sugar and milk. I bet my grandkids will like it better with the sugar.LOL 
Corn Pudding#1#0#I make this without sugar or milk and it is definitely sweet enough. Just took it to a church potluck and I was asked for the recipe
Corn Pudding#0#0#I usually make corn pudding without cornbread mix, but was pleasantly suprised at how much we enjoyed this one, too.
Corn Pudding#0#0#There needs to be one more star for this recipe! I cut the milk a little and bake it in a large glass casserole dish for best results. Excellent with soup, stew, BBQ chicken and game.
Corn Pudding#0#0#This is really good! My sister in law makes corn pudding for family gatherings and I always enjoyed it! I decided I would make this to go with my Mother's Day ham this year. I used House of Autry cornbread mix. I like to by local, and their products are made in NC! 
Corn Pudding#0#0#Delicious! Both my mom and I have made this many times. The only change we make is to use 2 cans of whole kernel corn and leave out the creamed corn. Great side for a holiday or company meal!
Corn Pudding#0#0#My husband doesn't like creamed corn, but he'll eat it in this recipe! Great to take to a potluck. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#Absolute Perfection!
Corn Pudding#0#0#This is a wonderful recipe and we will make it again in the future!
Corn Pudding#0#0#I made this to take to Christmas dinner with friends & all 8 people (including me) loved it. I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup, as many reviewers suggested & it was just perfect. This was a great side dish with ham & green beans, plus orange-cranberry relish. Foolproof & pleasing to all, I'll definitely make it again. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#Works great, even with the quarter cup of oil I had to substitute for an egg because I only had one egg left. Also added half teaspoon of salt and baked just a bit longer than the recommend cooking time because I like mine a bit more firm. All told, I think this is a pretty foolproof recipe. If you like corn and cornbread, you can't go wrong with this recipe. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#This was the third corn pudding recipe that I have tried. It was the Charm . It's sweet and cake-like. It's just been voted new favorite comfort food in our household. The fact that it is super easy to make is a definite working moms plus. As suggested I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and Jiffy Mix and it's perfectly sweet! 
Corn Pudding#0#0#I used 1/4 cup sugar as suggested by others, this was great. Everyone enjoyed it. I made it in a round dish with high sides and it was a bit undercooked in the middle. Next time I'll use a 9x13 pan. Thanks for sharing! 
Corn Pudding#0#0#This is a great recipe. I sometimes use Mexican Style Corn in place of the Whole Kernel Corn. Sometimes I put in chopped Jalapeno with it. Left overs are great too.
Corn Pudding#0#0#I have always loved this recipe. Does anyone know if it can be doubled or tripled and can it be made the day before and reheated for the big event ? 
Corn Pudding#0#0#If you like sweet corn pudding this is the recipe for you. If you don't like it sweet just omit the sugar and use cornbread mix that doesn't have sugar. I like to omit the sugar and add cheese, jalapenos, and onions. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#NO sugar needed especially if using Jiffy cornbread mix. Absolutely delicious. I only make this at the holidays but crave it the rest of the year!
Corn Pudding#0#0#This recipe is a staple at our family gatherings. I sometimes add shredded cheddar cheese, but ususally make it just as the recipe is written. A comfort food for sure.
Corn Pudding#0#0#I've tried numerous Corn Pudding recipes in the past. This was simple and sweet. Family loved it. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#This recipe is GREAT! My family just loved it. I had never made corn pudding before and this was my first time. It came out great and I will definitely make this again and again.
Corn Pudding#0#0#This recipe is wonderful. I did omit the sugar as suggested. Delicious, rather simple and I'll definitely make this again. My family men said the recipe is a keeper. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#My niece made this for Thanksgiving. It was so good. Yes, I will make it.
Corn Pudding#0#0#I added sauted green pepper and onion to add and then put in a small can of diced green chiles. This was a suggestion from a friend in Arizona. Good every way.
Corn Pudding#0#0#Zero sugar needed. I have been making this recipe for a long time. I also cut butter down to 1/4 cup and use low-fat sour cream with no negative effects. Tastes great.
Corn Pudding#0#0#The only adjustment I would make to this recipe is to omit the sugar completely. I have always made this recipe without sugar. It is not needed.
Corn Pudding#0#0#This dish is a must have for every holiday meal. But it is easy enough and good enough to have for Tuesday night dinner. My family loves it and requests it often. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#This is outstanding and so easy to make! To kick it up a bit, we added a can of diced green chiles as well. We also sometimes use 1/4 c. maple syrup instead of sugar - SO good!!
Corn Pudding#0#0#Guests LOVE this dish! I always make it at the Holidays!
Corn Pudding#0#0#I made this recipe this week for a dinner party. It is easy, excellent, good consistency, but, the next time I will use 1/4 c. sugar instead of 1/2. Seemed a bit too sweet. I got a lot of compliments on it, though and will definitely make it again and again..
Corn Pudding#0#0#I make this many times we love it any time, TG, Xmas, New Year or easter!!!
Corn Pudding#0#0#This is a regular holiday and special occasion recipe at our house! My daughter has already requested this and the Golden Potato Casserole for Thanksgiving!
Corn Pudding#0#0#A very pleasing side dish to complete a meal. Because quite a few of the comments mentioned the dish being sweet I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup, and I would probably use only 1/4 in the future.
Corn Pudding#0#0#My sister-in-law brought this to our last family get together. It was fantastic. She sent us all the recipe, as we all raved about it. I can't wait to make it at my next get together with friends. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#Have made this for family get togethers for several years...always a must have request
Corn Pudding#0#0#Is it a vegetable dish or is it dessert?Either way it is absolutely scrumptious
Corn Pudding#0#0#Wonderfully rich creamed corn flavor. Kind of Corn Bread on Steroids ! 
Corn Pudding#0#0#I have a recipe very simular, but it doesn't have sugar in it, it has a little salt. It is a hit with the family. IF theres any leftovers t is good frozen then warmed. And yes, Jiffy is the best muffin mix for it. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#I doubled this recipe and used more creamed corn. Jiffy cornbread is the best cornbread to use. This recipe is excellent. Very very tasty!!!!!!!
Corn Pudding#0#0#what a great recipe the only thing that i did was add a pinch of salt thanks Lauren
Corn Pudding#0#0#My family and friends all loved this dish. I fix it often. It makes any meal a special occasion. Some family members think this should be the dessert.
Corn Pudding#0#0#Very rich and sweet, corn for a dessert.
Corn Pudding#0#0#My mother-in-law suggested that we have a corn dish for Thanksgiving. I had seen this recipe and volunteered to make it. It was very good. A definite keeper!
Corn Pudding#0#0#This is a wonderful recipe. Everyone loved it and we didnt have any left overs at all, which I was hoping for so I could eat some later. Will make this again for sure!!!
Corn Pudding#0#0#I added chopped green onions to it, loved it!
Corn Pudding#0#0#This is excellent. It tastes very similar to the baked corn that a local restaurant sometimes serves. Next time I will decrease or eliminate the sugar since it was a little on the sweet side for us.
Corn Pudding#0#0#YUUUUUMMMYYYYYY!!! This dish is sooooo good. My family raved about it to everyone!!! Totally making this one again ;) 
Corn Pudding#0#0#I have been making this recipie for years but i never put sugar, and it is just as good ...
Corn Pudding#0#0#Even my very fussy daughter liked this! A great sidedish for when everyone's tired of the more usual veggies. And it's a pudding in the same way a plum pudding is called a pudding. A more British version of pudding than what most Americans envision. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#Absolutely! Never fails to be really delicious and has become a family/friends favorite!
Corn Pudding#0#0#everyone looks forward to this recipe - and it goes well with a picnic or a more elegant meal
Corn Pudding#0#0#I took it to a church supper and many people asked for the recipe. I tried it adding a tsp of nutmeg and a tsp of vanilla. Delocious! Thanks. Mary
Corn Pudding#0#0#I really enjoyed this :o) It was quite sweet but that's what I liked about it ! 
Corn Pudding#0#0#Tasty, simple sidedish
Corn Pudding#0#0#The first time I had corn pudding I thought it was going to be awful. I don't know why it's called a pudding, but it sure is delicious! I love it! Pretty simple to make, and so good!! 
Corn Pudding#0#0#Its not supposed to taste like cornbread - which has less sugar.
Corn Pudding#0#0#The sweetness is what makes it such a treat as a side dish! It adds a surprise to the meal. People request me to make this dish for parties all the time, and it always goes fast!
Corn Pudding#0#0#Too sweet. The sugar hides the sweetness of the corn.
Corn Pudding#0#0#My family loves corn so I knew I had to try this recipe. We all liked it, but thought it was sweeter than it needed to be. Next time I'll decrease the sugar by half. 
Corn Pudding#0#0#Remove from oven top with shredded cheddar cheese or shredded swiss cheese and return to oven until cheese is melted.
Corn Pudding#0#0#I made this for Easter Sunday and Everyone loved it!!!! I will make this again. very easy to prepare.
Corn Pudding#0#0#I took this to work for a company Christmas party and everyone went wild over it. It's so easy to make, too. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#2#0#This is hands-down my all time favorite chili recipe and fall/winter recipe in general. I've been making it for probability 10 years now. I'll use ground beef often when that is what I have on hand , with beef or chicken stock and it always turns out great. I typically use 2 lbs of ground because my family prefers meatier chilis , soups and sauces.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This was excellent - thank you!!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I pondered over this recipe for a while, thinking about pumpkin in soup. I'm really glad I tried it, because it is one of my favorite soups. Filling & good for you, with delicious ingredients. Thanks Deborah & Taste of Home. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Very easy and quite filling, it's the perfect chili for autumn/winter. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#6#0#I have been making this for years as a fall and winter staple. We use ground turkey and double the recipe. Every time i make it a little bit different and it never disappoints. We love to use chicken bone broth, and swap out a can of corn for a can of the beans (since i double it i use 4 cans of beans and used whatever is on hand, but always keeping at least 1 can of black beans in) This freezes well and everyone loves it!!!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#2#3#Sounds great. The photo looks like there are avacado chunks in the soup?
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This is so good! I used about 6 small sweet orange peppers as that's what I had. This is going on our regular rotation! Jane B. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#1#This is really a very good recipes
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#9#1#I'll never understand why people insist on changing things about the recipe then rating it especially giving it a bad rating. You didn't technically make the recipe so don't rate it. That being said this chili/soup is awesome just as it is. I make it multiple times throughout the fall and winter. I freese it in single.swvings in ziplocks and have a ready to heat and eat lunch. The pumpkin gives it a richness without tasting pumpkiny. Just the right amount of spice. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#1#0#This is a fantasticly tasty recipe! I used cooked ground turkey and tri-color peppers. I also added a bit more cumin and chili powder. Served with diced red onion, Mexican cheese, and Scoops.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I made this today and ate this for dinner. I thought it was easy to make and it was delicious!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#2#0#I've made this over and over. We all love it. It doesn't take the place of a traditional beef chili if that it what you crave, but I wouldn't expect it to. Wonderful recipe! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#3#I changed this recipe up a great deal. First, I had half a bag of frozen home style meatballs I didn't know how I was going to use so substituted them for the turkey. Then, I thought the spice was too strong so I added another cup of broth. It still needed toning down, so I added half and half to taste. It really turned out quite well. I will just use less cumin next time. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#1#3#Great recipe! Slow cooking is great but it can be made a lot healthier. Instead of a crockpot, I used MEC pure clay pot for this recipe. It cooked a lot faster and the flavor was all natural and enhanced. You should try that and I promise you'd never cook in a crockpot again. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This is one of our favorite chili recipes! I usually substitute ground turkey, ground beef, or ground venison for the cubed turkey and it tastes just as good!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#1#0#Family loves this. I use tomatoes with green chilies to give it some kick.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This was good. I used steak instead of turkey and added chipotle powder. It was a nice change from our usual chili recipe.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#1#1#Husband says it's a keeper! I found this when looking for a different recipe for my leftover Thanksgiving turkey . I used leftover mashed sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin, subbed white beans (great northern) since i didn't have black beans on hand, and my canned diced tomatoes included green chilies. It was delicious! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#wow! wow! Wow! Winner winner turkey dinner ! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#2#0#Excellent recipe! The ingredients are surprising but meld perfectly. The pumpkin adds to the flavor and texture but is not really detectable, which we liked. This recipe is easy, inexpensive and my family loved it. I will be making this regularly. I made it with leftover turkey as directed this time, but will try with ground turkey at other times of the year. The only modifications I made were to use a red bell pepper because that is what I had, and I added a little black pepper.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#3#0#I leave out the meat to make it meatless. Excellent recipe.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I've made this in the past and it's always good. It's nutritious and easily edible by children. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#1#0#This is one of my favorite soups for fall winter. Sometimes I use rotisserie chicken instead or leave out the meat all together. Works great divided up in freezer bags and taken for lunch .
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#One of our favorites! Freezes well too!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#So delicious!! Had it not been for all the great reviews, I might have just passed on this recipe - so glad I didn't! The only changes I made were to increase the salt and add a little pepper. I also used red peppers instead of yellow and chicken instead of turkey, since that is what I had on hand. My whole family loved this, and my kids didn't even suspect there was pumpkin in it. This is so much healthier than my other chili - I will definitely be making this on a regular basis! And FYI, this is even better the next day. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I like the idea of adding pumpkin to chili, and I enjoyed this recipe after I added lots more chili powder ( I like more heat than this recipe called for).
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#1#0#I've made this recipe a couple of times for my annual Super Bowl party. I've made it with the ground turkey and also made it without turkey and with vegetable broth to accommodate a vegetarian guest. Both times the chili was delicious. The pumpkin gives it nice flavor and texture. So easy to throw together and it cooks in slow cooker while I'm preparing appetizers and side dishes. I've made rice on the side and offer cheddar cheese and sour cream for those who want such (have it on hand from the other dishes I make for my party). Also offer tabasco for guests who want more kick. It's my favorite, go-to chili recipe. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This was a tasty recipe and it made the whole house smell wonderful as it was cooking! I took this to a work potluck and the flavors melded nicely for a couple of days before I reheated it. You could really taste all the spices and the pumpkin added a depth of flavor that people couldn't quite figure out what it was until I told them. Very sublime. Great recipe, thank you! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#1#0#I thought I would love it, but it was too soupy and spicy with no pumpkin taste. If I were to make it again, I would another can of pumpkin , one less can of tomato and one less cup of broth. I would use ground turkey and no oregano.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#1#0#I was really looking forward to this chili but was sadly disappointed. I used ground turkey because that's what I had on hand, but the flavor just wasn't what I was expecting at all. I might try it again and leave out the oregano. That just doesn't say chili to me. Based on all the good reviews I really thought I would love it, but didn't. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Wonderful and creamy!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Wonderful. I used chicken instead of turkey and fresh parsley instead of dried.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Loved this ! I used ground pork because I had it. You can probably use any ground or shredded meat. I added a 1/2 cup of salsa and a little more chili powder. I will add another can of pumpkin next time and a couple jalapenos. Toss a little grated cheese on top.Definitely a keeper !!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Yum! We enjoyed this very much. I used 99% lean ground turkey breast instead of the cubed cooked turkey, but made no other changes. Don't worry if you (like my husband) aren't a big fan of pumpkin -- you really can't taste it at all; it just adds fiber and nutrients, and helps to thicken the chili. Bonus for Weight Watchers followers: A generous serving is very low in points and very filling. Try it! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#1#0#This is a simple and good tasting chili!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#1#0#Really good, tastes like a southwestern chili, will make again!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I made as directed, it was WONDERFUL. Very easy, as there wasn't much chopping to do. A very hearty chili & the avocado & green onion topper was perfect. Thanks for yet another very good recipe from Taste of Home. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#1#0#Very good and healthy! I make this often and it freezes well! I have also used browned ground turkey and it is a good substitution.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Delicious, quick and easy! I didn't make any changes to the recipe. My husband and I loved this. It was perfect for lunch on a chilly day. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#We loved it!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I made this and my family devoured it. Only substitutions (because of what I had on hand) were chicken tenders for turkey, fire roasted diced tomatoes (gave a little extra kick) and home made veggie broth that I had frozen previously in place of the chicken broth. This is a great tasting soup/stew and I will be making it again.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This was a big hit in our house. I left the pumpkin part a secret and just told them it was a black bean chili. I used chicken tenderloins that I cooked with the onion, yellow pepper, and garlic. I also doubled the salt and added 1/2 t of ground black pepper. I will definitely be making this again!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Excellent twist on chili. Used pumpkin puree (it's what I had at hand) and added a chunked sweet potato (for texture and bulk). Recipe is quite'mild' as is. I added a tsp of chipotle powder and a bit of crushed pepper in addition to the chili and it still barely tingled. Good fiber and fairly low net carbs. Very easy. Will make again. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Wonderful with leftover turkey
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Soup is delicious - and what a nice change from your typical chili! Even my picky husband loved it. After he had a bowl I told him pumpkin was in it and he gave me the get-out-of-here, don't-tell-me-that' look. I just laughed and I don't know if he realizes pumpkin is really in it or not but eating 2 bowls means he thoroughly enjoyed it! It is a very easy recipe. The only changes I made was I baked chicken tenders (because that it is what I had in the house) to add to the chili and simmered soup on the stove for 45 minutes instead of in the slow cooker. Either way - Delicious!! For those that gave it 1, 2, or even 3 stars - they had to have made a mistakes in making it. And if it was too bland - spice it up! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#My entire family loved this recipe. An easy recipe to make that tastes great. I was short on time so I skipped the slow cooker and cooked it on the stove top for 45 minutes. Couldn't find chunked pumpkin so I used 8 oz of frozen sweet potatoes and 8 oz of frozen butternut squash. I will be making this recipe often. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#A very easy recipe to follow -- and one I make with very few changes -- no yellow pepper but the canned tomatoes are fire roasted and use 1 lb browned ground turkey (more'chili like'). A definite keeper and one for those cold, rainy/snowy nights, served with fritoes on top! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I've made this 3 or 4 times now, most recently for a Halloween themed potluck at work. Because we were supposed to come up with a spooky theme I labeled it Pumpkin Chile with Black Beetles. The beetles, of course, were the black beans. I didn't have any turkey so I sprinkled some Southwestern style seasoning on a package of chicken thighs after removing the skin and baked them. When the thighs cooled off I chopped them up and added them to the chili. I usually cook this on the stove top since I'm not patient enough to wait for the slow cooker. I made a double batch and poured as much as I could fit into the slow cooker the next morning. Several coworkers took some of the leftovers home for dinner. It did come out a little soupy (add broth gradually) but it tasted great. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I made this without the meat (I didn't have any), used vegetable broth (not because I'm vegetarian, but because it's what I had on hand), and I oven roasted about a pound of pumpkin chunks from a small pumpkin and pureed it. I also used a can of Rotel instead of diced tomatoes. Roasting the pumpkin made it really yummy. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Delicious and the pumpkin gave it a different flavor
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#My daughter does not like chili, period. Except this one. She can't digest chili-powder foods very well, but we have found that when I substitute pumpkin pie spice for most (not all) of the chili powder, and add some brown sugar and a bit of cinnamon I have to make a double batch or we won't have any leftovers. Also, when I use ground turkey we like the texture more. Great dish! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I'm allergic to bell pepper so I substituted thinly sliced carrots for texture and it worked really well. Also, I used ground turkey to come closer to a traditional chili. It tasted great. Next time I might double the batch size and freeze some for later. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I made this on the stove top, since I was getting dinner started late. Used diced cooked chicken instead of the turkey, because I always have it on hand in the freezer. Used a full quart of chicken broth (4 cups) instead of the 3 cups called for, because I like more volume. And for the diced tomatoes, I used Del Monte diced tomatoes and zesty jalapenos because my husband and I like spicy. It turned out great!! Definitely a keeper.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Great recipe Added a few jalepenoes for heat. !
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Love this! And it's so easy!! A versatile recipe, ingredients are easily swapped out. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This was a very flavorful chili. I used ground turkey and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies. It could easily be adapted to ground beef as well if that is your preference. I would definitely make this chili again.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!! We always have a big gathering in the fall with friends and family, this is always the favorite.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Yum!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This a great one to make for the fall season. Tasted great. I used ground Turkey in place of cubed turkey. I loved this bc I could also feed this to my son who is now eating solids. I just mashed the beans flat with a fork so they were not a choking hazard and broke the ground Turkey in small pieces while cooking it.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This is one great recipe. We love in the fall and winter, since it gives a great vegatable serving! We spice it up a bit by adding some cayenne and/or jalepeno peppers
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I love a good traditional beef, kidney bean and tomato sauce chili but I think this is one of the best chili recipes I have ever had. The flavor is fantastic though a little mild but it is easy to spice up a little more if desired. I made it with shredded left-over turkey from Thanksgiving.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Use Rotel tomatoes instead of reg to add more spice.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#made this with leftover christmas turkey. You can't taste the pumpkin just a yummy chili. Hits the spot on cold winter days. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Loved this chili. It's delicious, but does not taste like pumpkin at all. I used ground turkey instead of cubed and it was delicious! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This was super easy and inexpensive and my fiance loved it!I took a few suggestions from other reviews:turkey kielbasa instead of chicken1 can rotel instead of diced tomatoes3T chili powder2 cups chicken broth (still a little too soupy for my taste, would likely do 1.5 next time)dash of cayenne pepperdash of red pepper flakes1/2tsp cinnamon
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I make this with ground beef instead of turkey and it is hearty and comforting.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#My entire family loved this. Here are the changes I made: used a red pepper, skipped saute step and put it all in the slow cooker, added another can of black beans, used 2 large cans of chicken instead of turkey, added 1/2 teaspoon of chipotle chili powder, used 2 teaspoons of salt. Also I had made some corn stock (from left over cobs that I had frozen the corn off, Eugina Bone's recipe) and used that instead of chicken broth. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#One of the best chili recipes! I make this every year in the Fall and Winter. Everyone I make it for ALWAYS ask for the recipe.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This is more than excellent and I wish I could give it more stars.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Fantastic! Would rate a six if I could! So unique to have a chili that doesn't have a'red sauce' flavor. Will be a regular! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This is a monthly meal. For our family i use half black bean, half northern. I add 2 tsp cinnamon, and 3+ tbsp brown sugar. Since peppers are hcrazy expensive when we want to eat it, i freeze chopped fresh peppers in the summer.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#What a wonderful surprise! Very easy to make and tastes fabulous. A nice addition to my gluten-free menu.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Wow! This recipe makes the best, just all-around classic-tasting chili! If you're craving a good, simple-tasting chili, this is it. The pumpkin gives the chili a nice thickness but doesn't impart any flavor. Its just good! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I make this dish regularly in the cold weather months. Love it!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Love this recipe. i've made it several times and it always turns out delicious.only thing i changed was double the spices,added a Tblsp. of hot sauce and i also used ckn because thats what i had in the fridge.quick and easy recipe. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Good fall soup:)
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Based on previous reviews that it was too soupy, cut the chicken broth to 2 cups. Also substituted 1 10 oz can Ro-Tel original plus 1/2 of 8 oz can tomato sauce for the diced tomatoes. Used rotisserie chicken instead of turkey and replaced the yellow pepper with celery. Garnished with sour cream and crushed tortilla chips. Didn't really taste the pumpkin as much as it just gave it a wonderful earthy taste. The whole family loved it! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This was very very YUMMY, but I did need to add a lot more spice to it. I used about 3 TBS of Chilly powder and 1 tbs of Cayenne pepper and I don't like things to be spice, but this made it just spice enough! YUM YUM 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I made this, but after reading some of the reviews that thought it was a little bland, I decided to use chunky salsa in place of the diced tomatoes and I used turkey sausage instead of the cooked, diced turkey. It was delicious....I will definitely be making this again and sharing the recipe with my friends
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Unique and very tasty.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#i made it for about 20 souls they all loved it
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Delicious! Yes, I did tweak the spices, cut back to 1 cup chicken broth to make it chunkier & left out the turkey to make it very low-cal, but it was good. Just add more spice. Tastes like a spicy butternut-squash soup...I even thought I might use my immersion blender & process it very smooth. Lots of ideas with this basic soup!!!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Very easy and healthy. I agree with previous reviews that it needed extra spices. I added a lot more chili powder and some cayenne pepper. Then it was delish!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I love this recipe, but it definitely needs more spices. I added more chili powder, garlic powder and salt. This will definitely become a fall staple.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Happened across this recipe linked from a blog I was following and decided to whip it up. I made some minor adjustments for tasted, but mostly followed the recipe. Everyone who ate it gave it great review.The blog that linked it suggested using Kielbasa sausage instead of turkey cuts (seemed odd), and it worked out great. I also cut the broth to 2 cups because I wanted it less soupy and it worked well for that. Also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes for some added heat. Spot on perfect.Next time I might try using a ground turkey sausage for meat, and maybe add some corn to the mix.Quick and easy recipe to enjoy - have at it!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I really like the idea of the pumpkin and it does thicken the chili nicely, but I also found the chili to be a little bland. It really needs a little more salt, chili powder, and a bit of sweetness to bring out the flavors and enhance the pumpkin. So I added 2 T of Frank's hot sauce, a bit more chili powder, 1 T of packed dark brown sugar and 2 Splenda packets to sweeten a bit more but not wreck the nutritional value of the recipe! Chili and the intensity of flavors is a personal preference... I've modified the recipe to our family's preferences! I will make this again! Thanks for the great idea! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This was so good!! The pumpkin was perfect as a thickening agent. I'm putting this on my Halloween dinner party menu!! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#My kids and I love this .
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Came out really soupy. Next time would add chicken broth by only a fraction.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I have made this multiple times. The first few times I made it I only used 2 cans of chicken broth and substituted tomato puree or paste for the canned tomatoes. This recipe is a little tricky just because if you don't have a good balance of spice, the pumpkin can be a little funky if you're not a huge pumpkin fan. My family really likes it, and overall they are generally picky eaters. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#It just tasted funny to me.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#The pumpkin adds a creamy, delicious texture. I made this one vegan by omitting the meat and using veggie broth :)
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I really changed some things in this recipe but plan on trying the original when i have all the ingredients. I used extra beans and cubed chicken (did not have turkey) didn't have yellow pepper so used frozen summer squash diced. also out of tomato's so used salsa which made it so thick so used extra broth. Not done yet buy did taste test and its wonderful and soooo full of flavor. The five stars if because I already know the original recipe is great without trying it yet. I also sauted the chicken pieces in the olive oil then the onionsand garlic along with the bits of goodies left in the pan.... wonderful!thank you for the great recipe.... 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Delicious and easy! I used ground turkey and half the black beans and served it over spaghetti noodles. Yum!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#this was great! substituted out the tomatoes and replaced with more pepper. Also added more pumpkin. It was great! everyone loved it
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Works out well if cooked on stove top as well. I have made this with ground turkey when I didn't have any leftover turkey to use because the family loves it! It turns out tasty either way 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This Black bean and Pumpkin chili recipe is terrific! Very fast and simple preparation. However, I did add 1Tbsp. tomato paste, 1 can of pinto beans, cooked and crumbled bacon. I also used basil instead of parsley and oregano only because I ran out. Defiantly adding this recipe to my recipe book!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Loved this recipe we actually used chopped Chorizo instead of Turkey. Yum Yum, even my little kids liked it!!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Neither my husband or I are pumpkin fans but this was excellent. Will make again for company.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Made this twice in two weeks, once to try and again to serve for company. I did add half a can of tomato paste to thicken up, but I like my chili thick. Very tasty!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I made this last night with a pre-cooked turkey breast from the supermarket deli. I made it on top of the stove instead of in the crock pot and let it simmer for about and hour to blend the flavors. I had about 3/4 of a can of pumpkin left over from a coffee cake I had made last weekend and it worked out fine. I used lower sodium chicken broth and black beans and it was still salty enough for us. I also substituted a can of mild diced tomatoes with chiles for the regular diced tomatoes. I noticed one reader said that the recipe turned out too soupy. Try taking the lid off and cooking it on high a little longer in the crick pot or simmering it with the lid off for a few minutes on top of the stove. My husband and son both rated this a 5. The best part is that they never guessed it had canned pumpkin in it.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This is so delicious! I made it for my Recipe Club and everyone loved it. I have made it several times since. It is fantastic flavor, easy to make and soooo good for you!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I made this on the stove and my friends and family loved it! I made it 3 times in one week!!! Loved it!!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#when i make chili i brown the meat then add all the spices and let simmer for 20 min,it seems like then u can taste the spices better.I used ground turkey and one can of (Red Gold) petite diced tomatoes with chilies (Hot) lots more flavor. used one can black bleans and one can dark red kidney beans did not add the yellow pepper- hubby does not like peppers in his chili. thanks for sharing!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#My husband and I loved this Chili recipe! It was hearty and healthy too. I used ground turkey in place of the cooked turkey and it was great! Definitely a keeper! :)
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I didn't use the chicken broth I used a large can of crushed tomatoes, + a spicy can of diced tomatoes, along with extra spices, + sugar, the taste is a bit bland w/o the extra ingredients, oh and lots of hot sauce. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Doubled the recipe and added a rotisserie chicken to it and it was wonderful!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I feel bad writing this because everyone else liked it so much, but for my family it had no kick at all. Chili is suppose to have some kick right? If you like your chili runny and bland, then I guess this would be good.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#loved it, pumpkin gave me less of a problem with stomach acid afterward that I typically have with chili. No tums for me
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#forgot to mention that i use chicken instead of turkey
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This is my ALL TIME favorite recipe! As soon as the fall temps arrive it is the first thing I make. I am on Weight Watchers and this recipe fits right into my plan! Full of healthy, hearty and yummy ingredients!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Made this recipe this past weekend and absolutely loved it!! Family was a little unsure about the pumpkin in it until they tried it...my boys couldn't get enough!! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I add 1 lb of ground cooked turkey so I can make it more often. My family, one who is very picky, love this soup. It is very filling and I serve with corn muffins - it's always a hit. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#so yummy will make many more times before the weather warms
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I made this for my family it fit into the weight watcher plan and they all loved it and could not guess the secret ingredient.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I used ground turkey, added a 4 oz can of green chilies, and another teaspoon of chili powder. Took it to a chili cookoff and it came in 2nd place. Many compliments on it.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This was absolutely delicious! I can't wait to make it again. Can't say enough about it, it was great.I mostly like regular chili recipes, this was a little different, will be my new favorite. You HAVE to make this!!!! Deserves more than 5 stars! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Yum! For our tastes, I omitted the yellow pepper, and grilled a couple chicken breasts on the indoor grill to replace the turkey. Used part of a packet of chili seasoning instead of the spices called for, and added a can od whole kernel corn for a bit more sweetness. Served it with shredded cheddar, tortilla chips and sour cream. Hubby loved it - even after I confessed about the pumpkin!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I took it to a potluck untested. Everyone loved it, its a keeper!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I took it to a potluck untested. Everyone loved it, its a keeper!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Excellent - I doubled the recipe as I had 29oz can of pumpkin, there was enough room in the large crockpot.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#For a little extra kick, I added a chopped jalapeno. It is so good, my husband requested that I make it for him to take deer hunting to share with the gang.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Not impressed at all, but much better than the last bean soup I made.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This is a great seasonal twist to keep the family's taste buds happy. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Excellent chili! I was skeptical because the recipe did not call for my usual chili ingredients; however, it was super! I substituted white chicken cubes (Schwan's product) for the turkey. Definitely a keeper and will make again! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I was a little apprehensive about this one, but boy was it tasty. I think this will be one of my favorites this fall. Absolutely delicious.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I think I would try chicken next time. I would have liked a bit stronger pumpkin flavor as well. I tossed in a dash of cinammon, which added a nice flavor.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I used a roasted chicken. It was very good.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#this chili is wonderful & low cal.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Very good! I made this vegetarian by substituting tempeh for the turkey and vegetable broth for the chicken broth. I steamed the tempeh and then sautéed it with olive oil and a dash of chili powder, then added it to the slow cooker with the other ingredients. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again! Yum!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I made this recipe for the Misplaced Mission Chili Cook-Off at our church today. I not only won first place in the non-traditional chili category but also won the Grand Champion trophy. Everyone loved it. This was the first prize I ever won. It was very exciting and pleased all who tried it. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This chili is awesome!! My family requested that make it again but with more beans and corn. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I made this multiple times last Winter! It is yummy as well as very nutritional. I love it!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Everyone who has every eaten this at my house loves it. I have made it a few times since I saw it here a couple of years ago. Tried, true and great for you!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I took it for a work potluck and didn't tell anyone it had pumpkin in it until they tried it. I went home with an empty crockpot! I love that it's so healthy! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Have made this twice now, and it is yummy! I used a pound of ground turkey breast, browned instead of cubed turkey. My kids even liked it. You don't taste the pumpkin, and it makes it more nutritious! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Tremendous! I wish there was a choice for 6 stars! Unusual ingredients make up one delicious chili. So good- just try it.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I used freshly cooked (mashed) butternut squash in mine and put quite a bit extra in. Delicious! (You don't taste the pumpkin.) 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Excellent healthy chili - thanks! Just printed it out to give to my daughter.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This chili is fantastic! My six year old gobbles it up.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#AMAZING!! I added an extra teaspoon of chili powder, and decreased chicken broth by 1 cup. My husband daughter and just loved it.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I made this with ground beef instead of turkey, red beans instead of blacks, and added more salt and other seasonings (some southwest chipotle seasoning, additional cumin and chili powder) than the reciped indicated. Very hearty and filling - we liked it very much. Served with shredded cheddar on top. We will definately have this again!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS....I'M NOT A HUGE CHILI PERSON, BUT THIS IS SOOOOOO GOOD...COULDN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT....I DIDN'T USE THE PEPPERS AND USED MILD ROTEL FOR THE CANNED TOM. AND GROUND TURKEY....DELICIOUS!!! SERVED IT A PARTY, EVERYONE LOVED IT, AND YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW THEIR IS PUMPKIN IN IT! 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I used a can of diced tomatoes w/ green chilies instead of plain diced tomatoes to add more flavor. Everyone loved it!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Everyone in my house thought this was extremely tasty & had seconds, I added red chili flakes for some heat & used beef broth because I was out of chicken, the pumpkin makes its thick & rich, deelish!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#For a Meat Free ... Spice to taste .. Omit the Meat .. Subsitute the Meat and or Broth as You would With Your Favorite ... WAH LA :)
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I really liked this recipe but I added more beans and I used kidney beans because I was out of black beans
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Delicious! I substitute 2 extra cans rinsed drained black beans for the turkey, as we generally prefer the beans to the turkey. Crush up some tortilla chips on top and add a sprinkle of cheddar...YUM!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Black Beans N Pumpkin ChiliI made this for my husbnd and son. I added more chili powder, a little onion salt and pepper. When I served it I put sredded cheddar cheese on top and ate it with ritz crackers for a spooon! I rate it delicious and there was no detection of pumpkin. Very nutricious. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I made this for supper today.  I had left over chicken from supper last night and thought I'd try this.   I added a little more chili powder and fresh tomatoes from the garden.  My dh and I thought it was very good.  You would never know there was pumpkin in it. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#My husband and I love this chili! I really enjoy the sweeter flavor. We use ground turkey and sometimes add a half a can more of black beans
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This is a delicious chili! I wasn't sure what my kids would think of the pumpkin, but they loved it! I used mild Rotel for the diced tomatoes, 1 lb ground turkey for the diced turkey (I browned it before adding it to the slow cooker) and low sodium chicken broth instead of regular chicken broth. I've made this chili many times and look forward to making it again now that the fall weather is almost here. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#One of the very best chili's I've ever had. Very little heat but thoroughly enjoyed by childrenteancum 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This is my new faveorite chili
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This is my new faveorite chili
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#YUM!! I served this for the first time on Halloween night, after we got back from Trick or Treating. It warmed us up in no time! It will now be a Halloween night tradition. I've shared this recipe with everyone I know. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I love this and have been eating it all week. I am taking it to a chili cook off tomorrow night. The only thing I would change is to decrease the chicken broth 1/2 to 1 cup. The consistency with 3 cups made the chili more soupy, I prefer my chili thicker.
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I love this recipe and have made it several times already. It isn't very spicy...but I prefer it that way so that my guests can spice it to their liking 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This is my new favorite chili recipe!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#This chili was phenominal! It was so easy to make and was so flavorful. The only addition I did was to add a minced jalapeno pepper! My family loved it! I will definitely make it again!!!
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#I made this for a get together and people declared it the best chili they had ever eaten. I thought it was good, but slightly bland and needs a little something else. 
Black Bean n' Pumpkin Chili#0#0#Everyone in my family that tried it thought it was great. For my taste, I thought it was a bit bland and added hot sauce to it for myself. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#1#5#Honestly haven't made this yet, but it looks scrumptious! Question, though - approx. how thin should thinly sliced potatoes be?  ¼-inch, ?-inch...? I want these to come out as yummy as they look/sound! Thanks! 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#8#6#Made this last night. The BEST au-gratin potatoes I have had. Follow the recipe as written but omitted the onions.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#6#3#My family enjoyed the recipe. This was a good basic recipe and worth keeping. A great template or just fine as is! I added the salt after I melted the cheese just because I didn't have a full cup of cheddar and made up the difference with processed cheese which tends to be saltier. In fairness, the recipe states after you uncover the potatoes that the cooking time will be 30 - 40 minutes or longer if your potatoes aren't tender. In my experience, it does usually ends up taking about two hours. Is it my oven, the thickness of the potatoes, or the type of potato? Who knows! What I know is that like the recipe and I would make this again. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#10#0#Delicious! My kids are picky eaters and loved them too. Made the recipe with no changes or substitutes. Will be making again!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#16#19#Although I don't luuuurve their delivery, I agree with the other reviewers that this recipe could be cooked longer and could benefit from much more seasoning . It's tricky to find that perfect balance between firm and mushy potatoes, but the recipe as followed yielded crunchy potatoes. Thus, I increased the heat and the cooking time. I used Gruyère and white cheddar, sautéed shallots, and in addition to salt and pepper, added my secret makes-every-recipe-amazing spice blend for flavor ( https://silkroadspices.ca/products/scarborough-fair ) I also sopped up the oil that rose to the top with a paper towel, sprinkled the top with parmesan (maybe overkill, but if tons of cheese is wrong, I don't want to be right), and then broiled for a few moments before letting it sit. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#9#4#Great recipe! I cooked it 10 minutes longer but other then that it was great! My fussy husband loved it!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#20#10#I am making this recipe. I am 60 years old, I tell my wife to always remember were 60 years old. Because she said that is an old recipe! No, it is a basic recipe most 20-30-40 year olds never made it. Very good recipe. Thanks.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#17#1#I have made this recipe several times, and it is the best au gratin potato dish I've ever eaten. I recycled the leftovers into a potato cheese soup by adding a bit more milk or chicken broth. Excellent taste and texture. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#9#2#These are great! I omitted the onion because no one in my family likes the physical onion but I did add a few teaspoons of onion powder, garlic powder and some fresh parsley to my sauce mixture. Also used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 mozzarella cheese
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#12#2#We lovingly call these potatoes Old Rotten Potatoes (Au Gratin Potatoes). This particular recipe is very similar to the way my wife makes it. We made this recipe and the church potluck group loved it! 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#11#5#Wow! This was a big hit at our Christmas dinner. I followed the recipe except I only had a little bit of cheddar cheese, 1/4 c, so I added what I had on hand to hit the full cup. Monterey cheese and mexican cheese, plus some garlic, parsley and basil. I hid some of the leftovers, so I could enjoy it for lunch the next day! ??
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#8#1#Excellent dish. Delicious!!! It got lots of compliments at the Solstice potluck.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#10#0#Can I possibly give this more than 5 stars????? Even my super picky 9 year old devoured it! Thank you seems incredibly inadequate
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#28#0#I followed the recipe, using whole milk and extra sharp cheddar cheese, but made 2 additions. I added a 1 /2 cup of parmesan cheese and 1/2 teaspoon of Dijon mustard. Came out amazing! Will absolutely make this again!!!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#47#70#This recipe is a good starting point, but I made 2 modifications (one immediate, one on my second try) in order to make it a really good dish. I skipped the butter the second time, instead bringing the milk to a simmer and adding the flour to thicken it. When I used the butter, I got quite a bit of excess grease sitting in the corners of the pan. I know butter is a key component of a béchamel sauce, which is the base of this dish, but you're adding enough cheese that you don't need the richness butter provides, and if it cooks out and forms a layer of grease it's not adding to the recipe anyway.1/8 tsp of black pepper is an insultingly small amount for a recipe this large. If you use that little pepper in your cooking, please never invite me to dinner. I know the recipe says additional pepper optional, but it really isn't. This recipe makes 8 servings. 1/64th of a teaspoon per serving might as well be nothing. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#17#1#I added 2 small chopped onions and about 3 cups of sharp cheese. Even though my potatoes were very thinly sliced it took about 2 hours to cook. But when I showed up at my neighbor's cookout everyone loved my dish!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#12#3#Recipe worked well, I used whole milk, Gouda, and russet potatoes. Season to taste. I had to cook it for over an hour.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#7#2#Followed the recipe and it turned out delicious! I used food processor to slice potatoes as was suggested. I did sprinkle some paprika on before baking because I think it's fun and pretty. Next time I plan to decrease salt to 1 teaspoon. It turned out perfect!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#13#3#A really nice uncomplicated recipe. I par boiled my potato's . Layered them with a little cheese and sauce in between each layer. Used just 2 russet potatoes and I got 3 layers. Also added a little minced garlic to the milk mixture. Very good. Used Mexican cheese blend.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#21#22#The recipe is a good starting point; four stars only because it really does need to be tweaked. First, it is yet anoth recipe for a family of six; I'm retired and ofteen cook for myself alone (my wife prefers other things). So, down to one really big Russet potato put through the mandolin at an eighth-inch setting, then cut into smaller pieces. Second, the sauce as described (and then scale down) is too thick; I found myself addding more ½&½ (more cream flavor, and not so fatty as heavy cream). Third, cheddar is nice, but I also threw in some store-bought 4-cheese pizza cheese. I also used some on top during the uncovered baking time -- nice lightly browned top. Fourth, Imade this a one-dish meal: a layer of sauce, a layer of potato + a bit more sauce and a layer of sliced baked ham + a bit more sauce, another layer of potatoes and the rest of the sauce. The baking instructions (adjusted a bit for a convection oven) were spot on; the covered cooking time; I added the extra chees on top, then did the uncovered baking time (again, adjusted downward for a convection oven). A quick (and gentle) stire after a short time sitting just after coming out, brought the sauce together neatly and the result was very satisfactory. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#12#8#The best potato gratin I have ever made or tasted! Only added fresh grated garlic plus extra black pepper, sea salt and fresh thyme. I even used part semi skimmed milk part skimmed milk and the roux still cooked up lovely and thick. Firm texture and cuts well hot or cold. Freezes well too.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#4#78#This recipe should have'NO STARS! I have never heard of baking thinly sliced potatoes for an hour and a half...seemed strange...but I tried it...what a mushy, nasty mess! Absolutely no taste, as others said bland! This recipe needs to be thrown out, or needs to be tweaked to the point that it is edible...I think I will stick to throwing it out. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#4#26#This recipe is extremely bland. Definitely use more salt and other seasonings. The end result was not worth the time or effort.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#15#2#You should cook the potatoes 1st
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#2#13#Unmitigated disaster!!!!!!!! Followed this recipe to the letter. The potatoes were still hard and the sauce curdly and soupy. I put it back in the oven and it took nearly another hour for the potatoes to soften. I had to finish the serving in the microwave. The sauce just did not hold up. I have no idea why... but I am going with a different ratio of ingredients next time
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#2#Ok, I've made these 3 or 4 times now and they always come out greasy. I follow the recipe and use cream instead of milk, and there is always pockets of grease when I take them from the oven. The flavor is good, potatoes are done, but grease on top. Any suggestions? ...Rick. rick@drenfam.com 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#12#0#This was the best au gratin potatoes I've ever made. Every slice of potato was covered in creamy cheese sauce. i used half and half instead of the 2% milk. I'll never make them in the layered method again! 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#12#1#I like au gratin potatoes and was raised on the Betty Crocker boxed ones, problem is my wife hates the consistency of boxed ones. Made these yesterday and we both loved them. Simple and easy to make, we had the leftovers with tonight's dinner and may even have tasted better rewarmed. Definitely keeping this recipe! 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#8#0#As another reviewer stated. First time followed the recipe to the letter. It turned out ok, was just a little too bland for our taste. Tweaked this time with a little more seasoning and a tad more cheese. Oh, and I topped with breadcrumbs after uncovering.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#I have made this twice, the first time I followed the rescipe but T and to the t and although very delicious my husband and I thought we would add more cheese so stay tuned will let everyone know how they turned out
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#3#0#Excellent recipe altered the timing but over all great thanks for sharing
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#I just made these for the first time today. I mixed part sharp cheddar and a Mexican mix. That's what I had. Very good. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#2#0#Very tasty. I used bits of several different cheeses and reduced the salt. Cooking a hour
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#1#0#Great flavor........watch the salt, I found it to be too much.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#1#3#Why would you cook potatoes for an hour and 40 minutes?
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#1#0#These are absolutely delish! I made a few slight changes the second time and since even better...switched out the milk with heavy whipping cream and used 1 1/2 cups of cheese instead and baked uncovered for 50 minutes to get the top crispier! EVERYONE asks me for this recipe now
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Excellent but I think ?? half 2% and half heavy cream would of been better along with a bit of salt or some type of seasoning. But overall fantastic
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#The family and neighbors LOVED this!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#this was perfect for us and exactly what I was looking for Easter - I doubled for a 9x13 pan - used cheddar/jack shredded cheese (family preference) - used 3 cups fat free milk and one cup half and half- so good!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Great Recipe, made the recipe exactly as written except I used whole milk. They were great with my ham for easter, This recipe is a keeper.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#This was THE BEST recipe we have found in years. Your sauce was deeeelish. I didn't have any milk. So, I used Heavy Whipping Cream, instead. Thank you for sharing. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#2#1#On Easter, I followed the recipe exactly* (except adding some cayenne pepper- a family must) and everyone, even my really picky son, loved it. A perfect side dish for ham. Very easy to make. *Since the russet potato slices are thin, I didn't peel them- which added nutrition and flavor- and it wasn't noticeable. The oven temp and cooking time were exactly right. The potatoes were tender but not mushy. Unanimous decision to make it an Easter tradition. Thanks Taste of Home. I'll check back with you again. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#I love au gratin potatoes .This recipe is scrumptious. I added a bit more cheese, then topped it was little more cheese after I took the cover off. This one is definitely a keeper.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Absolutely delicious! This one is definitely going to see some regular action with me. I would recommend sprinkling some mozzarella over the top when you take the top off before the last 30-40 mins of baking. Gives its a lovely stringy chewy cheesy crust.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#1#This is an amazing recipe. I tweaked it a little. I omitted the onions and used onion powder, replaced the milk with heavy cream and used 1/2 Vermont Cheddar and 1/2 Sharp cheddar and 2 slices of pepper jack cheese. Someone suggested that I partially cook the potatoes first so after I sliced them I microwaved them for 10 minutes. I have never had such delicious AuGratin potatoes!! This is a keeper!!!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#2#0#This recipe is a great Au Gratin base. We use a little extra cheese on top and add some fresh herbs. For the one star review, you have it backwards, scalloped potatoes do not have cheese, au gratin potatoes do.... Also, these are PLENTY tender if you follow the directions of cooking for 1 hour covered and then an additional 30-40 minutes uncovered, no need to precook unless you would like to avoid the first hour of covered cooking.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#My husband loves this recipe and he can't get enough of it. I'm putting it in the fav recipe box. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Used a tablespoon of dried onion flakes instead of a half cup onion to accommodate my husband's preferences. And added a healthy sprinkle of cayenne. Was worried it would be salty, but it was not. Next time I may opt for salt substitute or a blend. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Literally exactly like my grandma used to make. Absolutely delish!!!!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#1#0#Sooooo good! Delicious and simple to put together. It is also easy to experiment with. I added French's fried onions to the top for the last 30 minutes of baking. Honestly, that one star review made me LOL and want to try out this recipe. If I couldn't eat these amazing potatoes I would be disappointed, too! 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#My husband and I both loved this recipe. Easy to put together, turned out perfectly, we'll use it again and again. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars, to make up for the person earlier this month who gave it only 1, without making it and in spite of saying it sounded delicious, due to not being able to eat cheese and apparently not understanding what gratin means... 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#I tried this recipe. Easy and the best. My husband and i loved it so much
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#4#Why do people called scalloped potatoes au gratin? Unfortunately I can't have cheese. I've wasted so much time looking for recipes only to find they have cheese. These do sound delicious for scalloped potatoes.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#1#0#Made this tonight!! Awesome!! I had some left over Velveeta Cheese from the super bowl rotel dip, so I used 8oz. Of that for e cheese and topped it with Colby Jack. Also added some garlic powder in with the salt and pepper.... My wife said it was the best she ever had!!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#By far the best au gratin recipe I've ever used 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#1#Why does it say to use peeled potatoes, but the video shows unpeeled ??
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Tasty! I made this in my Ninja Foodie to save time. Just had a little extra milk for the pressure cooker.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#I loved this recipe the first time I made it! I found that if I stack up the potatoes and onions in my 8x8 Pyrex dish, and pour the cheesy rue over them to make it even better the second time I made it! However, using this method, pouring a drizzle of milk on top before covering keeps the whole dish very creamy! Family and friends always rave about it!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#I have found my go-to au gratins! This recipe is easy and cheesy. Used a blend of regular and sharp cheddar. Haven't used the onion to date as I usually save that for scalloped potatoes. Freezes well. Just bake at 350 from frozen, covered in a prepared pan, with a splash of milk for about an hour. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#This recipe is so easy and delicious. I like it because it doesn't have mustard in the recipe. I have made this twice and delicious every time. Also, I sliced the onions thin once and diced them the other time. Both times delicious. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#I love this recipe! After I made the sauce I realized that I didn't have enough so I made half of the recipe 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#I doubled the recipe and tripled the cheese. Replaced the 2% with whole milk. Also added a little garlic powder and paprika. Delicious! ?????????
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#2#0#After further evaluation this recipe is bumped up to three stars. To get it right, you must cook the dish at lower temperature for a longer duration. I found starting at 400 for 40 minutes and then dropping the temp to 300 in a convection oven for 90 minutes to be successful. The cheese bechamel is still holding and the potatoes are cooked as far as I can tell using a toothpick to test the softness. Feel free to add your own touches to make this dish your own. Overall an kk recipe but it needs work to turnout properly.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#This recipe is easy
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#5#0#I use the sauce in this recipe for either potatoes or macaroni. It's very reliable. I usually double the recipe if I'm cooking for my family of six. A nice touch is to sautee chopped onion in the butter at the beginning, and then continue as instructed with the onion included in the sauce. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#2#1#I followed this recipe exactly. I think people that have included in their review that the potatoes were not cooked enough did not interpret the recipe correctly. I believe the recipe could be more clearly written that after you cook covered for 1 hour, you THEN remove the cover and cook for an ADDITIONAL 30-40 minutes. That is plenty of time-- the potatoes were quite soft. You DEFINITELY do NOT need to precook the potatoes first. That is a waste of every working person's limited time. Do be aware that you need to set aside AT LEAST TWO HOURS of time to prepare, cook, and cool this dish. I liked it a lot but would add a bit more than the 1 cup of cheese the next time. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Looks easy enough. I never made this before, I always used the box but after looking at the video, I will make this from scratch from now on.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#I would love to get the ingredients for 50 people or more.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Excellent classic dish. I double the sauce with 3 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese for 7 to 9 medium potatoes. I bake at 400 for 1 hour for more browning on top.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Sorry I mistakenly submitted my review. Anyhow I sautéed the onions in the melted butter, added the flour and cooked a few minutes to cook out the flour. Heated 2 cups 1% Milk
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Used 1/2
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Delicious!! I used 9 medium/large potatoes, doubled the sauce/cheese ingredients and used a 9x13 baking dish. I omitted the onion, not by choice, but because I simply forgot to put them in! Still, these potatoes were wonderful. I baked them about an hour and fifteen minutes, covered, and then continued to bake another thirty minutes, uncovered. They came out perfect. The potatoes were tender and covered in the cheesy sauce. Perfect accompaniment to the glazed ham we had with it. Will keep this recipe handy anytime I need a potato side dish!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Oh My Goodness this recipe/dish was so good it became an instant favorite in our house and I will make it again
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Made this multiple times. This is a simple good recipe. I use extra sharp cheese and grate extra to sprinkle on top during the last 30 minutes of cooking.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#2#1#After having read most of the reviews, I put the sliced potatoes in cold water and boiled them for 10 minutes only. I then added about half a cup of gruyere cheese and half a teaspoon of smoked paprika, to the sauce and poured it over the warm potatoes and baked it according to the recipe,it was amazing
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Excellent and easy recipe. I ended up with about 6 cups sliced potatoes, cut the salt to 1 tsp, and used 1 1/2 cups cheese. Sauce-to-potato ratio was perfect, but I did have to bake mine an extra half hour. Thanks for the great recipe...will be adding this to my rotation!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#As mentioned before, potatoes were still quite firm at the end of the cooking process. I think an adjustment in the baking temperature to 375 or even 400 would fix this. I hand cut my potatoes and I felt I cut them fairly thin but maybe a thinner cut is also needed.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#1#Super easy to do. I added garlic powder for some flavor and more pepper than was called for. I baked at 350° for 40 minutes (more like 42 as I didn't hear the timer right away!) and they were perfect. The family LOVED them! I'll be adding this as a regular recipe to pull out for a side! 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Was easy, but I thought it needed more flavor.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#1#0#Was tasty when it finally finished cooking but the time listed in the recipe was way off! The potatoes were still hard after an hour and it took another half hour at 450 before they were soft enough to eat.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#1#0#a favorite of mine and my boyfriend, I add about six strips of bacon chopped and a can of sweet corn. it gives it a smoky summer feel
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Easy, quick and Amazing! The family ate them all up. My daughter is always asking for augratin potatoes and since we stopped cooking from a box, this is the first recipe I tried and it's a keeper. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#1#0#These are delicious scalloped potatoes.I used evaporated milk instead of 2%. It gives them a richer flavor.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#1#0#Fantastic recipe! I had some potatoes I needed to use up so ended up increasing the amounts of everything but salt by half. I also didn't have shredded cheddar on hand so I used 1/2 Mozzarella and 1/2 American and used whole milk instead of 2%. I can't wait to make this again. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Great recipe! Only modification I made was to use 1 1/2 cups of cheese instead and sprinkle some on top for the last 20 or so minutes of baking. Who doesn't love a cheesy baked crust? Next time I'll use a stronger tasting cheese too like a gruyere or at least sharp cheddar. The regular cheddar didntdidn't have a cheesy enough taste. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Tasty. It was easy to make. Make sure to rinse the potatoes. I can see adding things in it like mushrooms or peas etc.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Fantastic!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#3#1#Can I do everything but the baking the day before or will that screw up cheese?
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#This is a great recipe that can be tweaked for your personal taste. I have altered the cheeses and generally add paprika on top.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Tweeked this by adding Mexican cheese mix and smoked paprika....awesome!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#I used a 30 oz bag of hashbrowns, doubled the sauce, don't use more than 1 1/2 tp salt for doubled sauce recipe. Super simple and oh so good!!!! 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Outstanding! I halved this recipe but otherwise stuck to the ingredients and directions. Came out great. I was amazed how such basic ingredients like this could come together so nicely. Highly recommend this!!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Delicious! Only next time I will cut back on the salt by half.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Super easy and oh so delish! If you are pressed for time but need a great side dish try semi boiling your potatoes while making your sauce. Cuts the time down significantly. Also, you can boil your potatoes in chicken broth for extra flavor!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Wonderful. This is the same recipe that my mom and I would make. But we would add pan fried pork chops to it. I would also make a toss green salad to go along with it. YUMMY.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Love this dish! It takes some time but is well worth the effort.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Great recipe Followed the recipe as shown and it was great. Golden brown on top and yummy inside. Will be cooking this again, family loved it.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Great side dish on the holidays , Everyone loves them.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#1#0#I'm eating these potatoes as I'm typing. Cut the recipe in half as it's just my husband and I Taste good. I put less salt in it as the cheese I used was a little salty. Worked out perfectly. In the last 15 minutes of bake time I raised the temperature to 425 degrees. I like my potatoes golden. Then I sprinkled on more cheese, a blend of cheddar and monterey jack, until golden. Think next time I might add some finely diced ham and parsley or sprinkle with crispy crumbled bacon. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Favorite at our home, but I leave the salt to everyone's discretion. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#SALTY! I doubled the recipe and used only 2 teaspoons of salt in total and it was still way too much. These are good but the salt is distracting.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#1#This was good, not great. Omitted the onions and added more cheese and breadcrumbs. It came out a little runny but that could have been my fault as I probably could have left it in the oven longer. Probably will need to tweak a bit more.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#1#Easy & delicious! Prepped night before. Used red potatoes (my favorite). I added bacon for added flavor & a bit more cheese on top. Used corn starch, instead of flour, for gluten-free!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Really quick and easy sauce to make but after an hour had to turn my oven up to 425? to get my potatoes to cook. My husband loved them and I will use this recipe again!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Easy to make and yummy!!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#We enjoyed this recipe. I followed the recipe as written except I added another cup of cheese on top and let them brown. For us it needed a bit more seasoning and onions
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#1#Amazing !!! It's a hit every time. I use almond milk instead of 2 %. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#1#Just made these potatoes last night. Used a little less salt as recommended and used the cheese I had on hand...shredded Colby & Monterey Jack. All other directions I followed as given. The result...the best au gratin potatoes I have ever made or tasted. I never go wrong with a Taste of Home recipe.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#1#Good recipe; can use the cheese mixture on Mac n cheese too. I made mine gluten and lactose free by using gluten free flour mix and lactaid milk and added more butter, melted it and poured some on top with extra cheese before baking. Great left over with eggs..... Garlic and onion powder for extra flavor.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#1#0#These were great. Easy to make and every one enjoyed them. Great recipe.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#1#Perfect. I added about a half tsp of thyme. I also used skim milk because that's what I had, and yellow potatoes instead of russets. Very good. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#1#0#Simple fast and great tasting
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#1#Easy and delicious! Added some bacon for extra flavor. Great recipe...
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#2#0#Enjoyed by all! I had never fixed au gratin potatoes before. This was simple and easy.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#1#These were so easy and delicious. I halved the recipe because there is just hubby & myself. I used part cheddar and part pepper jack because that's what I had in the house. I grated the onion so the flavor would be throughout the dish. Very enjoyable. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Good basic recipe I will tweek this to make it El Paso and Corbell family perfect (for us). Thanks for a great start!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Delicious easy to prepare. I fix this potato dish every couple of weeks . So not to tired of it to soon.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Easy, delicious, and a hit! I added more cheese because... why not!?
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Made these yesterday and followed recipe! Delicious!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Made this for Easter dinner and followed the recipe. Loved it and will definitely make it again.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#1#0#Turns out great every time! I add a pound of sausage for a no-hassle meal that everyone loves!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#1#Enjoyed this recipe. I added bacon and a couple different cheeses. My family loved it.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#1#Loved this recipe! I added diced up garlic also and seasoned with my own lite kick. I also used multiple cheeses. This was my first time making it. It is a keeper!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Excellent! Cut the recipe in half and didn't bake it as long, and it came out terrific! Will definitely make this again. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#this recipe was very easy and looks good. I only changed one thing and that was just using half the salt which happens to be way too much also. you should add salt last, the cheese can have lots of salt and the butter too. It is ruined and will go in the trash and I hate wasting food. sad sad
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Excellent flavor and easy to make. Next time I will diced garlic and jalapeno for added flavor and some Texas kick. Rick
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Wonderful and easy. Doubled the recipe. The best au gratin/scalloped potato recipe I've found. So good that after serving 10 on Christmas Day, I was asked to make it again to go with the left-over ham. For the cheese I used 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar and 1 cup shredded Colby & Montery jack cheese. This is a keeper. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#DELICIOUS!!! Made this as a side dish to our Christmas ham and it was everyone's favorite dish. Perfect recipe! 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#I've looked for years for a recipe that cooks the potatoes completely and now I've found it. Very tasty and quick to put together. Not one complaint or alteration needed:) 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#1#0#First time making this recipe. The neighbors that I shared it with and myself said it was really good. It had good flavor and the potatoes were perfect. I usually share with my friends when trying new recipes. I like the way this recipe is put together.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Divine!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#My family says you knocked it outta the ballpark with this one ! I think that means I'll be buying more potatoes :). Easy to make too (and I'm a novice cook at best)! We truly love this! 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#It is awesome
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Always a big hit in my house!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#dollargirl, how did it go making for 100 people? Very curios, I was thinking about trying it.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#I tried this a couple of weeks ago and my family loved it. I'm going to make it again tomorrow for a crowd of 100 people! Wish me luck! 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#A go-to in my home. Lots of sauce, but I too add an addition potato and it is perfect!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Very good flavor but a bit heavy on the onion. In following the recipe exactly, I felt there was too much sauce, which can easily be remedied by adding another potato or two to soak up more of the sauce. Next time I may add a minced clove of garlic as someone else suggested to see how that tastes as well as cut back a bit on the onion. Otherwise a very good side dish that was fairly easy to make.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Very tasty dish. I added a 4.5 ounce can of mild green chiles to the recipe and it added just the right amount of zip for my families tastes. I also used a combination of red and Yukon gold potatoes, kept the peels on just scrubbed them well and sliced. With the addition of the peels and the chiles it amped up the flavors and the visual appeal as well.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Simple to make, really good. Great basic recipe.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Very tasty,,but next time I will double the sauce to make it creamier. I also added 1/8 tsp. of Thyme to give it extra flavor.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#My very picky husband (who doesn't really like scalloped potatoes) said these are great. Guess all he needed was a little cheese to change his mind! 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#This was great! Even my picky eater husband liked it! I used red and Yukon Gold potatoes and did not peel them. Yum!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#This is the same recipe that I grew up on. The only change I made was using 1 tsp. onion powder instead of the chopped onion (I just added it to the sauce mixture). Still yummy after all these years. A definite keeper!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Love this recipe! I add minced garlic when melting the butter. I've made this 3 times and the last time I doubled everything but the potatoes to make sure it was extra creamy. My family loved it! 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#I love that these potatoes are so creamy and delicious and made with real cheese (not processed cheese food product). I served these for Christmas dinner alongside a prime rib roast. My sister followed me into the kitchen as I cleared the table after dinner, picking the last little bits from the pan. :) They are so good!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#I made a double portion and took to a Christmas dinner. This was a hit! It was easy to make and nothing tricky was involved. Be sure to follow the steps and you won't be sorry! 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#These were so easy to make and so very good! Nice and cheesy. I shredded my own sharp cheddar cheese and the taste was fantastic! This recipe is a keeper!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Excellent, and easy. I like it when I look at a recipe and realize the ingredients are in my kitchen.After taking the cover off, I added a few French fried onions. I will make this again.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#This is exactly what it is supposed to taste like. I've tried several recipes, but I'm done looking. This is the one. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Delicious!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#great au gratin recipe. just like mom used to make. omitted onion & increased potatoes. served alongside ham & havard beets.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Old style simplicity with home comfort taste. My husband and boss were very impressed. Made alongside baked chicken, cooked carrots, and biscuits.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Just an excellent au gratin potatoe recipe!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Very good and easy potatoes. The first time I made they were pretty rich with alot of sauce. The next time I made using about 6 cups of potatoes and they were perfect! I lighten them up with light margarine, skim milk and 2% cheese.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Delicious! I added in thinly sliced kielbasa, green onions, and used garlic salt instead of table salt. I also covered the top with another layer of cheese after the first hour of covered baking, so when it was done there was a nice brown cheesy crust on top. Will definitely make this again.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#This was absolutely delicious!!! Will make again very soon :)
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#very good. I think next time, I will add more pepper, but really really good..
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#These are the best au gratin potatoes I've ever made. Very rich and cheesy, in fact my mom thought I used cream instead of milk. 
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#This recipe is very easy to make. I doubled the cheese, cut the onion in half plus I placed 3 strips of bacon in the bottom of the casserole dish and 4 strips of bacon across the top. My family loved this. I definately be making this again.
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Tastes like my grandmas! Delicious!!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#This was simple and very tasty. I used green onions instead of white. I will make this again!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#Yummy, yummy, yummy. Will make this again and again!
Simple Au Gratin Potatoes#0#0#This is an excellent basic au gratin potato recipe. Because we love cheese so much, I added an extra 1/4 cup or so of grated cheddar.
Bruschetta Chicken#1#0#Where do people add the balsamic? Just as a drizzle once cooked?
Bruschetta Chicken#4#0#OMG! This is good! The only thing I did different was add balsamic vinegar as suggested in other reviews.
Bruschetta Chicken#12#0#Delicious! I did add some balsamic vinegar to the bruschetta on the suggestions of several reviewers, making it more like authentic bruschetta. The only other thing I did differently was to use the bread crumbs to coat the chicken (after the egg dip) rather than to just place it on top of the chicken. I halved the recipe since there was only two of us, but I did make the whole recipe of the bruschetta. I tossed the extra onto some angel hair pasta and it made a nice side for the chicken. Will definitely make again.
Bruschetta Chicken#1#0#I made this recipe this afternoon. Wonderful!!!!! Easy peasy.
Bruschetta Chicken#1#1#I'd prepared this recipe when it first came out in Taste of Home. When I'd prepared it, my changes were: using 1 can (14.5-oz.) diced Italian tomatoes. The chicken was dipped in eggs, then in the flour. Baking time: covered for 20 minutes, uncovered and baked at least 20 to 30 minutes. 
Bruschetta Chicken#4#0#I have made this numerous times, it is absolutely delicious. It tastes like a high calories dish but it is not. I followed pdossantos suggestion, I dipped in flour, eggs then bread crumbs and poured butter over the chicken (the first time I made it I did follow directions exactly) I found this worked better for me. I also used basil paste, found in the produce department. It is on my every two week menu
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Very good!!
Bruschetta Chicken#1#0#Best chicken recipe you've ever made, say my husband and son- both of whom love food! Thanks Taste of Home 
Bruschetta Chicken#1#0#I made this for dinner last night and it was fantastic! The only change I made was using garlic powder instead of fresh cloves since I was too lazy to mess with the fresh stuff. My husband and 2.5 year old devoured it!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I don't know why it has taken me so long to make this delicious entree!!!Very good and a big hit here! 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Very good recipe. Didn't call for anything out of the ordinary. Pretty simple dish to make. 
Bruschetta Chicken#1#0#Excellent and especially good in summer with tomatoes and basil fresh from garden. Fairly quick to make as well. Have made it often. Of course I tweaked the recipe a little to suit my own taste, but know we all do that. Doesn't change the basic recipe which is excellent. 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Very good.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Delicious and flavorful
Bruschetta Chicken#2#0#This was very good. I tweaked it a little in that I tossed the chicken first in the flour, then in the egg mixture, then tossed it in the bread crumb mixture coating the entire piece of chicken instead of just sprinkling the bread crumbs on top. Then I drizzled melted butter over the top of all the chicken. Will definitely make this again!! Thank you.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#This has become one of our families favorite meals. And everyone I have given the recipe to have said it has become one of their favorite ones to make also.
Bruschetta Chicken#1#0#I have made this recipe many times and my family and friends love it. Lots of flavor. I usually use beaten eggs instead of egg beaters.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Very tasty! My husband loved it! Easy to make to
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Made this recipe last evening for dinner. It was delicious! The tomato mixture was delicious. Will definitely make again!
Bruschetta Chicken#1#0#So good!! It will be a do over in our house. Tastes like restaurant quality!!! 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Followed the recipe to a T and it turned out shall we say not so good. It looked nothing like the photo which should have been my first clue when I saw what looked like an omelet under the chicken. Usually you do egg then flour so I dont know if this was the problem or if it was suppose to be like this. Too much basil and garlic for 1/4 c of bread crumbs. Wont be trying this one anymore.
Bruschetta Chicken#2#0#While we made one swap, the bruschetta topping for the chicken was so delicious. The combination of basil, tomato, garlic and cheese is one of our favorites and we adored it on the chicken. We lightened it up by using grilled chicken instead of the breaded. It was VERY, VERY good! We served this with some spaghetti squash and a side salad for a complete, healthy meal.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Wonderful!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#1#Made this Tonight, it was really easy and So Delicious!! Gonna have to Double up next time... Everybody Wanted Seconds. Yes a Wonder tomato topping.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#This was a really easy recipe with tons of yum! I added some garlic powder to the flour to ramp up the flavor. The tomato mixture was delicious!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#My husband and I both loved this, I wouldn't say it's a simple recipe but it is very tasty and uses up tomatoes from the garden it a wonderful way. I did't have fresh basil so substituted 1 tablespoon of dried, very yummy 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#This ones a keeper. I got a lot of praise from the family. Used bruchetta from traders Joe's. Really good 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I used a whole egg since I did not have egg substitute. My kids did hnot like the tomato mixture, but my husband and I enjoyed it all! Would like adding balsamic to it next time as another reviewer suggested.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#My husband and I love bruschetta so trying this recipe was a no-brainer for me. We absolutely LOVED it. I used a whole egg as I didn't have egg substitute. I also added some chopped fresh chives to the fresh tomatoes and just prior to serving also sprinkled with freshly shaved parmesan cheese. This is easy and fast to make but tastes like a million dollars. 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Great dish! I added balsamic to the tomato mixture to make it a true bruschetta.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#My family loved this recipe. Prepared it ahead of time and refrigerated for cooking later that evening. I had never made bruschetta before, but it was not difficult and it tasted delicious. Definitely will make again.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Loved it!! Very easy to prepare. Not much prep time and delicious. Definitely will have it again soon.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#So delicious and easy to prepare! My husband and I both loved it! We let the tomato mixture marinate while the chicken cooked to let the flavors develop, which really added to the dish.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#So delicious. My husband loved it. I didn't have egg substitute so I just used a single egg. The fresh basil is really what makes the flavor amazing in the tomato mixture...I don't think it would taste the same with dried! So glad I bought some fresh because I almost just used what was in my cabinet. Would make this dish for company! 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Wonderful meal!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Delicious!!! I even used drained petite diced canned tomatoes and it came out great.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Nice change. Have made this twice & will make it again.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I've made this twice now and I'd make it right now if I had a ripe tomato. One of hubby's new favorites! 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Great recipe! My husband went nuts!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#It was very easy to make and it was pretty good. felt like it could use some more flavor
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Nice for something different.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#So delicious! Next time I will drizzle some balsamic vinaigrette over the top right before serving to make it even more like bruschetta. My very picky 3 year old even ate the chicken without the tomatoes! I will absolutely make this again!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I didn't have fresh tomatoes I substituted Italian seasoned diced and ti was really good! 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#This is good. Son wasn't thrilled with it, but that's cause he doesn't like tomatoes. 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Quick and easy to fix, and the whole family loved it!
Bruschetta Chicken#1#0#This recipe is fantastic by itself, I have played around with it a little bit and I like adding swiss-american cheese before adding the tomatoes, it melts so well and gives a creamy texture to the dish!! swiss-american cheese can be found at any local grocery store its comes in sandwich squares. another idea is rather then chicken you can to fish, my family likes grouper, rather then coat the whole fish I season it and mix Italian bread crumbs with melted butter and put that mixture only on top of the fish and add the swiss chesse and diced tomatoes from a can that I drain very well, cook it for 8 minutes or so or until it flakes and it turns out fantastic
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I have made this recipe several times and it is one of my favorite chicken recipes. The chicken is so tender and the topping of tomatoes and garlic just makes it taste so good.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Good flavor
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Easy main dish which is light and garden fresh. Will certainly make again!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I thought this tasted great! I'm watching the carbs and it was a great way to omit the bread in traditioanl bruschetta and still get the flavor! 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Loved it! Will definitely make it again!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Very good! Will definitely make again! Tasty and easy to make!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Loved it and I even put on a few balls of fresh Mozzarealla, YUM!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#The crispy texture reminded of fried chicken, but without the guilt! We like our parmesan cheese a bit more than the average person, so we used the large pencil-sharpner-sized pieces of parmesan. What really made this dish appetizing was the way in which the tomatoes were a bit carmelized-this contrasted nicely with the crisp coating. Based on the flavor alone, you would never guess that this would be considered a low-calorie entrée.Submitted by Michel D. Harris, Taste of Home Field Editor
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#What's not to love? I've tried many different variations and it always comes out amazing. I've grilled, fried, and baked it. Once I added some truffle oil...SO good! This recipe is a keeper for sure! 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I loved the bruschetta topping! So good!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#It was a hit in my family!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I just received my TOH magazine on Friday and I couldn't wait to try this recipe. I always see Chicken Bruschetta Grilled not baked. My husband loved it and said fresh tomatoes make all the difference! I used whole wheat bread crumbs to add a little extra fiber. Next time we might kick up the heat with using hot pepper oil instead of olive oil or throw in some hot pepper flake. 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I put the chicken in a brine of salt, garlic and onion powder for a few hours to make the chicken more flavorful and used Panko bread crumbs for more crunch. Very good!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Excellent flavor!! Will definitely make again!!!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Family loved it. Everyone went back for seconds.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Very moist. Made it for company,everyone enjoyed it. Will make again
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#LOVE LOVE LOVE! This is a go-to for dinner guests! My husband will not eat tomatoes, but will eat them in this!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#We loved this tasty and easy recipe. I made a few changes to the original recipe which I would recommend. I added chopped green onions, oregano, parsley and onion powder to the bruschetta as well as more olive oil. When preparing the chicken, I rolled the chicken in the flour, egg and then rolled it in the parmesan and bread crumbs. I baked it uncovered for about 45 minutes. It was so yummy.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I made this for my husband and son tonight exactly as written with the exception of baking about 10 minutes longer to reach the temp of 170º. Well, almost 170º. My guys loved this, we don't even have leftovers! They said it was flavorful and moist. 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#very tasty, quinoa makes a great healthy side dish.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I did the standard flour, then egg, then bread crumb breading routine, and the chicken turned out nice and moist. As for the bruschetta topping, I found the garlic to be a bit overpowering, maybe because it was mostly raw? I did appreciate the fresh tomatoes and basil.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#1#What a simple, yet DELICIOUS recipe. I made it for the first time for guests, and it came out perfectly. Everyone loved it! I do cheat a little bit, and use a jar of Trader Joe's Bruschetta. It's basically the same as the recipe, but done for me, and it's soooo good! In the summer I'll try making my own bruschetta with garden tomatoes, but in the meantime, Trader Joe's helps make this recipe super easy! 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#This dish was just okay for me.Very good if you're looking to cook something on the lighter side. 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#When my other half, who does not like tomatoes, says this is a 5 1/2 star, that says it all.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#A keeper for sure!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Easy recipe with ingredients on hand. I used dried basil and it came out just as tasty! A keeper in this house. Better than eating out!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Given the great reviews and high rating I had great hopes for this recipe. Followed it exactly, and cannot figure out what all the hype is about. Very pedestrian. No one liked it, and all agreed it was missing a lot of something. The chicken was very bland even though I used a very good Parmesan that I grated specifically for this recipe, and added some salt (I season everything) to the flour. The bruschetta on top was just garlicky tomatoes. Definitely deleting this one from the recipes to try file! 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Excellent, restaurant quality meal that the whole family enjoyed. The fresh basil blends so well. I definately will be saving this one. I can't wait to make it again! 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Excellent!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Great recipe. Very easy to make. I loved that I had all the ingredients on hand.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Great receipe...quick and easy to make. I used all fresh ingredients and my family loved it. Very tasty meal.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Loved this recipe! I added some balsamic & it was really made it great!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#My entire family loved this recipe! In addition to the great taste, the best part for me was how easy it is to make and how pretty it looks.
Bruschetta Chicken#1#0#Outstanding! after dipping in egg, I rolled the whole breast in the crumb mixture (which I added garlic & onion powder) - really good!! Will make again... and soon!!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Decided on this recipe because I have an abundance of fresh basil in my garden. I was not disappointed. This is a keeper!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I found that lining the baking pan with non-stick foil made clean up a snap. The bruschetta is so good! Next time I will double the recipe and same some to top off slices of French or Italian bread. I will also try coating the chicken with the bread crumb mixture in a third bowl instead of spooning it on top. Hopefully this will help to make the chicken a bit crunchier. Look forward to making it again for the family.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#This was a very tasty recipe, I didn't have any fresh tomatoes on hand, so I used canned and it worked out just fine. 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#WOW! Just made this for dinner tonight, and my husband and I loved it! It's so easy and works just fine with dried basil. Yummy! 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#This recipe has been around for quite a while. I make it often and love it. It's pretty simple and really yummy. 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#My husband and I love bruschetta so I was anxious to try this recipe. We weren't disappointed! I used dried basil. I also cooked it uncovered for more like 25 minutes because I wanted it nice and crispy. Delicious!!! 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#The smell, the taste.... wow. This recipe was fantastic. I even used the leftover topping on crackers as a snack. Love!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I definitely added a little extra garlic (since I love it!) and i used a can of diced tomatoes which I wouldn't normally do, but fresh tomatoes haven't been looking that great lately. It turned out pretty decent, maybe a little more watery than it would have been with the fresh tomatoes. I definitely plan on trying fresh next time. It wasn't super crispy, but I wasn't really expecting it to be anyways. It was definitely soggy as leftovers, but the flavor was still decent. 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#This is a really tasty, simple recipe that we'll use over and over again. The chicken was tender and flavorful. The dish goes together with little effort, and has a company-worthy presentation. 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#This is a family favorite. I have started putting fresh pesto on the chicken before the tomato mixture....add another level of flavor!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#OMGosh, my teenage sons and I made this recipe with all fresh ingredients. I made 6 breasts in all; one for @ of my 3 sons and one for me. After arguing who was going to get the last two, we cut them in half and @ got an extra half more! The fresh tomatoes, basil and crunchy parmesan were excellent. I know my sons could make this recipe all by themselves, and they probably will! Can't wait for the weather to change so I can start growing basil & tomatoes. YUMMO 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Such a great dish. I do not like fresh tomatoes, but with this dish I was eating every last tomato on my plate, even when there was no chicken left!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Yummo. It's a keeper. 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#DELICIOUS! I have made it a couple of times already, easy to fix, all my family loved it.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#This was a hit with everyone in my family, including the kids!. We used the leftover topping and made regular bruschetta on french bread the next night.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#This recipe was easy to make and pretty good, but just didn't have all that much flavor. I don't think I'd make again. 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#This was super easy to do and the only thing I had to buy was the tomato. I used my fresh basil I had in the freezer so chopped off what I needed. I had company and this was beautiful presentation for dinner. Clean up was a breeze also.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#It was easy to make and really impressed my family
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Wonderful dish, great flavor and pretty enough for company. Although next time I'll only leave it in the oven for a min. or two after adding the tomato mixture instead of 4 min. 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#My family went crazy for the brushchetta taste on top of the chicken and we added egg broad noodles. I added more garlic to the brushchetta because we love it so. This receipe is a keeper for sure. Thanks
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#just made this tonight as I was looking for something to make with my chicken breast. WOW was terrific and soo easy had everything but fresh basil My hubby loved it and said he would eat that again.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#This was SOOOO yummy! My boyfriend is not the biggest fan of tomatoes but he still loved it! I fixed some olive oil pasta to go with and texas cheese toast ... DELICIOUS!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Wonderful. Didn't change a thing. Would definitely serve for company. Easy to make, and a great presentation. 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#O Canada ! !
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I really love this recipe! I added dry basil leaves instead of fresh just because I didnt have it on hand and it was GREAT! Would definetly make it again.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Fabulous! Definitely a recipe to keep for when you are having guests over (impressive presentation). I like to serve it with farfalle pasta. I saute garlic in a pan and toss the pasta in with that, chopped tomatoes, basil, and parmesan cheese. A favorite for sure!!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#This was as tasty as it was easy. The breading on thr chicken also makes great homemade chicken fingers and the bruschetta is great on lots of things, one of my kids liked it so well she put it on her mac and cheese.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Fantastic! Very crunchy and tasty. Kids absolutely devoured it!!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Absolutely will make again! And easy to make.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I did not have fresh tomatoes so I used canned Italian diced and dried basil. I loved it.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I have made this wonderful recipe twice now since I recieved it in a Tate of Home magazine. It was a hit both times! It is moist and super flavorful! It is just as nice to look at as it is to eat. I'm sure I will find myself making it time and time again! Thank you! 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#This was a great new way for us to enjoy chicken! Moist and lots of flavor! I would definately make this dish again.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Yum! easy to make and is a satisfying dinner. I quickly made it on a weeknight too! I love garlic, but my husband would prefer it be cut in half in the recipe. I'd probably consider it in the future, especially when serving it to company. : ) 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Absolutely outstanding, It's all I could think about today 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#This a wonderful dish and very flavorful.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Very good
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Ive had better. The breading was really soggy from the tomatoes. Not bad, but not awesome. Maybe I just made it wrong. probably not a repeater...
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Amazing! I've even taking the topping, mixed it with some mozzerella and used it as a topping for toasted baguette bread. MmmMmmMmm! 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Really good. My family loved it.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#WOW!
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#This was a big hit when i made it for a family gathering. love the garlic/basil/tomato topping. will definatly make it again and again
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Re: Bruschetta ChickenThis is the first time I tried making something for company that I had never made before. Well, It was just wonderful. I served it with smashed potatoes, string beans & a salad. Everyone expressed how delicious it was. Thank you Taste of Home for a great low cost company dinner. Keep them coming.Retired Nana
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I made this chicken dish for dinner the other night and it was an instant hit! Very good flavor and it is ready in no time.
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I only use butter for cooking...and I do leave the foil loose.  I'm wondering if it would be the brand of bread crumbs?  That is the only thing I can think of.  Thanks so much for your response! 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Meesh233-I haven't made this yet, but just a couple of thoughts. Are you using butter with your crumbs-most margarines today contain water which could be causing the soggy problem. Also, you are leaving the foil loose, right so that cooking is aided, but steam escapes? I'm going to try dipping the breast halves in skim milk and then in panko crumbs to see how that turns out. (Panko crumbs are coarser, crisper bread crumbs that allow you to bake things with a crispy coating without frying. It is a newer product here in the US) 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#Can someone help me with this recipe?  I made this a few times and the coating on the chicken will not stay crunchy, it ends up all soggy.   Last year I didn't have this problem, but now I can't seem to get it right again.  Any ideas?  This is such an easy recipe I'm embarrassed to be messing it up.  I bake with foil on for 20, without for 20, and then with the tomatoes only 2-3 minutes to warm them.  Any ideas??  Please?? 
Bruschetta Chicken#0#0#I love this recipe! I make it at least every other week. Simple and tastes great. Wonderful use of garden tomatoes!
Best Ever Potato Soup#2#0#Made this yesterday. If I make it again, I'll leave out the celery seed as it was a bit overpowering. We like potato soup, but hubby didn't eat as much as he usually does, although he never complains. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#6#0#Oh, my goodness. Creamy and comforting! Will make often this winter.
Best Ever Potato Soup#13#30#My family loves potato soup and has been making it for decades. This recipe is similar to how we make ours, with the exception of lots of chopped onion, fresh celery and some chopped fresh spinach. No cheese, but I always add some chicken base and often a sprinkle of bouillon powder. I'm perplexed how so many soup recipes leave those two flavorings out. Maybe because I use homemade bone broth that its needed. But it turns a mediocre soup into fantastic. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#36#63#I made this,.  Therefore, I would not recommend. Then I made it my way. Instead of flour I added an extra cup of potatoes. Then after boiling potatoes in chicken broth, removed a cup of potatoes and mashed them. Returned to pot, added a little cream. and had a deliciously thickened soup. Oh and I never use cheese. It's not needed if you season your potatoes properly.
Best Ever Potato Soup#4#15#I made this . Was not impressed at all. Would not recommend.
Best Ever Potato Soup#9#2#Best potato soup I have ever made! My all time favorite!
Best Ever Potato Soup#16#2#This is amazing! I replaced the Velveeta with some cheddar, and I added some cream, and it tastes phenomenal. Definitely will make again. My friends loved it.
Best Ever Potato Soup#13#2#This is such a comforting soup. I added about 1/4 cup of leeks and substituted the Velveeta with sharp white cheddar cheese. Everything else was kept as is. Delicious.
Best Ever Potato Soup#27#0#Fixed this just as recipe stated, but it was missing something. It tasted fine but just wasn't quite there. Did some research and added a stick of butter.....made all the difference. Now it is a great recipe for me!! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#11#11#Saving this one! My moto is everything is better with bacon and cheddar . Definitely not a fan of Velveeta so I will be switching the cheese out and using fresh celery rather than the celery seed because that has a tendency to be overpowering even with a 1/2 tsp, but everything else will remain the same. We love fresh, hot soups in the winter months and I am always looking for something different than the usual suspects. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#14#1#I've been making this soup since the early 80s. Of course it's better with bacon. My husband likes to top his with a dollop of sour cream. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#20#6#This is an excellent soup. The only changes I made was fresh celery in place of the seeds & sharp cheese in place of Velveeta, my family loved it. Thank you Coleen.
Best Ever Potato Soup#35#18#Turned out great! My husband loved it and I tweaked it a bit....sauteed the onions and carrots in the bacon grease for added flavor, increased the amount of veggies by 25% and the broth by 50%, used half and half instead of milk, used minced celery (had no celery seed and trying to keep sodium low), added a tsp garlic powder, and lastly..... added 1/3 c mozzarella to tone down the velveeta twang. It was so creamy with soft chunks of potato - exceptional flavor (may try without bacon or half and half next time due to heart health issues - any suggestions to replace the bacon?) and it made enough for multiple additional meals which I plan to take the advice from others for various add-ons. Thanks for the recipe!!
Best Ever Potato Soup#38#9#So sorry I have to disagree with a lot of stellar reviews here. The taste of Velveeta is so overwhelming. I will however try again with cheddar.
Best Ever Potato Soup#16#7#This soup is pretty easy and very delicious! I used whole milk since we like our potato soup a little thicker. I also heeded the advice of other commenters and left out the celery seed and use celery salt in place of regular salt. I think I might just add celery to the veggies next time to up the flavor.
Best Ever Potato Soup#22#6#wonderful soup! I used half and half instead of milk and added a dash or two of worcestershire sauce. Also, a can of cream of corn.
Best Ever Potato Soup#18#2#This is the best potato soup recipe I have ever made. It was a hit with the family!
Best Ever Potato Soup#8#0#My all-time favorite soup!!!
Best Ever Potato Soup#14#11#This soup is delicious, but be aware that all the dicing, cubing, peeling, chopping, and grating is very time consuming.
Best Ever Potato Soup#19#2#Easy and delicious! I love this soup because it is great on its own or if you add more to it! I've made it with broccoli and cauliflower. We like to have grilled cheese sandwiches or extra bacon with our soup! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#10#5#My wife and think this is the best soup in my repertoire. We substituted bacon with mutton. Mild cheddar is the closest I could find. It's not rich yet it feels smooth and creamy. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#43#13#This is really good!!! I sautéd the carrots and onions in a bit of the bacon grease for more flavor. I used a bit celery salt and Yukon gold potatoes since that's what I had. I used a very small amount of Velveeta for its creaminess and for the rest I used aged cheddar cheese.
Best Ever Potato Soup#29#2#Best soup!!!! I made a batch and my husband who hates soup even loved it! His only recommendation was next time a double batch!!!
Best Ever Potato Soup#21#3#This really is the best potato soup ever! All I changed was adding more carrots (diced).
Best Ever Potato Soup#6#7#This recipe is almost the same as one i have been using however i use a combination of cream cheese and pepperjack cheese I add fresh diced celery and use celery salt instead of seed the person who said the celery seed was to strong must have used the wrong measurement or celery powder great recipe 
Best Ever Potato Soup#12#7#Fabulous soup! My husband and 9 year-old grandson request this soup often. The only changes I make is to use Better than Bouillon chicken flavor mixed with water rather than broth and Mexican Velveeta cheese. A friend said she combined sweet potatoes and white potatoes in her soup and loved it.
Best Ever Potato Soup#14#0#I am awful at cooking, yet I found this recipe easy despite my challenges as a chef. Loved the flavor, so did my family. I did use the bacon grease that came out the bacon to sauté the onions then add the rest of the veggies.
Best Ever Potato Soup#10#3#This was so much more flavorful than most potato soups I have tried. In fact, I do not usually bother ordering or making potato soup as it is usually pasty and bland. I made as written except used only 1/4 tsp celery seeds. My husband enjoyed it and is looking forward to leftover soup this weekend. Thanks for new take on potato soup.
Best Ever Potato Soup#12#1#I can't believe anyone would think that 1/2 tsp of celery seed would have an overpowering awful taste in a big pot of soup. I thought the soup tasted fine, and could not taste the celery seed. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#5#2#This is such a delicious soup! It's hearty and a crowd pleaser. I also swap out the velvets for shredded cheddar or a mix shredded cheese and use some heavy cream in place for some of the milk.
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#11#So disappointed in this soup! I made this exactly as the recipe read. For my family, the celery seed gave this a bitter, awful taste. So upsetting to try a new recipe, spending time and money, only to be so disappointed!
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#2#Excellent soup. After potatoes were cooked I mashed them a little before adding the cheese. Used a tex mex mix and some mozzarella. I had some left over peas and corn (half a cup). Through them in at the end. Very good. Love this soup.
Best Ever Potato Soup#16#2#I was a bit nervous to make this soup because of the simple ingredients and simplicity of making it. I'm sure glad it took the chance because my family and I loved it!. Definitely a hit and will absolutely make this again. If you're not sure about this soup...take that chance. It will be worth it! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#11#1#This is so good. My husband and I both say it is the best soup I have ever made and I made no changes to the recipe.
Best Ever Potato Soup#3#1#Best potato soap
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#1#How much cheese is to be added in? The recipe doesn't say. I played with the amount myself. Very good tho!
Best Ever Potato Soup#3#0#Very easy and delicious. My family fought over the small amount of leftovers the next day!
Best Ever Potato Soup#10#2#Novice here! What potato do you use for soup?
Best Ever Potato Soup#2#2#thank you for this recipe. I was surprised to see a recipe in Taste of Home from some one in Sweet Valley PA. I lived there from 1960 to 1963 and graduated from Lake Lehman High School. It is my most favorite place I have ever lived.
Best Ever Potato Soup#5#1#With the cooler air coming in our son was asking for soup, this recipe did not disappoint! It hit the spot , very easy to make with great flavor!
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#2#I will definitely rated a10 it's similar to My Mom Recipe she put 1/2 Cheddar Then 1/2 white cheddar omg it is so good on a cold day , Bread Choice was 2 my family wanted cornbread , & my mom I wanted a good crust French bread toasted.
Best Ever Potato Soup#2#0#This is good recipe , I prepared it last night
Best Ever Potato Soup#6#6#this is mostly my favorite recipe in the entire world (i made an account just to rate it) but i need to know what on god's green earth made you use velveeta instead of just normal cheese 
Best Ever Potato Soup#8#1#Love this recipe! I make it often as it's become my new comfort food. The only tweaks I made to it are: - No Carrots: They make the soup too sweet. - Cheese: I prefer using real cheese like medium cheddar or colby rather than the Velveeta. It melts fast if you shred it. On occasion I'll use 1/2 (or less) of the Velveeta and substitute the other half with actual cheddar or colby. Real cheese will always taste better. - On occasion I'll use broccoli instead of potatoes - viola you have broccoli cheese soup! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Good one
Best Ever Potato Soup#2#2#I didn't have any celery seed to use and I swapped out Velveeta for freshly-grated sharp cheddar and mozzarella. Put a dash of white wine in, only used 3 strips of bacon instead of 6, and used about a half cup of heavy cream and 2 cups of milk, but other than that, I followed the recipe. It turned out absolutely DELICIOUS! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#0#I would cut the amount of onions down a bit if your not a big fan, and double/triple the amount of salt and pepper, and if you're looking for just a bit more of a spicy and creaminess I would add 1-2 cups of Perpper Jack and Colby jack (less than half a cup of Colby 
Best Ever Potato Soup#2#0#I'd made this recipe and the only ingredient not used were the green onions. Everything else was kept as recipe directed! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#to finish my review ( it always gets cut in half)
Best Ever Potato Soup#2#0#Love this soup! It's fabulous with bacon OR ham.... I used cheddar instead of velvets.
Best Ever Potato Soup#4#0#This was a delicious and satisfying soup. The only thing I did differently was to thicken it with potato flakes instead of flour. I think you could use whatever cheese your family likes to eat and it would be just as great. It's a keeper.
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#24#Just looking at the length of ingredients turns me off, and so does the bacon. Processed cheese food? That's not even real cheese. I have a potato soup recipe that uses Colby Longhorn. Short, simple and always gone as soon as it's ready. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#3#1#This soup is amazing and super easy! I suggest prepping/cutting everything first and then begin the cooking. I made it my own by using 2 stalks of fresh celery instead of celery seed, adding some butter at the end, using fresh sharp cheddar instead of velveeta, added fresh garlic, and added the onion to the cooking bacon about 5 minutes in, cooking for a while longer, then draining to really add a deep flavor. I also sprinkled with paprika at the end- amazing!
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#1#Wow! Just delicious! Used cheddar instead of Velveeta, added a dash or two of Worcestershire sauce and some garlic powder. Cooked the onion in the bacon grease. Next time, will add a can of cream of corn.
Best Ever Potato Soup#2#0#This is delicious and incredibly easy! Definitely adding this to the rotation. Followed the recipe exactly, except we didn't have any celery seed so I omitted that. Still turned out fab! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#0#I made this the other night. It is so good. I highly recommend it. Even my husband loved it. I use half and half instead of milk, makes it more creamy. I just followed the recipe.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#This is absolutely fabuloso, followed recipe as written yummm
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#1#I have made this soup three times and it is so tasty! Have gotten many compliments. The first two times I used half and half instead of milk. Delicious both ways. The bacon really adds flavor.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Omg simply amazing I used 2 cups heavy creamy little milk and....BAM---I kicked it up a notch!!!! Ty very good will tell every one
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Easy to make and delicious! Definitely a keeper.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#9#This is a very good Potato Soup Recipe, but not a Pennsylvania Dutch Recipe. (That's the reason for the average rating.) Pennsylvania Dutch cooking doesn't have many ingredients. Potatoes, milk or cream, celery, salt and pepper. For protein, sliced hard boiled eggs are the topper. Eggs and potatoes were abundant in the area 
Best Ever Potato Soup#3#0#2 giant thumbs up! made this for super bowl Sunday and it was a huge hit! changed the recipe a bit to make more than the recipe made and it was awesome! definitely a redo recipe!! I used about 4.5 cups of potato cubes and made more cream sauce using 4 cups of milk and 4 tablespoons of flour. I am not a big soup person but this will show up on my table many more times!!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#22#I can't see a reason for adding milk to a hearty soup, I hate milky soups 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#14#https://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/perfect-potato-soup/ This ?? This is the best potato soup ever. No need for processed velveeta here, the flavor and texture is incredible. I always make the pioneer woman potato soup recipe.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Love potatoes-will try to get it made at home or will try it at a good restaurant.-lovely,yummy
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#0#This was very, very good. Made it just as recipe stated. Will definitely save! Thank you for sharing.
Best Ever Potato Soup#3#1#The name says it all - we had a luncheon at our house and 6 of the 6 people said the soup was delicious. One of the men asked me to give his wife the recipe
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#0#So good!!! My husband and daughter love this. We like to add a few more potatoes and water. Yum!!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Good potato soup! I typically do not prefer cheesy soups but the cheese was barely noticeable.
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#0#Very good potato soup. Husband kept saying'this is so good'. Glad I doubled the recipe, will print this one. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Very good taste and easy to make. However it wasn't quite the consistency it should have been for potato soup, even though I added extra flour. When I reheated it, the potatoes turned mushy.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Awesome soup!! We love time!
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#0#Nothing but praise from my guests. Definitely a recipe that you need to double if you want any leftovers for yourself!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Delicious!! I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and it was the perfect amount for our evening meal along with a warm bun. I did use sharp cheddar just as a preference.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Absolutely perfect! I've made this countless times and it is always a hit, especially on cold winter nights. It doesn't take that long to make it and there are a few hacks to making it even quicker. I've used bacon pieces and frozen cubed potatoes before and it still turned out good! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#5#1#Absolutely delicious! I definitely recommend doubling the recipe if you are making this for a family, so you can enjoy leftovers! The few changes I made: I used Sargento sharp cheddar cheese instead of processed. There was no graininess in the texture, which sometimes can happen with pre-shredded cheese. I am not an expert cook by any means, but I was a little thrown off by the milk/flour mixture. I am used to making a roux, so that is what I did instead. To the roux, I added half and half (instead of milk) and the cheese. I then poured this mixture into the pot with the veggies/broth. I didn't think this recipe needed any salt, so I didn't add any. I topped each bowl with shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and some green onions. So, so, good! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#3#1#I highly recommend you cook your bacon strips first before dicing them. Once they're crispy they're much easier to cut. Also I don't recommend the flour step, so far all potato soup I've made has had the perfect consistency with just the potatoes getting a little mashed and the cheese doing its own thing.Also as others suggested, I recommend cutting the cheese back a touch. Velveeta is already very thick and provides a lot of its own unique flavor. I went majority cheddar cheese and about a five ounce block of velveeta.And, as a presence, I added some green onion into the soup verses on top. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Just as good as restaurant Potato soup! I did not have any parsley so omitted and no celery seed so added celery salt. After cooking on stove used my pressure cooker simmer for 1 hour. It was the best. I did only use half the amount of velveeta however I thought it might me to cheesy so that was perfect.
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#5#There is no reason to add flour to potato soup. It will give the soup an artificial starchy taste. Simply use an immersion blender and puree the the soup when the potatoes are cooked. And, use REAL cheese!
Best Ever Potato Soup#2#1#I prepared as directed. It was a very heavy, rich, and filling soup. I think if I make it again I would use a different cheese. I wasn't a fan of the velveeta flavor. It looked beautiful and my family liked it. I thought it was just okay, but I'll try it again maybe with cheddar or Colby cheddar mix. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Great...try adding a tad (2 tsp) fresh dill....adds an additional depth.
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#0#I have made many versions of potato soup, and this one is truly one of the best ever! This will definitely be on my winter soup list to make on a regular basis. I think it would also be great with leftover baked ham instead of bacon!
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#0#Made it this evening. Tastes very good. Shared with neighbors and they wanted recipe. Very filling.
Best Ever Potato Soup#2#2#Just prepared this tonight for the first time and it did not disappoint. Only change was to use whole milk and shredded mild Colby instead of velveeta. This soup was wonderful on a very cold Ohio night. Being someone who loves potato soup, I have to say this is one of the very best potato soup recipes and one I will be making over and over again.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Yummy soup and easy to make. I have made this twice in the last week. I just used grated cheddar cheese and I did not have any green onions, otherwise I made it just as it says.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#This is a very good recipe. I have a similar recipe but without the bacon and it is just as good. It didn't get as thick as I had assumed it would. Not sure what happened. I even added more like 4-5 T. flour. HMMMM???? 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Just had this tonight. This is one of the best potato soups I've ever had. Very filling and can also freeze for later. A real keeper. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#This was awesome! Very easy and delicious. We would double the recipe, if we had our boys home from college.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Great flavor! Once I gathered everything, this came together really quickly. I would definitely make this for company. I might try to swap out the velveeta for a white cheddar, but as is it's very good! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Delicious! I doubled the recipe and served in sour dough bowls! Easy and perfect for an Autumn lunch!!!!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Never was happy with other recipes and then my daughter came across this one and told me to try it. It will be the only one I ever use again.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Made this for my family and they all loved it. I personally would add more potatoes and slightly more seasoning but other than that this recipe is simple but delicious. My family said it was better than Logan's (a restaurant). 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Awesome! Made no changes except added bacon at the end. My husband raved about it almost every bite. Next time i will double it so we have leftovers. This one is a keeper
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#5#I have yet to taste this creation but I'm giving it 5 stars nevertheless. I made a couple of modifications. I added all the bacon grease from the pound of bacon I cooked and crumbled. I also added a packet of Ranch seasoning. This makes my potato salad do delicious so thought I'd try it. I'm also adding some fresh parsley at the end and adding sharp cheddar cheese instead of the velveeta. This is for a soup off at school tomorrow. I can't wait to see if it's one of the winners. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Very good. Yummmm 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Cooked slices of Bacon disappears at my house, so I sauteed Double the onions and carrots in bacon grease. Added 32 oz of chicken broth. Doubled spices and potatoes. Kept the milk, flour and velveeta as called in recipe. Sprinkled bacon bits in each bowl. Amazing!!!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#A LNG-time family favorite! I've made this many times, with and without the bacon. It's great both ways. Nothing better on a cold winter day. My husband says he'd pay for this soup! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#This is awesome! I may add a little cayenne to kick it up a notch, but really good just the way it is.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#I added a bit more carrot and used Kraft Cheddar Cheese blend with Philadelphia Cream Cheese in it. It was very very good and extremely simple. I also used fresh parsley. It was a hit with all my family. My grandma and my stepmom both asked for my recipe!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Wonderful soup, creamy and delicious. I used shredded TexMex cheese instead of Velveeta for a bit of kick and added garlic powder with the spices. It's a keeper. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#This is a very easily assembled soup and it's delicious. I put a little less bacon and little less Velveeta but it was still wonderful! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#This was really good! Super cheesy though, kinda tasted like au gratin potatoes. My husband loves Velveeta so he gobbled it up. I put in diced ham instead of bacon because it's what I had on hand. Will definitely make it again. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#I added more pepper and used shredded cheese. And I threw all in the crock pot. Super easy and very good. Would make again.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#1#Awesome soup, thumbs up 5 stars.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Simply amazing
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#We liked this soup, it had a good start to the flavor. I did add more salt and pepper than was called for. I made few other changes too: I sauteed the chopped onion in some of the bacon fat before I added the chicken broth; I heated up the milk before adding it to the hot broth and potatoes (so it wouldn't curdle when added); finally, I pureed the soup before adding the cheese. It came out very creamy and smooth that way! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#This was an ausume soup
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#I used heavy cream in place of 2% milk. I also added 3 cubed hard boiled eggs after the potatoes were cooked. That's how we Pennsylvania German people make it. I'm thinking a non-processed cheese might be better. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Delicious! I do a few things different when I make it -- after frying the bacon, I remove it with a slotted spoon and sauté the onion and a few cloves of garlic for a few minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. I also left out the celery seed and added some garlic powder instead -- my husband and I love garlic!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#We loved this recipe. The only thing we added was garlic. both of my picky sons ate it all!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Best ever
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#The only thing I changed was I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of the Velveeta cheese. Turned out great.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Made this recipe according to the directions and it turned out perfect and delicious.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#YUMMY,This turns out perfect every time I make it
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Yum!! Just made this soup using frozen hashbrowns and it turned out delicious! I used a little less bacon, around 3 cups or more frozen hashbrowns, and shredded cheddar cheese instead of velveta. I used fat-free milk and added a touch extra salt after tasting it when it was done. Didn't have fresh onions on hand, so used 2 Tbsp hydrated onion. This will be on my list of great soups for fall! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#I added hot sausage meatballs too!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Love ths recipe, I added heavy cream instead of milk and a little minced garlic. I used cheddar instead of Velveta. My family loved it. Definately a HIT!!!!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#My family loves this soup. Get lots of raves when I make it.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#I have been making this recipe forever and we all love it. I also add some chopped celery and a tad of minced garlic as well. Great hearty soup!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#I have been making this recipe for YEARS - it's our favorite soup, comes together in no time and is just wonderful!! I double the veggies and also add celery to it. YUMMO. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#I tweeked this recipe a little bit. I doubled it for starters. I also used 4 stalks of fresh celery and sauteed the celery, onions, and carrots in bacon drippings in the stew pot. I also used 8 oz of velveeta and 8 oz of sharp cheddar cheese. Of course I also doubled the bacon. :) This recipe was a HIT! I shared with a family of four - single dad and three picky eating kids..they devoured it. I will hands down make this again. We ate it with Rhodes frozen rolls :) mmmmmm!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#I added a rib of celery and used half the amount of velveeta. I added 4 oz shredded sharp cheddar for more authentic cheese flavor. I had fresh parsley on hand, so I used that instead of dried. I think a garnish of chives would be even better than green onions.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Too easy..too delicious...to die for. The next go round i'd like to add brocolli. I lowered the fat content by using skim milk. I even sprinkled some shredded provolone and chedder. Total comfort food. THANK YOU COLEEN MORRISSEY! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#This IS the best potato soup ever, a family favorite!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#This is the best potato soup I have ever had and a staple recipe for me!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Yes! Best ever potato soup!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Wow, very tasty! But I always very carefull with Velveeta so I put less amount of it because I am always afraid to get very cheesy.
Best Ever Potato Soup#2#0#I usually love potato soup but my husband (who loves this recipe) made this for us twice and both times I thought it tasted just awful! I'm not sure if it was the processed cheese or if the potatoes were just too starchy...I know he would give this a 5 star rating but I guess not everyone has the same tastebuds! :) 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#This was delicious. I added some of the bacon grease to the initial broth and used an 8 oz bag of shredded sharp cheddar for the cheese. I excluded the carrot and green onions. Will definitely make this again.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#this recipe is so good. It is very easy to make. I added more bacon and cheese and it was more of a cheese soup rather than more of a potato soup. Excellent!! Seriously is the best potato soup ever
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Simple and quick to make. Of course more bacon is always better! I'm going to try half beef broth half chicken broth next time. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#YUM!! So good and easy.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Outstanding recipe! I just made this for dinner. We loved it and agree that it is a keeper. I did not dice the bacon. I cooked it until crisp. I crumbled half of it and added to the pot with the potatoes and broth. We used the remaining to crumble into our bowls. I sauted the onions and carrots in about a tbs of bacon drippings before I added the potatoes and broth. I used celery seed because I did not have fresh celery, but I plan to use fresh celery next time. Also, to increase volume, used 4 cups and milk and a little more than 4 tbs. flour. My husband likes his soup a little thick. This recipe is very versatile. I am already planning when I can make this again, and maybe use ham instead of bacon. Another great recipe for my collection!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Delicious - perfect for those sick, rainy days!! :) will make again soon!!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#My family loves this! Best potato soup ever!
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#0#I've scoured the internet, looking for the perfect potato soup recipe - this is it! Very good flavor and consistency. I'll definitely make this recipe again and again. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Very good recipe. I used a bag of diced potatoes to cut down on prep time. I didn't have any celery seed so left it out. It was still great! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Very good ..kids inhaled it!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#1#I make a batch of soup every week and this is quickly got worked into the rotation. It's very easy & very good. I follow the directions exactly and I always double it. Everyone loves this soup. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Served this at my St. Paddy's theme dinner and it was very good!! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Wow! Best-Ever is an understatement! I researched many different recipes before finding this one and I will look no more. I made some changes but am sure the original recipe is just as good. I reserved a few tablespoons of bacon grease and sauteed finely chopped onion, garlic and three celery stalks until tender. I used reduced sodium broth and bacon and increased amount of salt to 1 rounded tsp. I also reserved some of the bacon for garnish with shredded cheese. I used 1 can evaporated milk and half-half to equal 2 cups and then used 1 cup 1% milk to equal the 3 cups recipe calls for. I purchased cream of potato in case i needed to thicken but no thickening needed. It was so creamy and literally hugged the spoon, I think the evaporated milk helped. Next time I will add another cup of potatoes. Thanks so much for the recipe! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#This is delicious and easy to make potato soup. I didn't have celery seed so I chopped up a couple stalks of celery. I also added minced garlic which I put in almost everything I cook. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Made this soup today since hubby is under the weather. This soup was excellent! I did make a few changes. First, I doubled the recipe to make a nice size pot. I omitted the celery seed as DH does not like it, but I minced a small rib of celery and cooked it with the potatoes and other veggies. Instead of doubling the parsley flakes, I added 1Tbsp. dried parsley flakes and 1 Tbsp dried minced chives. I added equal amounts of melted margarine with the flour in a separate pot, then added the milk and cheese to make a cheese sauce. Once that was all thickened and cheesy, I added it to the potato/veggie mixture. It was great, and I will make it again!
Best Ever Potato Soup#1#0#This is a delicious potato soup. If you like clam chowder...adding clams to this would be delicious as well. I've made this soup several times. VERY GOOD! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Excellent recipe! I've tried several other potato soup recipes which we like but both my sons said this one was the best and asked me to make again! My husband liked it as well but thought I should reduce the salt a little bit. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#I made this soup tonight and I would defiantly make it again. It was super easy, I didn't grate my carrots I just sliced them real small and it worked just fine. Sharing this with all of my friends. 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#This really is the BEST potato soup ever! Everyone who I have shared it with LOVES it. I make it several times during the winter. I won't even ever try another potato soup recipe now! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#I made this soup tonight for my family. I used pkg shredded cheese instead of velveeta. And took the bacon out of pan after I cooked it. And served it on top of soup as a garnish. Everyone loved it. This is a keeper. Thank you for the receipe.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#It really is the Best! I added some Johnsonville Hot Italian sausages instead of the bacon--tasted just like the potato soup at the Olive Garden! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#This is the BEST soup I have ever made. I will be making it ALL THE TIME and the recipe will be going out to all my friends!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Got this from a dear friend. We each have 6 kids. So there are 16 of us total when we are together. Everyone of us LOVE it! That is pretty good pleasing all 12 kids at once. I added leftover spiral cut ham and it was delicious! Love this recipe! And super easy and quick for our large family!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#This was my first time making potato soup. What a great recipe! I had smoked sausage in the freezer, so I used that instead of bacon. Gave the soup a smoky nice flavor. I had extras so I froze some and reheated later and it was just as good. This is a winner.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#This is the first time I've made potato soup. I searched for recipes here and chose 3. I finally decided to try this one to take to work for a birthday lunch (we have one every month). Everybody LOVED it!! Thanks Coleen and Taste of Home!! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#I have made potatoe soup for years. this is by far the best
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Found this recipe years ago in a Taste of Home cookbook and became a family favorite. I sometimes sub diced smoked sausage for the bacon and it's insanely decadent! 
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#This was a hit with my family! I will make this again!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#Loved this recipe!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#My family loved this, especially my husband who is kinda picky!!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#This was very good.
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0# Sounds good to me too, but I would sub real bacon bits for the bacon. Love, potato soup!!!!!!!!!
Best Ever Potato Soup#0#0#I made this yesterday and loved it. Thanks.Aleida
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This gluten free banana bread was fantastic.   I used the cup for cup King Arthur flour.   I  added cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.  I didn't have any walnuts, but I did have chopped pecans, and they were wonderful.   It came out moist and flavorful. MY gluten tolerant family loves this bread too! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#1#Excellent recipe and versatile. 4 eggs seemed like a lot but was needed for structure and did not taste eggy . I used Premium Gold whole grain flour with brown rice, quinoa, buckwheat and flax and also 1/2 c oat flour. 1 t. b. soda and 2 t. cream of tartar for leavening. 2T butter and double the vanilla. A few craisins. 1/4 c. brown sugar. Otherwise as directed. If you ended up with a heavy loaf, try a smaller pan or muffins. My muffins, 5x8 and 3x5 pans all rose nicely and did not fall. Moist but not heavy or Gluey. I am impressed. Nice flavor too. thanks! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#3#1#This is my first review on here. I loved this gluten free bread! For the past year I've been reading recipes on here and reading comments from reviewers on recipes I'd like to try. I find the comments invaluable. I used 5 very ripe medium to large bananas, and I replaced the oil in this recipe with 1/2 cup butter. Added cinnamon and allspice. Doubled the vanilla extract!! I didn't have applesauce on hand but did have apple butter like another reviewer had suggested. I used one cup Namaste and 1 cup Bob Red Mill 1 to 1 gluten free flours. The batter was thin enough to pour into my bread pans and it baked perfectly at 55 minutes for me. There is no way you could tell this is gluten free! I like this better than regular banana bread which I've found can be dry at times. Not this one!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#4#0#Made this for the first time today, followed the recipe exactly ! Delicious, moist, perfect! ?????? I will definitely make it again.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I love it's 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#17#1#I've been baking this every week since finding the recipe and everyone I've given it to has raved. I modified it a little in that I add 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and a pinch of cloves. I use an all-in-one GF product which tends to yield a product which is a bit too heavy and doesn't rise as well as with regular wheat flour. The 1/2 tsp of baking powder makes a big difference, and the small amounts of spices bring out the richness of flavor. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#5#0#Very moist and light. Cake-like, not dense like the usual banana bread. I had to bake for the full 55 min.to get it to spring back in the center.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#8#0#I make this bread at least once a week, sometimes more. My son can't have dairy or gluten, so this is perfect. I will sometimes add dairy-free chocolate chips. I also don't always make it into loaves. It bakes great in a 9x13 pan and the extra batter I use for muffins. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Is a very tasty moist banana bread.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#2#1#I just made this but with almond flour. I have a mess. The batter turned out very coarse. Help.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Wow this is such an easy recipe to follow....the bread is great as we made it as written. I will make this over and over again. The only thing I added was Chocolate chips instead of nuts (As I had no nuts).
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#2#0#used 1/2 cup of coconut sugar instead of 1 cup. this was really delicious. it made 1 loaf and 12 muffins. i sprinkled the muffins with chocolate chips. They were a winner.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#1#0#Loved this recipe! I used olive oil instead of canola oil. Instead of sugar I used about 2/3 c maple syrup. Seemed a little soupy so I added an extra 1/2 cup GF flour. My blend of GF flour is brown rice flour, potato starch and tapioca flour so I added 3/4 teaspoon xantham gum. Wasn't too sweet either. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#1#0#Excellent recipe. Made just a few adjustments, didn't add all the sugar (the bananas I had were really sweet) Added some butter, made cake more moist. Perfect recipe.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I just made this. I replaced the sugar with 1/3 c of Pyure stevia & I used 2c of bobs red mill gluten free 1 to 1 baking flour and I substituted the canola oil with vegetable oil. It tastes wonderful. You can't taste any difference between the gluten free and regular banana bread. It doesn't rise as high but it's very light and moist. Only had to bake for 45 min. Please try it, you will be so happy you did.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#4#I had to bake for 15 minutes longer than the directions and still it was not fully cooked. This recipe is the worst gluten free banana bread recipe I have ever cooked. I have made so many different gluten free recipies and they were all pretty much fantastic, I didn't relize it was possible to be this heavy gooey mess. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This is the best gluten free bread I have ever had. I did tweak the recipe slightly:1. egg whites only2. added 1 tsp of baking powder3. no sugar or sweetener - it took about 7 bananas to make 2 cups (organic, tree ripened)4. olive oil instead of canola5. added cinnamon6. didn't add any nuts but would have been lovely 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Seem to be making this on a weekly basis for months now. Wonderfully moist. I do add cinnamon.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#1#0#WOW!! Very moist, very flavorful and so easy to make. You can definitely make just as the recipe reads or change it up. I added only 1/2 cup sugar but sprinkled some cinnamon and sugar on the top before baking. It was plenty sweet! I received praise from two co-workers who are gluten free and this is the best compliment.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#1#I love this recipe because we all have most of the ingredients or substitutions at home. I used a coconut flour (Mama's Coconut blend gluten free flour found at tj maxx) so to complement this I used coconut oil and a few flakes of unsweetened coconut on top with pecans. I had a guest staying at my house that was gluten free but all the other guests said they couldn't tell the difference and gobbled up the bread then asked to take the muffens home! I made one loaf and 8 muffins with this recipe. Fabulous! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Awesome recipe thank you! First great tasting bread!Substituted applesauce with blended blueberries, used a tablespoon of two less of sugar and added a couple handfuls of blueberries and walnuts. YUMMY! ??????
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I loved the way this recipe came out. My friend sent it me because she wanted to try a GF recipe, so I figured I'd check it out as well. I substituted Olive Oil for Canola Oil because I didn't have Canola Oil. Also, I used a half cup of sugar, and added chocolate chips. For this recipe, I made muffins instead of a loaf, and for that I baked the muffins for 30 minutes, which was a perfect amount of time for them. The end result was very moist, and delicious muffins. It made 12 muffins (I filled the cups almost to the top, so they were quite full).. I usually cut the sugar on recipes, especially when they call for one cup (it just seems excessive). I considered using honey as a substitute for the sugar, and may try the recipe again doing just that. I think what helps this recipe stay so moist is adding the apple sauce.TL:DR - Recipe was delicious! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This was delicious!! I made two slight changes: I used 1 cup of apple sauce and I changed the oil to coconut oil instead. I LOVE this recipe. I have tried hundreds of gluten free banana bread recipes and this one is the best. I am sorry some had a hard time with the recipe because this banana bread is top notch!!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#1#0#For some reason, it wouldn't let me rate this recipe 5 stars. (Only would let me rate 4.5, but it is a five star) This is a delicious, moist and tasty recipe as is. Very difficult to find a gluten free banana bread recipe that creates a very moist, tasty outcome. Easy to make and very flavorful. I love that it makes two loaves and you don't need to put butter on the finished product for more moisture. I would like to try some other alterations like coconut oil, yogurt option, brown sugar or honey, (less sugar) options as healthier choices. But, it's a must try recipe. You won't be disappointed especially if you use 5 overripe bananas and follow recipe as is. Thank you for sharing. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#1#1#I cannot recommend this recipe enough! I've been into baking for years, since before I found out that I was gluten intolerant, and it's been hard to find a banana bread recipe that isn't too dense or too try. This is the one! After reading the comments, I made the following substitutions, which yielded an incredibly moist and flavorful banana bread:- 3/4 brown sugar; a good squirt of honey (instead of 1 c sugar)- 1/2 c plain greek yogurt (instead of 1/2 c applesauce)- 1/3 c coconut oil (instead of canola)- omitted nuts and added coconutMade 2 mini muffin tins and one loaf 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I tried this recipe after reading a few of the other reviews, so I had an idea of some additions I would make to the recipe. I doubled the applesauce amount to 1 cup and added 3 more extra ripe bananas. I also added 1/4 tsp black walnut extract instead of actually using walnuts because we have a toddler who isn't eating nuts yet. I also added approximately 4 teaspoons cinnamon sugar. The result was a very moist, incredibly tasty banana bread loaf! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#2#I seriously do not know how this recipe got 5 stars, I picked it b/c of its high rating. This is quite possibly one of the most awful banana bread recipes I have ever tried. It was dry, crusty, tasted like cardboard...I do not know how it's possible to make banana bread not even taste like banana bread but this recipe managed to make that happen. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This bread has passed it's first day taste test. If it retains the moisture, it's a good gluten-free version. I did add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 3/4 cup chocolate chips. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I made the bread following the directions. The bread turned out well, light and with a nice height. However, it tasted very bland to me. Wish I had added some cinnamon or nutmeg to give it some spunk!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This recipe is great! I just changed up a couple of things because I wanted to substitute the sugar and oils with something more healthy. The bread was more moist than I have ever had in any banana bread! So I used honey and coconut oil instead of sugar and canola oil. I also added way more applesauce than is called for. Banana bread should be more of the consistency of something you can pour out into a baking pan. Initially the batter was too thick to pour out but as I added applesauce, it became pourable and spreadable. Otherwise I really like the recipe and I only added walnuts, not chocolate just walnuts and it was refreshingly not too sweet but just right and like I said really moist! Delicious!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I recently found out that I am sensitive to gluten and wanted to make a banana bread. After reading the reviews, I decided to make this one and it was pretty good. The only changes I made to the recipe was I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 cup of white sugar and I used pecans instead of walnuts. It wasn't the best banana bread I've had but it was pretty good. I'm going to make it one more time following the recipe exactly and see if it comes out better. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#1#Not certain what others have done that I have not but this was the most useless recipe I have ever utilized. Too thick, burns on top and sides and raw in the middle, I even tried adding more applesauce so it would not be like cooking wallpaper paste. In the trash it went and going back to my old recipe.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#only have sweetened applesauce, how would I adjust recipe to use it?
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I like to wait until I have made a recipe at least 3-4 times before I leave a review. I have made this banana bread recipe over a dozen times. It is excellent. Absolutely perfect (however, I reduce the sugar or else it tastes more like candy than bread). It is absolutely indistinguishable from wheat banana bread, and actually, I think a lot better tasting. Thank you very much for this keeper!!!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#this is the best bread ever :)!!!!!!!! very fluffy
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I am amazed. I have experimented with many banana bread recipes and this one is by far the best.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#We were totally impressed with this GF banana bread recipe. It is almost impossible to get a soft, non crumbly bread recipe using GF flour. This one is superb! I did not have any applesauce so I used same amount of apple butter in place of applesauce. Delicious! Thank you so much for this recipe Five Stars for sure
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Just made this following the recipe with no modifications. The bread is awesome. Could not tell that it was gf. Next time I plan to substitute part of the sugar for stevia.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Absolutely delicious. Followed the recipe to the letter. Awesome!!!!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Really enjoyed it! I didn't have apple sauce so I used greek yogurt and extra vanilla. Still turned out great! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Excellent recipe - tastes great! We did make a couple changes to accommodate our ingredients and our taste. We had homemade sweetened applesauce, so we cut the amount of sure in half. We doubled the vanilla because we like vanilla. No nuts this time. Perhaps next time we will add in dried cranberries or raisins.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Both my fiancee, and her friend, both raved about this banana bread recipe! My fiancee has Celiac, and her friend (who doesn't have it), said it's the best banana bread they've ever tried! Not only that, they couldn't believe it was gluten free! Thank you, Taste of Home! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Excellent recipe. I increased oil to half cup because I had no applesauce. Of course it would be healthier with the applesauce!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This is a GREAT recipe. I own a B&B so occasionally I need to come up with something for GF guests and this particular guest is also dairy free, so this recipe was exactly what I needed. I made 1/4 of the recipe and baked it as muffins and it was absolutely fabulous. only took 15 minutes to bake small muffins and reduced the oven temp to 325. I probably used a little extra apple sauce (made it myself with sliced apples and oil and cooked till soft) and not quite enuf bananas. ANd I had my doubts with it being as wet as it was when it went into the oven, but they rose nicely and browned and were a HIT. She ate 3 muffins and all week had not been eating much of anything I had made!!! THANK YOUand I left out the nuts but I'm sure that would have been fine. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Didn't hurt to double nuts (I used pecans) and also added 1/2 cup crasins. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Holy gluten-free deliciousness! This recipe was so easy and honestly just amazing! My baking time was a bit less than what was recommended (mine were done in about 40min not 45-55min), but wow it knocked my socks off. If you LOVE banana bread and have a gluten allergy (or celiac like myself), you will not feel slighted by this recipe. I used Pamela's Baking/Pancake (GF) flour and it made this a superb recipe! It's already a family favorite and will be a recipe I use year after year. :) 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Best bananna bread ever! I had never made gluten free anything, and this turned out so well! I did make a couple of changes so that didn't have to use sugar:-I omitted the sugar-I added a generous half cup honey-I added an extra quarter cup GF flour-I added an extra half teaspoon baking soda-I added an extra 1/4 teaspoon salt-I baked it for 40 mins (apparently honey can make stuff burn)- I could have even baked it for 35 mins.It was fantastic! I am sure the recipe would be great as is, if you don't do the honey switch. (The honey was plenty sweet btw!) 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This is the best Banana Bread I've ever made! !! It is so moist and delicious!!! Made is as the recipe shows. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This is the best homemade banana bread I have made, regular or gluten free. My 23 year old daughter, who has to eat gluten free, was like a little kid because I used to make regular all the time and she's been craving a good gf recipe. It looks like we've found a keeper! She and my husband absolutely loved it. I will be using this recipe from now on. Thank you for sharing! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Excellent, would not change a thing!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Awesome! Super moist. You would never know these are gluten free.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#...too much wet mixture bread comes out soggy
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#1#0#Made this and used Egg Replacer as we have egg allergies. It was AWESOME! Fabulous recipe! Used King Arthur Gluten Free flour and Bob's Red Mill egg replacer. I halved the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was still plenty sweet. I may cut it down to 1/4 next time and see how sweet it is. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This was excellent! It was moist and did not taste like your typical crumbly gluten free breads. I made them into muffins, which cut the cooking time down to 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Also, I didn't have any oil so substituted butter, and in order to cut down on the carbohydrate count used Truvia instead of regular sugar. Awesome recipe!! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#The banana bread was super moist, very tasty. However this doesn't have the rise of a normal banana bread which is usually about 3 to 4 inches high. this was about 2 inches high. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Easy recipe. Moist, flavorful bread. I forget it is gluten free when eating it! Inexpensive breakfast or snack. Will make this my go to banana bread recipe!!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I made this and shared it with my neighbors, they didn't even know it was gluten free. I told them and they couldn't believe it. It is very moist and I gave it the three day test, it's still good and moist. Plus the best part, I didn't change a thing from the recipe above. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#this one is a keeper - and I would like to share one or two of my modificationsI used one cup of GF flour and one cup of coconut flour (also GF) and I added and extra half a teaspoon of vanilla - very Yummy indeed
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This was the greatest gluten free banana bread ever. The only substitution I did was I did half coconut oil with half canola oil. I also added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I took a loaf to work and it vanished in seconds with many requests for the recipe as they could not tell it was gluten free because it was so moist and flavorful.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#First and only gluten free banana bread recipe I'll ever use. Even my husband, chef and gluten lover couldn't get enough of this bread. Substitutions/additions as follows: replaced canola with organic raw coconut oil, and sugar with raw honey. I also added a cup or so crushed pecans, about 1/2 tsp of coconut extract, cinnamon and nutmeg. Amazingly moist and wonderful flavor (my husband is NOT a coconut fan) 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This recipe is awesome! I use my own flour mix and add cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. I like spice!! I also just use two large bananas. Everything else exactly to the recipe and I haven't had a bad batch yet! It makes 5 mini loaves. Everyone in the family gets their own loaf, and they never even have a chance to cool!! Thank you for this yummy banana bread recipe!!! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This was spot on delicious! I replaced applesauce with greek yogurt and the canola oil with coconut 1:1. It was perfect texture, taste. I pretty much gobbled half a loaf down before it even cooled. Yum!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I was surprised to not have to use Xanthan gum powder for this recipe, but I was also intrigued because it was described to'taste like the real thing'. I included chocolate chips, and guessed at the reduced time for muffins (when they achieved the expected brown colour). Anyway, they turned out slightly dry so I will try removing them sooner next time. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#My family loved this banana bread. My daughter and my husband can only enjoy gluten free recipes. I added dried cranberries to the mix and wow, what a splendid treat.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#My husband and I love this recipe. Instead of loaves I make muffins and reduce the baking time to 30 minutes. I also add a cup of Hersey's Cinnamon Chips. Yum! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Wow! So tasty, and the perfect texture. People will be floored that this is gluten free. This went like a dream! I altered the recipe in these four ways...I increased the ingredients by another 50% because I needed a third loaf. I used warmed coconut oil instead of canola oil. I added 1/4 chopped dates to the batter. I added 1/2 t. Cinnamon.And in my oven, possibly because of 3 loaves at a time, perfection in 55 minutes. Enjoy!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I'm not gluten free, but I wanted to try a gluten free recipe and settled with this one. I halved the original recipe and baked just one loaf. I also added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. At first, just looking at the texture of a slice, I thought I wouldn't like it at all. But, I tried it and it tasted great! It was moist, and the flavors are spot on. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Can this recipe be cut in half? If so would you use1/2 tsp baking soda? I just want to make the 1 loaf just to try it.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Really tasty; even my friends who can have gluten love it!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This recipe makes fantastic banana bread. My mom always used spices in her banana bread so I added 1tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I used coconut butter instead of the oil. It turned out great, moist and delicious. It did not leave that dry mouth (need a drink now) feeling like most gluten-free baked goods leave. I loved it! My husband loves it too and he is not gluten-free. Thank you so much for this recipe! A+. And thanks to my daughter in law for asking me to find a gluten-free banana bread recipe she could use for her Girl Scout troop. My search led me here! The girls are going to love it!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I agree with everyone else. This recipe is fabulous moist and delicious! People will not think it is gluten free. I used pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had on hand. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#It's a winner for sure! Loved the texture & taste. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I did a half recipe of this and added 1/8 t of cinnamon and it came out amazing. Everyone is right... This is very moist and delicious!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This is the best gluten free recipe for banana bread so far. I have family try it and surprised I used gluten free flour as it tastes like the real thing and so moist! I was skeptical how soupy it is with all the ingredients mixed together. Don't be alarmed with the soupiness as it bakes perfectly. I made my own gluten free flour and followed the recipe to the T. Next time, I will try to substitute with coconut oil vs. canola oil. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#At last a moist, delicious GLUTEN FREE banana bread recipe!! I used one cup Gf all purpose flour and one cup brown rice flour bc that's what I had on hand. I also substituted coconut oil for the canola oil and stevia for the sugar. Thanks for sharing! Honestly, it taste like a great cake! Delicious!! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I can't review flavor yet as it's currently baking away but the recipe was simple and quick! A few changes though: Splenda in place of sugar, three egg whites & one whole egg (we're watching our cholesterol intake), homemade fruit sauce instead of apple sauce and since everyone commented about soupy batter I added a 1/4 cup of hemp seeds to think and add a little extra nutrition punch. Let you know how it tastes! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Fantastic! I subbed the apple sauce & oil for equal amounts coconut oil, & used 1 &1/2 cup brown sugar. It came out dense & moist & actually held it's shape when I cut it! Plus it's the first banana bread I've baked that only took 45min to cook. Will make again!! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Fantastic recipe! Taste like the'real' thing! A real winner! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I loved it! The best Gf banana bread recipe, by far. It's easy to prepare and keeps well in the fridge for more than a week!! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#omg!!! My first gf bread just came out of my oven ... and I love it so do my hubby too ... Thank you so much for sharing that recipe ... I didn't change anything and it came out so good:) 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This recipe was delish! I was a bit afraid of it being dry but boy was I wrong! I exchanged some ingredients. Egg whites vs. regular eggs. Stevia vs. real sugar. Coconut oil vs. canola oil. Sea salt vs. table salt. For the gluten free flour I used Bobs Red Mill sweet white sorghum flour....my man loved it and so did my little one!!! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Thank you for posting this recipe. I changed it a bit with fine results. Here's what I did: omitted the applesauce and used a tad less sugar, used a tad more flour(maybe a few extra tablespoons because I did not measure flour exactly), used softened butter instead of oil and baked the batter in one larger glass loaf pan instead of two smaller ones. I used whole walnuts, not chopped walnuts. Toward the end of baking (last 20 minutes) I lowered the oven temperature to 325 degrees. This came out the best so far out of all the gluten free recipes for banana bread I have tried. I also used a homemade recipe for gluten free flour that contains the following: white rice flour, brown rice flour, potato starch, tapioca starch, pectin and xanthan gum. The raw batter was thick going into the pan. Once the butter and sugar were creamed, I basically dumped everything else in including whole peeled bananas, and whipped it all up in my kitchen aid mixer for less than a minute. I liked the sprinkled nuts on top(which I did not measure) as opposed to mixing them into the batter. I just made sure the top of the batter was covered nicely with walnuts. The nuts get nice and toasted and it looks good, too! By the way, there is no milk in this recipe. Perhaps leaving out the applesauce is why the batter was not soupy. I like to alter recipes when I don't have all the ingredients on hand. I also like this recipe because it uses a lot of ripe bananas, which I had plenty of today : ) 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I've never made gf banana bread before, but I have made other gf goodies that do turn out pretty good, but notably different from their non-gf counterparts. This banana bread was absolutely amazing and EASY! It's just like regular banana bread & I received multiple compliments on it. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I could tell the batter was very soupy for a bread recipe, I stirred in another 3/4 cup of GF all purpose flour, stirred in the nuts and because I was shy one banana, I added a small, peeled and shredded zucchini. That gave More consistency to the batter. I use almond milk in place of cows milk too. Came out wonderful! Moist, sliced well... Now we will see how she freezes!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This bread is very good. It may be a little too moist for some, but I found it to be good. My daughter has gone to gluten-free and sugar-free. I replaced the sugar with coconut sugar and it turned out great. I will be making this again.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I like the recipe but I think it is too moist. I made it with 4 large bananas and felt it was going to be like soup. I added a 1/2 cup extra flour and it was still a little too moist for me. But my guests said it was very good and didn't know it was GF. Also I mixed the nuts in. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Took an hour and a half to set properly, too wet of a mixture. Tastes ok though.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I just made this today. One baking pan with walnuts, the other without, both delicious. Is there any reason why the walnuts are not mixed into the batter, rather than sprinkled on top? Please let me know. Thanks! P.S. I made no substitutions and used home-made applesauce.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Perfect! Slightly tweaked this recipe too, by using my homemade apple butter instead of applesauce. Very moist...love it! 5-star!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Very moist
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This is a great recipe to introduce people to how delicious gluten free can be. Be careful though, when this is fresh out of the oven some might lose control!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This was amazing! Instead of prepared applesauce; I vitamixed a small apple (1/2+ cup) and added 6 med bananas (about 2 1/2 cups). Substituted coconut oil instead of canola. 3/4 cup walnuts and omitted vanilla. Between the 5 of us and grandma visiting; it was gone in 2 days. Today I am going to do the same but substitute the apple with raspberry. I may substitute half the flour out with almond meal or coconut flour... we'll see. Thank you! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#My entire family LOVED it!!! I substituted coconut oil for canola & agave nectar for sugar to make it a cleaner version :)
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Usually I don't condone reviewing a recipe if I have adjusted it in any way, but this one is so adaptable, I decided to go ahead. I helped my son make this. We only had 2 bananas so we halved the recipe and swapped out canola for coconut oil. More calories, but everyone is saying it's good for autism so I am having him use it whenever possible. Anyway the bread was moist and delicious. My husband, who is notoriously fussy, called it lethal because he didn't want to stop eating. We won't be cutting this recipe in half next time! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Question has anyone tried this recipe subbing out the bananas or zucchini. It s that time of the year where zucchini is so cheap.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#OMG...I just finished baking this bread and it was delicious. I baked it as is with the exception of 2 things. I omitted the walnuts(allergic) and used a spring form pan instead. That's all I had. It still came out great. Will bake again with less sugar. I think 2/3 cup would've been better :) 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Just made this today my first recipe baking with gluten free flour. Kit turned out even after putting it in the oven and realizing I forgot the eggs, I quickly grabbed it out of the oven whipped up the eggs mixed them in hoping for the best.It is great so light no one would ever guess it is gluten free.I did make only one in a 9X5 pan and it is perfect, I will make it again. Hopefully next time I will remember the eggs.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I just pulled these out of the oven and couldn't wait until the bread was cool to taste - they are SO GOOD! Next time I will take the advice of a few others to bake it in one larger loaf pan instead of two. They were fine in the two, but I didn't have the exact size. I made it exactly as the recipe stated other than adding the nuts because one of my granddaughters is allergice to tree nuts. Great texture! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This was my best GF bread to date. Used Pamela's baking mix and a stick of butter instead of oil. Left out apple sauce since didn't have any. Baked in one large loaf pan. Came out perfectly moist and delicious! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#First recipe I've made from this web site. EXCELLENT. I used Pamela's GF baking mix and substituted in 1/2 cup of coconut flour. I also used the coconut flour, instead of canola oil. Finally, I added 1/2 bag of chocolate chips. Divine! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I HIGHLY recommend substituting coconut oil for the canola. It makes such a huge difference in the moistness of the bread. It also tastes better. And I also add chocolate chips:)
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Just made this Banana Bread and I thought it was great. I am gluten and dairy intolerant and thought I would never get to enjoy Banana Bread again! Boy was I surprised at how this recipe tasted. So was everyone else that tried it. I did not make two loaves as the recipe stated. I thought the loaves would be to small so I poured mixture into one pan. I was concerned because it was very runny(unlike traditional flour mixture). It did take longer to cook but it was perfect. Thank you for this great recipe
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#5 stars!!! This is the best gluten free bread recipe I have found yet! My daughter eats a banana every morning, usually not finishing them - so I stick them in the freezer for later. I'll be making this again soon, since she has already devoured 2 pieces!!! Thank you. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#My daughters are always begging me to make banana bread, but since having to go gluten free (as well as many other ingredients we are banned from digestively) baking has been only a few trials and mostly errors due to consistency issues. This recipe came out awesome! The flour I used had xanthum gum added so I am thinking that helped the bread keep it's shape. My regular banana breads never came out of the pan in loaf form..LOL. I added chocolate chips but kept the rest of the recipe the same. Will definitely make this often! Yum! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This was an awesome recipe. I only made one loaf- I halved the recipe. The best banana bread I ever made. Our kids ate it up- there was none left! I didn't use the walnuts, since we didn't have any. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Lovely recipe! My banana bread was perfect. I didn't have applesauce so I left it out and it was still devine.Great and very easy recipe 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I am gluten free for almost 30 years---3 out of my 17 grandchildren are also gluten free. We all love this recipe--I make it for them often. The problem is everyone loves it, so the gluten free people have to hide it or they end up with crumbs. Thanks!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I made this recipe yesterday. My youngest child has a Wheat allergy and is a very picky eater. He loved the banana bread. My oldest child also loved the bread. Thank you for a wonderful allergy friendly recipe.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I followed exactly except to add some chocolate chips! Yummy
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Great recipe. I made it exactly as it says, but made mini loafs. I've made it a few times and it turns out great. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Make it once a week, this is probably the best banana bread I have ever had! Moist, not crumbly and makes super french toast!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Make it once a week, this is probably the best banana bread I have ever had! Moist, not crumbly and makes super french toast!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#So moist and flavorful!! 10 out of 10!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I followed the suggestion of the other reviewers and added 1/2C sorghum flour. My bread turned out BEAUTIFULLY! I baked this recipe and my regular recipe and had the family taste test them side by side. Although they guessed which one was gluten free, an observation was that the GF bread was more moist. From here on out, THIS is my go-to recipe!!! :)
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#We used this recipe in our mini doughnut maker and loved it. We substituted the walnuts for freeze dried strawberries.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I have tried many GF banana bread recipes (as well as other sweet GF breads) and this is one of the best. Unlike many others- it does not have that gluten free taste. Plus - it is healthy, which makes it even better. Love it and will make it again.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Easy and excellent texture and taste - better that my non GF. I made muffins and added a few choc. chips for my kids! I've sent this link to all my GF friends. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This recipe definitely has more potential than the one I've been making, however it came out much too moist even though the toothpick I stuck into the middle after 50 minutes of baking came out completely dry. I did as instructed, took it out of the oven and let it sit for ten minutes. It completely fell. I then turned it oven on a cool rack to continue letting it cool. Way too moist. Any ideas? I followed the ingredient list exactly as listed. I made my own apple sauce without any sugar and it could be that I put too much water in the pot, so maybe this was the problem. I'm certainly going to try this again with the extra 1/2 cup flour, probably sorghum. Any ideas for me other than this? Thanks. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#1#This was excellent. Made muffins - first batch with nuts, second with chocolate chips and nuts, and third with blueberries. All were awesome. I am new to GF having only been on it for 1 month so this has been all new and hard, but not as hard as it could have been without the internet and lots of recipes. Now if I could master bread/rolls and fried chicken.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This was an easy and very tasty banana bread. Definitely will be making this again.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This is the moistest, most wonderful gluten free dessert I've found. I buy extra bananas now, just so I have them to make this recipe. My husband is a gluten-free phone , but he loves this. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This recipe is as good as the real thing ! I folled the recipe exactly as written, but baked in three smaller pans. I could not believe how moist it was. I have since adapted the recipe by substituting banans for canned pumpkin, added some cinnamon, nutmeg and a cup of chopped apples and made a fabulous pumpkin apple bread. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I have been GF for years and this recipe is the BEST!!!! I have made so many banana bread recipes and none of them tasted normal . This recipe is SO SO good!I too used 2 1/2 cups of flour and I did not use the oil.ENJOY!!!!!SOOOOO good! :) 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Excellent recipe for banana bread for an allergy free diet!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#1#0#Fabulous.I didn't have applesauce so I used Canned Pumpkin.WOWWW! It was so wonderful.Thank you 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Like what everyone else wrote, this is very moist with a very nice flavor. I used Pamela's Baking Mix and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. Someone else wrote that she added 1/2 cup baking mix and I might try that next time to get a larger loaf. This tastes like the real thing and you won't even know it's gluten free :-) 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I just had my first piece. Absolutely delicious. Even my husband (the skeptic) loves it. Thank you so much
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Wonderful recipe, very moist! Slightly crumbly, so remove from the pan carefully. We used rice flour, which is what we had on hand, and substituted 1/2 chopped apple for the applesauce. No one will know it's gluten-free. Delicious! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#EXCELLENT! This truly does taste like normal banana bread. You would never know it's gluten free. I had to use 6.5 bananas to get the required 2 cups. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I used this recipe as my first attempt at baking gluten-free bread. As promised, it tastes like the real thing. My dance teammates are still in disbelief that the loaf was gluten-free! :-)[Note: I added a simple crumb topping (brown sugar, gluten-free all purpose flour, almonds, and butter) prior to baking.] 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Excellent bread, convection baked at 350 in a Pyrex pan and metal pan, the Pyrex took 5 minutes more (50 minutes). Used an add'l 1/2c of Maple Grove Farms pancake mix and 4t xanthan gum. With 3/4c sugar and medium ripe bananas it's not overly sweet. I'll add chocolate chips next time. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#New at gluten-free. Most does not taste good. This is great and moist! I used pumpkin in place of the applesauce. Super! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This turned out fantastic! I used 2 cups of Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free AP flour and added an extra 1/2 cup of Sorghum flour. I also substituted refined sugar for coconut sugar to make it a bit healthier. My hubby and I gobbled this up! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Love this recipe. Made it a couple of times now and both times delicious. I never thought I'd have banana bread again! YUM! Make sure you add Xanthan Gum to the flour mixture if you are using Bob's all purpose flour to make it light. 2 t. per cup of flour. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This Banana bread is amazing! I just started working with a toddler that cannot have any gluten, and looking for things that he can enjoy eating. Did anyone try to make this in cupcake or mini loaf sizes? Do you think that it could work?
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This was my 1st time making a gluten free banana bread. I am new to gluten free lifestyle per Dr. orders, I am also trying to get my family into the lifestyle so we can enjoy food together as I always feel left out. I made this recipe without the applesauce.Per the advice of other reviews I also added a 1/2 cup more flour but I used Bob's Red Mills Pancake mix. I only used 3 eggs and 3/4 sugar. My family loved it, they had no idea it was gluten free! I added enjoy life mini chocolate chips to one loaf and they loved it! Next time I think I will add more vanilla n cinnamon! TY SO MUCH I BEEN MISSING MY BANANA BREAD!! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Simple recipe, not dry not gummy in the middle. I used 2 c rice flour and 1/2 c sorghum. I used coconut oil since I didn't have any canola oil (melt first). Accidentally used 1/2 c instead of 1/3, recipe still turned out good. Also used almond extract cause I didn't have vanilla. Baked in a 9 x 12 pan For 55 min. I'd like to try adding shredded coconut next time, maybe chocolate chips. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I just love this recipe. You really can't tell it's GF. My husband and oldest daughter couldn't tell. I read the reviews and went with the extra 1/2 cup flour. They said it made it less denser. It tasted so moist and fluffy. Will keep in my recipe file. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Best gluten free recipe I have made. My whole family loved it.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#At first I wasn't sure I liked this recipe as it was my first GF banana bread...then after I devoured the half of the loaf I realized I finally found a good sub for my usual recipe. Added about a 1/2 cup of fresh blueberrys to one of the loaves which turned out great! My husband couldnt even tell it was gluten free:) 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I used All purpose Gluten Free baking mix from Arrowhead Mills. I found that if you use two disposable bread tins they do come out doughy in the center. They come out perfect and both loafs were consumed in one day. I making this again now.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This was so yummy! It tasted as good as the regular kind. Served it ot friends and they couldn't tell it was Gluten-Free. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This recipe was simple and delicious. I used 1 1/2 cups gf all purpose flour and 1/2 cup rice flour. I also cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. Finally, I didn't have loaf pans so I baked it in a large stainless steel skillet for 48 minutes. The bread rose and was perfectly cooked. Thanks, I definitely make this again! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I did not have all purpose flour so I used 1 3/4 oat flour plus 2 t xanthium gum and 1/4 cup almond flour, plus 1 T ground flax seeds. I used 3/4 organic sugar and sweetened applesause. I used 4 very ripe bananas and mixed in the nuts. I baked the two loaves at 375 convection bake. It came out great. Moist, very light in texture. I think you could use any gluten free flour and by adding the xanthium gum you will have a good result.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I forgot to mention that I added the walnuts right to the batter and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top. I used two foil loaf pans and it was done exactly when it said in the recipe. Perfect texture.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This is the best banana bread I have ever made or eaten. It is the real thing. Just because the flour used is gluten free does not mean that its not the Real Thing .. Everyone raved about it. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I hate to be the only one to not be satisfied with this recipe, but it did not turn out. It was EXTREMELY dense. So dense in fact that it was raw and runny in the middle and almost burnt on the outside after an hour in the oven. I have no clue what i did wrong. I got it to the point of edible in the middle. I even made a test batch and added more flower because that was slightly too wet. I think it would do best as two small loaves. It had a great flavor though and the outside is wonderful. I need help to make this right!!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This is just the best. When I had added all of the ingredients, I thought I messed up someplace the dough was almost as runny as cake batter but I baked it anyway, thinking I would end up throwing it all away and to my great surprise it was just the best. Thank you so much from my daughter and me who haven't had any baked products for so long because of gluten. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#The breads just came out of the oven and they look perfect. The aroma in the house was heavenly.Like someone else had mentioned, I didn't use applesauce. I added 1 teaspoon of xanthan gum, 2 tablespoons of coconut oil and 1 teaspoon cinnamon powder.I had to cut a piece, I couldn't wait for the bread to cool. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I made this bread and it was wonderful. I added 1 tsp of Xanthan Gum and 1 tsp of cinnamon, omitted the applesauce and used half brown and half granulated sugar. I honestly could not tell the difference between this and the traditional recipe I've always used! Thanks so much, I'll be making this frequently! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This bread is great! You would never know that this is GF. I varied the recipe just a bit - I used 1 1/2 c GF all purpose flour and 1/2 c gf sorghum flour. I also used frozen mashed over-ripe bananas. They are very juicy and this allowed me to eliminate the canola oil. Next time I will add some chocolate chips as an extra treat.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#So far the best I have made except it was a bit heavy and I had to cook it for 65min and it still felt like I needed to cook it more, but I took it out. Any suggestions to make it lighter?? I substituted stevia for sugar, and added Xanthan gum to flour.dbertan
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This bread was awesome!! My GF kids and non GF kid loved it! Added raisins and walnuts!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#next time would add yoghurt in place of applesauce (normally used and gives moisture but also great taste). Prefer recipes that outline exactly what the gluten-free flour combo is.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Going all Gluten Free! This was my first recipe and it's definitely a winner! The first time I made it I used 5 bananas and it wasmore traditional in texture. In place of sugar I used Sun Crystal which is being discontinued... So next I'm going to try Just Like Sugar which is made from chicory root. It has no calories or sugar effect at all. It is completely natural with a very slight orange aftertaste from the white part of the rind that is used in the product. It's not as sweet as sugar but has a similar consistency. You can google it online. I've been trying to find a product similar to sugar so I could convert recipes more easily. This is a great recipe and freezes well too! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This truly was a winner! I followed another cook's suggestions and added in an additional 1/2 C. of GF flour. So I used 2 C. of a finely ground brown rice mix that I use for most of my recipes and then an additional 1/2 C. of sorghum flour, which bakes like a dream in GF baked goodies. I also made another'applesauce' version where I subbed in applesauce for the bananas, and then used Greek yogurt in place of the original 1/2 C. of applesauce. It produced the same great texture and wonderful, light taste. And for sugar in both recipes, I used 1/2 C. raw cane sugar, which is brown and tastes like brown sugar, and then 1/3 C. agave nectar, the dark amber kind. It was perfectly sweet but not too heavy. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Tastes just like any other banana bread. I made two batches. One following the recipe, and one with an extra 1/2 cup of GF flour. They both tasted the same, the difference being the size and density of the loaf. The one with extra flour turned out like a traditional loaf of banana bread, while the one following the recipe turned out more dense and flatter. Both batches didn't last more than a day in my house. :-) 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This recipe really is good! While it bakes, it smells so delicious that you just want to dive in before it is finished baking. For me 45 minutes was enough. The bread was not crumbly or dry. It was the perfect amount of moisture, and the flavor was great! I am very impressed since it is a GF recipe. Some do not turn out this well.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I made this for my mom and she loved it. She kept asking if I was sure it was gluten free! I didn't have enough bananas so I used 2 cups of pumpkin instead and added dried cranberries. It was great - mom keeps asking for me to make it again. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#This is an extremely moist bread with a strong banana flavor. My family and friends found it very tasty. I will definitely be making it many times again.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#YUM!!! I'm so happy I gave this recipe a try! My GF boyfriend was very happy! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#My daughter has Celiac Disease, she loves this recipe because she says it tastes like'real' food after having to give up so many flavors. Thank You!! We plan on adding different chocolates to it and nuts for variations. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Everyone at our church loved this. I substituted 1 cup of Truvia for the sugar & used mushy frozen bananas as well as refrigerated ones. Had to add an extra cup of GF all-purpose baking mix; still turned out well. Several people were happy it was gluten & sugar-free. Definitely a keeper!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I've been trying lots of recipes for a GF banana bread and hands down this is the best one! My GF four mix was 1.5 cups brown rice flour and 1/2 cup Bob's Redmill GF Flour Mix and 1tsp Xanthum gum.Couldn't taste the GF flour at all!One word for this recipe: P E R F E C T !!! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#My husband and I were both skeptical, but this is amazing.
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I am sooo happy that I found this recipe. I have been gluten free for a while and always have a hard time eating the GF baked goods because of an unusual flavor...well, this recipe tastes almost like regular banana bread. It is so good!! I will DEFINITELY make this again!!!
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I made this because I can't eat gluten and really wanted to eat something that normal people can eat. It was so moist and good and tasted like normal banana bread and held up really well. I didn't use the nuts but I don't care for nuts but I'm sure it would have been good with them. I let several people try it that can eat gluten and they said it was really good and didn't know it was gluten free until I told them. Will be making this recipe again. 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Very good! and that's from someone new to a gluten-free diet! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I made this bread for my daughter last night and we were both very impressed with its incredible moistness and heavenly taste. Thank you, Taste of Home! We'll be making this recipe as often as possible! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#Made it for my neighbor's daughter who has celiac's disease. She LOVED it! My family loved it too. My son was afraid to try it because I had told him it was gluten-free, but once he tasted it, he couldn't stop eating it! 
Gluten-Free Banana Bread#0#0#I made this bread for my niece who is gluten intolerant. It was delicious and she was so happy to be able to eat banana bread again!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#2#0#Question, instead of grilling (I don't own a grill, could you perhaps, cook these in a slow cooker? Seems like they would come out very tender and tasty? 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#3#0#This is my go to marinade. Use it for everything. Thank you!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#37#26#Mouthwatering! I substituted boneless, skinless chicken for bone-in. It is less likely to dry out during grilling. I also grilled rings of fresh pineapple, basting with butter and brown sugar. Served with coconut rice. You'll want leftovers! 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#10#0#This is amazing! It never disappoints!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#13#1#I joined this website recently. There are only two of us. Is there a way to adjust the serving amount and the website automatically adjusts the amount of ingredients?
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#8#2#Simple but full of flavor, very tasty and easy to make making my family and friends wanting more and more of it . It's going to be my never missed dish in every occasion or celebration I have ???????????????????? 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#3#0#Very delicious. Will definitely make again.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This is our favorite grilled chicken recipe. Great flavor!!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#7#0#This is a very tasty and easy recipe! My family loves it, they always ask ahead of time for me to make it when they come to visit. I actually make it in the air fryer and it's always moist and delicious!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#8#0#This was better than expected and I was expecting something good! The only thing I did different was used 1/2 sherry and 1/2 chicken broth, might use all sherry next time! WHEN I make this again I think I will also use a little less soy sauce, I found it more salty than sweet!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#14#0#This recipe is amazing! We changed it slightly by replacing the marinating step with putting it in a crockpot on low for 8 hours. Then we threw the chicken on a hot grille for just a couple of minutes per side. The chicken fell right off of the bone and because the chicken cooked in the marinade, we were able to use it over rice which was heavenly. Thanks for the recipe.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#4#2#This is a family favorite.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#5#5#I made it for my husband who is Hawaiian. He said it was delicious then he gave me his family recipe for Huli Huli chicken. This recipe will be made again.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#4#0#Fantastic flavorful chicken! Hubby and I both loved it. I halved the marinade and made 4 boneless breasts. I forgot to marinate it the night before, and it was still amazing. A definite easy keeper.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#4#2#The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because the flavor of the sherry over powered the other tasty ingredients. I feel as though using the chicken broth would have been a better choice for me. Will be trying again.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#2#1#We liked the marinade, I just added pineapple to it, because we love pineapple chicken. I added chicken breast along with the thighs.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Very good and easy to make!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#2#10#After mixing marinate ingredients together, I thought it was a bit bland so I added extra garlic and ginger, also some hot pepper flakes and salt and it was a tasty terriaki style chicken. I'd say it was about average but I really liked the boneless and skinless thighs. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#0#Made this a 2nd time and it did not disappoint again. Very aromatic while grilling, amazing taste, and juicy! Definitely going in the recipe box
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#4#4#I made this the other night and it was very good. Good taste, juicy chicken, and my husband, who doesn't like too many things new, liked it. The only thing I would caution against is- don't cook on a George Foreman grill. I think it was the brown sugar- it formed into a HARD shell and was nearly impossible to cut through it. I'm sure this is really good on an outside grill. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Loved this recipe taste was great .. I had boneless skinless breast in the freezer so used them .. I used all of the marinade on the chicken
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#0#Mace this last night, the only thing I didn't add was ginger (I forgot to buy it), this stuff was amazing!! My teenage son AND husband went back for seconds. This is going in my regular rotation!!!! 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This turned out really well! I loved the flavor from the marinade. Delicious!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#11#4#Tasted great. Cooked as recipe stated with exact quantities. Thighs were tender and a big hit with the family. Word of warning if cooking on a bbq. Be prepared for a lot of cleaning. I soaked grills overnight and the used oven cleaner. Our gerni high pressure cleaner still could not remove the vharred marinate. The brown sugar hardens like cement and i ended up using a hammer and screwdriver to try and get it to let go. Next time i will use a disposable foil grill on top of the bbq burners.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#0#Fantastic that's it. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#10#5#BEST RECIPE EVER!! I didn't have ginger root and I did not marinate overnight, or grill lol But pan sauté with a little olive oil - covered to let the flavor simmer all the way through. The last 4 min I put pineapple slices on top of each piece of chicken breast. Then reduce down and serve! Yummmmm....
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#1#I was given a huli huli chicken marinade years ago by a co worker that is a little different. It calls for honey, brown sugar, soy sauce ( called shoy-u in Hawaii) and lemon juice. It is delicious marinated for 24 hours and grilled. Looking forward to trying this version also
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#6#0#ATTENTION: Taste of Home. I love to print your recipes to add to my collection. I do wish your Test Kitchen Tips would print, also. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#0#I have made this recipe numerous times. It is so easy and tastes delicious. Everyone loves it!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#I've made this several times. My Hawaiian husband raves on this. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#19#0#Our young children begged for seconds. Yeah, a HUGE win! We will save and print this recipe. Thank you!!! We ran out of propane, so we baked the chicken at 375, uncovered, for 35-40 minutes and basted it the last five minutes. Thank you!!!!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#4#0#This is a family favorite! It is good with any type of chicken - breast, legs, thighs. I use about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of ground ginger instead of gingerroot.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#0#This is such a great recipe!! I prepared this for a pool party we had and everyone loved it!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#3#1#Huge hit at a lunch party I hosted this past weekend. Only 5 of us eating, so I scaled back to 3 lbs. of chicken but still made the full amount of marinade and had plenty. Like others, I decided to use 1/4 c. less soy sauce and add 1/4 c. pineapple juice. I thought we would have tons of leftovers, but only 2 pieces remained at the end.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#2#0#I prepared this for our Boy Scouts, Troop 205 for 25 people at Camp Cherokee , and there was none left, they have been asking when will I make it again, I gave 9 parents the recipe. I also did 1/4 lite soy sauce and added 1/4 pineapple juice. I love it. I will be making the again.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#2#0#Cut back 1/4 on the soy sauce and add 1/4 cup of pineapple juice. Original Island Huli Huli always includes pineapple juice.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#0#Cut back 1/4 on the soy sauce and add 1/4 cup of pineapple juice. Original Island Huli Huli always includes pineapple juice.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#4#0#I made this recipe using both chicken thighs and breasts and I like the taste of the chicken breasts the best. They seemed to absorb more of the marinade and the flavor was very bright. I thought the flavor was a little subdued in the thigh meat.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Have made this many times and is normally one of the recipes i prepare while stocking up my freezer. So yummy!!!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#at the end let it sit in 2 tbs of butter and green onions chopped .. winning!!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This was not as sweet as I was hoping for. The taste of the soy sauce was a little overpowering (and I did use the lite soy sauce). Might try again and alter it slightly.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#6#0#I use sweet baby Ray's BBQ sauce instead of ketchup to give it a more sweet and smokey flavor, but other than that I keep it the same. Always gets high praise from freinds and family at cookouts! 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#I want to bake using this recipe. How high should I have the temperature? How long would I cook the chicken for and do I need to turn the chicken over halfway through? Thank you for your help
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#0#Great marinade for grilled chicken. I also used with pork which was fantastic as well.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Delicious. Thanks for sharing a flavorful recipe. Enjoyed by all.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#2#0#I have made this several times and the only I did different was to add a little corn starch to the reserved sauce heating it to thicken it up and because I'm cooking for larger group of people I double the recipe. I have had equal success on the BBQ and the oven. The guys all crave this chicken! 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#I didn't use the broth plus I used chili sauce instead of soy sauce and it tasted great! 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Excellent. This will become a new go to recipe!

Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Delicious, a hit with the entire family!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#0#used skin on, bone-in chicken thighs and drumsticks...but followed the recipe exactly in every other way. The neighbor leaned over the fence while we were grilling it to remark how amazing it smelled! This is definitely a keeper. The taste is out of this world.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Awesome marinade/sauce! I added some hot pepper paste and peri peri seasoning (a Northern Africa pepper blend containing fenugreek).
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Very good chicken recipe! Moist and good flavor!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#I've made these chicken thighs about 100 times. Sometimes I forget the basting sauce and sometimes I don't. It's good either way. I always get asked for the recipe too. This is my go to potluck dish. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Used it with some thin cut chicken breasts and had excellent flavor with the grill marks. Can see why it would be great with thighs or wings.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#I have to admit, I tried this recipe because I thought the name was so cute. I was going to a football party so I used wings instead of thighs. It was a big hit. They licked the platter clean!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#My family loves this recipe. I reduced the amount of ingredients to fit 4 boneless chicken breast and I have an indoor grill. Favor is fabulous
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#1#I needed to come up with a quick dinner tonight. A friend posted this recipe on her FB page and it looked delicious. I used chicken breast instead of thighs and heated the marinade to pour over the chicken. I also used it on the chicken as it cooked on my stove top grill pan. It was a big hit! I served it over RiceARoni chicken flavored pasta. It would've been better had I had the time to allow it to marinate. This one's a keeper for sure! 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#0#Hands down, the best grilled chicken I've ever eaten. I didn't change a thing, other than scaling back all quantities for less chicken. The full recipe will be fantastic for summer get-togethers with more of a crowd. I'm already imagining using some of the basting sauce on some grilled pineapple next time! 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Made this last night , and this is a KEEPER!! So yummy, did exactly as the recipe states , absolutely delish!!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This is a go-to recipe in our house, especially when we have people over in the summer. Whenever I make it, people always ask me for the recipe.The only change I make is to use boneless chicken breasts rather than chicken thighs.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#So much flavor! Was a huge success at Father's Day barbeque. Everyone couldn't get enough! I used both thighs and skinless boneless breasts. I used chicken broth and 1/4 tsp of ground ginger. Will definitely make this again and again! 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Fantastic! I didn't have sherry or broth, so I used a dry Marsala I had on hand. My family and friends really enjoyed this for Sunday dinner. This marinade would be good with any cut of chicken. We used thighs and wings. I served this with macaroni salad and fresh cut pineapple. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Tasty and tangy grilled chicken! I halved the recipe and used boneless skinless chicken breast pieces.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#0#This chicken - IS...AMAZING!! I have made it upwards of 5 or 6 times now, and it never gets old. I've used both chicken breasts and chicken legs and it is delightful in any form! Instead of sherry/broth I've just used water, and have used ground ginger in place of the fresh gingeroot. A truly delicious chicken dish! 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Fantastic! This was so simple and it tasted like something I would get in a restaurant. Will definitely make this again.

Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Tasty, good way to make grilled chicken. Followed the recipe as is and didn't think it needed to be altered at all. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#2#0#Great sauce. I browned 4 chicken thighs in a skillet . Meanwhile I made 1/2 the sauce in a saucepan, reduced it slightly then added the sauce to the skillet over the chicken. It continued to reduce while the chicken continued to cook. I served it all over rice. It was very tasty and tender. Quick and easy.. servings 2
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#I followed this recipe as is and my husband grilled it up for our Super Bowl party. We got rave reviews and look forward to making this again soon.

Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Husband says its better than bbq!

Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#0#While I was preparing the marinade, I was thinking this is too much work and next time I will stick with bottled marinade. But after I tasted it, I was sold. It is sooooo good. Much better than any bottled marinade I've ever tasted. I will DEFINITELY make this again. Everyone LOVED it! 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#I try this recipe and was very please. It tasted great. I did use the oven but will try the gril next. This is a recipe to keep.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This is one of our favorite ways to fix chicken. It is absolutely delicious. I have used chicken breasts and they work well with this recipe. Here is a link to a review I did a while back. This is definitely a five star recipe.http://community.tasteofhome.com/community_forums/f/30/p/867124/7455685.aspx#7455685 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#We like this chicken the way the original recipe states and we tried it with a 20 oz can of pineapple rings. The juice added a wonderful new dimension to the flavor of the chicken and the pineapple rings were added to the chicken and everything grilled together. I forget who suggested the pineapple juice but it was DELICIOUS!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#We like this chicken the way the original recipe states and we tried it the second time with a 20 oz can of pineapple rings.

I forget who suggested the pineapple juice but it was DELICIOUS!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#I haven't tried this but it looks amazing. My husband lived in Hawaii for a bit when he was in the Navy and introduced this sauce to me. After many years a friend at work went to Hawaii recently and brought me a bottle back. I am so excited to try to make the sauce. Thanks for the recipe. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Have not made this yet, but sounds fantastic. Wonder if anyone has tried the marinade on steak? Sounds like it would work to me. As for the person who asks about Splenda or Sugar Twin sugar substitue, I use Splenda brown sugar in all my recipes that call for brown sugar and they have turned out fine.l
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This is one of our favorite grilling recipes!!!!!!! And it's easy to make. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Thanks, cookiemouse! Using my crockpot to make this chicken sounds even better.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#In response to SimpleFoods - yes, you could bake this in the oven or even cook in a crockpot. It is a very good recipe.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Haven't made this yet, but want to do it in the oven - we don't grill. Somebody else asked the question, nobody answered it: Has anybody done this in the oven? Any reason why we shouldn't?? Helllloooooo? 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#made this a while back,family loved it. Am going to make on mothers day , for my company.its a keeper
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#0#I used chicken breasts instead of thighs. I also used ground ginger instead of fresh, and it still turned out wonderful. I've made it quite a few times. We often have 12 or more guests at a time at our home for supper. Everyone LOVES this chicken. This is one recipe that's a keeper for sure. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This is our favorite new grilling recipe! I cut the recipe in half and use chicken breasts instead...just the right amount for my family.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#3#0#The BEST CHICKEN EVER!!! Yummy! I have marinated it up to 48 hours with no problems. It just gets better. So very, very good. And, I've also baked it in the oven in a pinch when we have a no burn day here in AZ (no barbecuing), and it's wonderful. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This is one of the best new recipe I've tried in a long time. Had no fresh gingerroot but used 1/2 tsp ground ginger. I used chicken breasts cut in half width wise. This is a keeper recipe I'll us over and over. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#0#I used this to marinate roast pork. It was awesome! A definite keeper!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This is not a review as I have not made it yet. Has anyone tried making this using brown sugar substitutes such as Splenda Brown Sugar Blend or Sugar Twin Brown Sugar Replacement?
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#The first time I made this, I didn't let the chicken sit in the marinade for 8 hrs, it was more like a couple of hours. I also forgot to set aside marinade to baste with when grilling. Despite my faults, the taste was still amazing, and it has been requested over and over again. Great flavor, and so easy!!! 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Would make a good grilled chicken sandwich (use breast vs thighs) with grilled pineapple ring and extra sauce.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#We took this marinade camping and LOVED it! We will be using this as our go to bbq chicken marinade from now on.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#We have made this recipe many times because its so easy and delicious. We make it for company and we make it when we are camping. Ive also used the marinade for grilled salmon filets with great results.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This is an awesome recipe! I ran out of soy sauce and only used a quarter cup - it was still fantastic! If you like teriyaki you'll like this! I used boneless breasts and they were great. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Love this recipe -- quick easy and very tasty -- everyone always ask for the recipe!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This recipe sounds so good. We don't grill. Has anyone tried this in the oven? 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#I've used bone-in and skin on thighs and legs. So yummy and full of flavor. New favorite in my home. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#perfect!!!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#I used bone-in, skin-on leg quarters and marinated them all day. Family loved this recipe. Seventeen-year-old son said, You can make this one again for sure! 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#My husband who doesn't like chicken even said this one was good. Very nice and different flavor than usual. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Very good & easy to make!!! I even made it in the late afternoon, didn't read the recipe all the way through seeing that it needed 8 hrs to marinade. I left it marinading at room temp for about an hour, and it was fantastic!!! 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Delicious! I mis-read the recipe and did not reserve marinade for basting and it worked out just fine. I also mixed boneless thighs and boneless chicken breasts (I cut these in half so that the sizes were similar) so that guests could have a choice. Taste was very good; I tried this out on guests and they gave it a thumbs up. It met all of the criteria I have for a winner of a recipe: it was easy, used ingredients that most people would have on hand, could be assembled ahead of time, had a short cook time and, most of all, tasted great!!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This recipe was easy and delicious! A new family favorite! Even pleasing to the harder to please eaters.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This recipe was easy and delicious! A new family favorite! Even pleasing for the harder-to-please eaters.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Great recipe. I used chicken tenderlions, as I was grilling I sprinkled red crushed pepper on them. It was great.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#0#Not sure why stars didn't show up for me to rate this, but yes, FIVE stars. Great flavor. Did it with chicken breasts. Very tender. Only marinated it for about 5 hours. Thanks for the great recipe. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#My family favors chicken breast sliced thin.The flavor is very good.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#The best chicken recipe. Great for get togethers
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This is one of my favorite chicken recipe I always eat this on saturday night, so mahalo for this great recipe We have a food restaurant here in Hawaii that serve this huli huli chicken, just so ono
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#1#I have made this twice already. My entire family absolutely loves this chicken. I make extra marinade to use over white rice.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Delicious! I made the recipe as directed. It was a HUGE hit with the family. This will be my standard marinade recipe for grilled chicken!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This is outstanding! A must for everyone to try. I made three changes: 1/8 tsp. ginger instead of ginger root, 1/2 c. regular soy sauce, boneless/skinless chicken breasts.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#0#Ever since I went to HI in High School and tried Huli Chicken there I have wanted to recipe. Every time we go to HI we bring back as many bottles of Huli sauce as we can. I tried this recipe and it tastes just like it does from HI! Thank you so much. Now I won't have to go to HI to eat this!! 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This was wonderful. The chicken was so moist. The trick is to turn it often and use all the baste. Our company asked for this recipe after dinner. I'm sure this will become a family favorite!! 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This was delicious - picky kids ate without complaining. I used ground ginger because that's what I had on hand and subed in breast for the thighs. 
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#I discovered this recipe while on vacation in HI and knew I would want to try it. I used 4 large boneless skinless chicken breast halves and 3 filet type smaller ones and halved the sauce recipe. Subbed ground ginger and garlic powder for the fresh ginger and garlic since that was what I had on hand. Marinaded in 1 c. sauce and basted with 1/4 c. reserved sauce. Moist, juicy, and delicious. Definite keeper here.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Very easy to prepare ahead of time and then just grill. Served it with grilled fresh pineapple rings, coconut rice and Hawaiian rolls.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#1#2#I marinated sliced mushrooms with this, the last hour only. Grilled with sliced pineapple and served with Rice-A-Roni. Not sure why it says prep time is 15 minutes when it needs to marinate 8 hours! I have had a version of this recipe for many years, and instead of ketchup it asks for 1/3 cup dry sauterne and 3T Dijon mustard. NO brown sugar and half the soy sauce. It is not as salty, and calorie count is lower, but equally good.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Simple, flavorful recipe. Absolutely excellent.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#This is very good and very simple to make.
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Crowd pleaser! So juicy and tender, even better the next day. Yum!
Grilled Huli Huli Chicken#0#0#Used boneless/skinless chicken breast instead of thighs and was wonderful. Will be making this on a regular bases.
Fluffy Pancakes#6#1#Excellent! Light, fluffy and yummy. I doubled the recipe for my family and all gone!
Fluffy Pancakes#6#0#literally the best pancake recipe I've ever tried. I'm glad I did because they were amazing and the whole family loved it! I can't believe how good these are. On my website, I have prepared recipes in infographics https://kitchenbackground.com/ . I invite you. Thank you!!!
Fluffy Pancakes#8#14#The batter is very thin - following this recipe and ladle size, that batter will just spread and spread in the pan. My first pancake was basically a crepe (I wasn't using a huge pan). Had to add more flour to the recipe, so eventually it wound up okay, but I had to play with it first.
Fluffy Pancakes#6#0#These were so good! Perfect and fluffy. Easy for the kids to make with me too. Added chocolate chips??
Fluffy Pancakes#14#6#so im british and wanted to try something new to cook so i tried to kook these pancakes ?? and can i just say OMFG they're sooo good i recomend the recepie and i used honey instead of syrup still good
Fluffy Pancakes#3#1#Very tasty, light. We really liked the taste and texture of the pancakes. Will make again.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Mixed 1st 4 ingredients together to use in a recipe (Lemon Ricotta Pancakes with Lemon Ricotta Cream) calling for 2 cups of pancake mix. Excellent! So easy to adjust to personal taste. Thanks Eugene
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#Good basic recipe for pancakes. I added apple pie spice and nutmeg as well as vanilla. Batter was thin enough with only 3/4 cup of milk. Would also be good with bananas.
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#Excellent
Fluffy Pancakes#2#0#Just ok. These were a bit dense. I should have realized from the batter that it needed more milk. Perhaps 1 cup would have been a better ratio- I usually use the Martha Stewart recipe. I also would suggest adding 1 tsp vanilla.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#My son loves this pancake recipe. No more premade pancake mixes.
Fluffy Pancakes#3#0#Best pancakes ever!!! I used almond milk and Splenda and added a little water because almond milk is thicker and they turned out great! No more boxed mix for me!
Fluffy Pancakes#2#5#The pancakes were fluffy, but the after taste of the baking powder was awful. It ruined the pancakes.
Fluffy Pancakes#3#0#Really good but I burnt them haha, easy and delicious!
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#Yum yum and so easy.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Absolutely the best!!!! The fluffiest. I added only 11/2 tsp of the baking powder and it turned out perfect. I would add another tablespoon of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla the next time.
Fluffy Pancakes#3#0#These pancakes are the best! I love to cook and I am 11. These pancakes are fluffy and now my goto recipie. My sister and brothers loved them! I used baking powder instead of soda and they turned out great! ????????????????
Fluffy Pancakes#0#5#These pancakes are the worst. My siblings and I saw all signs that they were cooked. We took them off, waited for them to cool and they were completely raw in the center. And it took me an hour to make. They said 15 MINUTES. And to top it all off, they weren't even fluffy. I am severely disappointed and will never try these again.
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#I searched for the best ratio of ingredients and this one is perfect. I didn't see a lot of success with 3 1/2 tsp of baking powder, I read it was metallic and not very tasty. I also didn't want to have to use powder and soda, wanted it simple. Only thing I'd tweak is sugar. I added 2 instead of 1tbl sugar, but that's only because it's how I like them. You might prefer 1tbls...for me this recipe is a keeper. And I would definitely melt the butter and let it sit for the few minutes it says to. ???? 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#We don't have pancakes often but I made this recipe for a treat. They were really delicious. I only got six pancakes from the batter but that was plenty for us without batter to waste. I added blueberries to the last half of the batter for fun. When I make them again, I will probably add a little vanilla to amp up the flavor. 
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#Add cinnamon and a splash of vanilla extract and they are perfect!
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#Great pancake recipe! I added more milk, vanilla, a dash of dark chocolate cocoa and banana.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Evan jest super
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Wonderful!Wonderful!Wonderful! Light, fluffy, golden brown pancakes. And a user friendly recipe. My family loved them
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#Simple recipe that delivers great texture and taste. My picky eater 14 year old son loved them! Thanks!
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#Great fluffy pancakes! Everyone in my family loved them
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Im all about easy recipes and this one was perfect for me. My kids wanted pancakes and due to Corona virus anf lack of groceries we didn't have any more premix batter. But I keep I had all the ingredients to make from scratch.. so I did with this recipe and they came out perfectly. 
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#Yummy and easy to make. I added vanilla, cinnamon and added some water because the batter was too thick.
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#These were very tasty pancakes. I substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the all-purpose, then sprinkled blueberries over them while they cooked. They were tall and very fluffy!
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#I thought this recipe was great, although I only got 7 pancakes using a 1/4 c measure. ?? Like other reviewers, I always put in vanilla. Today I sprinkled with cinnamon before I flipped them. Excellent decision.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#This recipe came out perfect, for me. Tall, fluffy pancakes which were fully cooked inside but deeply golden on the outside. I used melted butter, and since it was salted, I cut down the salt by a pinch. Also, I added blueberries just before cooking.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#1#I followed this recipe exactly as it said and the batter came out more like crepe batter. I had to add some extra flour to thicken it up. Still cooking so I have yet to taste.
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#They were so good me and my brother made them and I doubled the ingredients for my family and it was so delicious I added vanilla for more flavor and it was the best recipe ever my family really liked it and I'm only 13 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#They were SO GOOD. I added a spoonful of Hershey's cocoa to the batter to make chocolate pancakes. ???? 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Fairly simple enough to follow recipe, but like others, I made a couple of changes: added more milk to make the batter a bit thinner, and a bit more sugar to compensate for the added milk. I did so after trying to make a pancake with the original recipe, and ended up with a pancake that was way overcooked on the outside and still raw on the inside. The thinner batter and lower than I would normally set temperature made for a fully cooked golden pancake. I'm just waiting for my daughter's opinion on the flavor now. ?? 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#These were excellent! To make them even fluffier, let the batter rest for about 10 minutes after you stir it up. Mmmm!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#best ever pancake I've made! I used chocolate milk, it's fluffy and delicious. 
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#I added a tsp of vanilla and blueberries and these were excellent! My kids gobbled them up!
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#sure to cook on low heat otherwise pancakes come out tasteless and burnt, other than that, great recipe!
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#I thought these pancakes were great. Tips: Make sure all your liquid/wet ingredients are at room temperature. I microwaved the milk to warm it up so that the melted butter wouldn't solidify once it was added to cold milk. For the eggs, I soaked them in hot water to bring them to room temperature then very lightly scrambled them before combining with the milk and butter. Sift the dry ingredients before mixing in the wet ingredients. Mix until combined but be careful not to overmix. 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#This was a great simple recipe but like others I did have to improvise a bit. The batter was super thick so I added about a halfcup additional milk. And I added an extra tablespoon sugar since I am American and finally a but if vanilla. Just improved it enough to make it wonderful
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#These are the best pancakes I have ever had. Although the batter is thick, if you use a measuring cup to put it on a pan it is really worth it for the fluffiness you maintain. I found this recipe a few months back and have been making it every Sunday and sometimes Saturday too!
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#tasted fantastic! I smothered mine in Easter-dinner leftover turkey, and gravy and i now understand why chicken and waffles is so popular in the States. Great 4/20 recipe for sure! 
Fluffy Pancakes#1#3#Horrible in every aspect possible. I thought I'd try a new recipe for pancakes that were a bit fluffier but the batter was absolutely worthless. 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#This is a great simple recipe. We made it exactly as written, though we did double it, feeding 3 teens and a toddler, plus mom and dad..this was the perfect amount. Batter was perfect and they cooked up light and fluffy. If you are looking for a easy basic good recipe, look no further!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#2#These pancakes were so terrible. They had absolutely no flavor even with me adding vanilla extract. The texture was fine but they tasted like nothing.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Best pancakes ever. Very fluffy. It is essential you only mix until everything is moist. Over beating will create flat pancakes. I add 1/2 tsp vanilla which I love but would still be great without!
Fluffy Pancakes#2#1#To SHEL -- these are the best. You must have beaten the batter way too much. When using baking powder you are not suppose to overbeat/mix. sounds like that was your problem. The baking powder is what makes them so fluffy. Also, you need to use a small fine mesh strainer to put the baking power through. This will break up any clumps of powder. Otherwise you will have small pockets of baking powder that taste horrible. Give it another try (do a half recipe) you'll be surprised. 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#1#The basics are okay, but if you follow the exact directions, the batter is much too thick. Adding additional milk is necessary.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#1#This was disgusting. These were flat and terrible. I followed the recipe precisely. I wish I could show you a picture of how gross these turned out. I have no idea what these other people are talking about.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Absolutely delicious. Very fluffy. Will make these pancakes over and over.
Fluffy Pancakes#2#0#Dan, on Jan 26, 2019, recommends using less baking soda. Where does he see baking soda in this recipe????
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#These were amazing! My 11 year old and I made them together, so that tells you it was pretty simple. So much better than the box and less ingredients. We added blueberries to half and chocolate chips to the other half and it was a hit for the fam (1yo, picky toddler, ambitious pre-teen). Highly recommend!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Great recipe to wake up to and eat. I recommend adding less baking soda, or replace it with baking powder, as the taste of the baking soda is a bit too strong. But this is a great recipe, especially if you add some fruit such as blueberries.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Is there such thing as too fluffy of a pancake? The batter was extremely fluffy to the point I that they would not completely cook through on the stove top and had to be finished in the oven which resulted in a flat heavy pancake once completely cooked through.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#I just made these pancakes and they were awesome, better than any prepackage mix from the store. They are more then worth the 5 stars.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#haven't done it yet, but I trust this website 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#This is by far the best pancake recipe I've found and done... it needs more than 5 stars.. I've done with cinnamon and little xtra sugar, and used chocolate milk instead of white milk but have to double up the milk if u switch, and added little vanilla extract..
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#I made this the other morning and added chocolate chips since my kids love chocolate chip pancakes and this receipe is a winner!! I will not be buying boxed pancake mix again, thanks!!!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#I've been looking online for the perfect pancake recipe. After trying several others, my family agrees THIS is the keeper! My 9 year old is about as picky as they come, and she LOVES these! Fluffy and delicious!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#I just made these for my brunch and they're really good. I added cinnamon to them but I will add chocolate chips to make them even more tasty. 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#http://5ab2f60lr54j47aiihqfj1l98y.hop.clickbank.net/
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Just made these for breakfast. Used whole wheat flour and added about 1/4 tsp almond extract.Turned out very yummy  will definitely make again.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#The only thing bad I could say, which isn't even bad at all, is to put like 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla. I always put vanilla in my pancakes so I was like ok I'll just add it in but to me pancakes are sooo much better with vanilla but it's a perfect batter and really easy to make into a perfect shape. Will use this recipe every time
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Loved it!! So fun and easy toMake. This helped me a lot. Best pancakes I ever had!!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#This is my favorite pancake recipe. Everyone loves ithem, they are so light and fluffy. I have made these many, many times and they always turn out perfect. We often add blueberries or the kids like chocolate chips.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Worst pancakes I have ever had the misfortune to eat. even my 2 and 3yo spat them out.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#These pancake are perfect to wake up to. We always double or triple the recipe so there's plenty for everyone!! 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Two words for this recipe..... YUM-MO!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#My family loved this recipe the very first time I made it...can't say that about all pancake recipes I've tried. Topped it off with a homemade strawberry syrup?? Yummy 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Very fluffy and so fast to put together. Easy to dress up with vanilla and your favorite mix ins.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Very lite pancake, better with blue berries.. I will make this again!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Love the fluffiness of this pancake. This recipe is quick and easy and very tasty!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#I made this recipe exact, I had to add more milk because the batter was so thick. Pancakes tasted better than boxed but not better than a restaurant. I will not make this recipe again
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#These were delicious and easy to throw together in a pinch! I doubled it for my family of 4.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#These had great flavor! I used mostly buttermilk because I had some to get rid of, but this is a good recipe to have when I only have milk.
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#This is one of my favorite pancake recipes. Very simple and good. I will sometimes add vanilla or lemon juice to the recipe just for something different.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#I just tried these, and they were great !. I added toasted pecans to them !
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Easy and tasty. Very similar to the pancakes my mom used to make.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Easy and simple..i love it
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#great pancake recipe. Fluffy and yummy, and all ingredients that I have on hand. I butter the skillet instead of using cooking spray to give it a slightly crisp buttery outside.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#I couldnt find my go to recipe this morning so I tried these pancakes. They are the BEST!!! I added a tsp of vanilla and used butter instead of shortening with a bit more milk, and VOILE`... they were just perfect!!! So now these are my go to pancake recipe.... Simple and Deeeeeelicious!!!!!!!!!! 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#These are fabulous! Taste like box mix, but so much better! The batter is super thick so I always add a splash more milk to thin just a bit. Still stays nice and fluffy. I love that this recipe doesn't use buttermilk like most pancake recipes because I don't always have it on hand. 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#I made these yesterday on a cold snowy New England morning. Wonderful! I agree with another reviewer that they are better than Bisquick. I'm glad I gave these a try. I will definitely make again! 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Best from scratch pancakes!!! I've been trying different recipes and this one is it, no more looking. Nice and fluffy and simple to make. 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#I think this is the recipe I used the other day. I used 3/4 c. of flour and substituted 1/4 c. of Quinoa flour for the remainder of the flour.They came out delicious and left me full of energy and a lasting feeling of fullness.I think this would make an excellent pancake for our children going off to school and their parents going off to work.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#These pancakes truly were light, fluffy, and delicious. I added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and 1 tsp vanilla to the wet ingredients. My family loves vanilla flavored pancakes. I also dropped fresh blueberries onto each pancake while the first side was cooking. I had a bit of trouble combining the melted shortening with the milk and egg. Ultimately, I heated the milk and shortening together in the microwave for about 30 seconds and then whisked them together vigorously while adding the egg. Not sure if that's the best technique, but I was pleased with the product. 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#These pancakes had excellent flavor, plus being tender and fluffy. Will definately keep this recipe to make them again.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#These pancakes were way better than Bisquick box mix. They were way fluffier and delicious! My husband and 7 year old loved them too! The best part is the ingredients are things I always have on hand too!!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Yum! I doubled the batch and added 3/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup buttermilk. Needed to add a little more milk to thin the batter. Turned out light and fluffy.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#I substituted Coconut oil for the shortening, absolutely my all time favorite pancakes. Thank You for sharing!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#My ten year old daughter really loved these pancakes! She declared them the fluffiest ever! I have to admit that I agree. They were very simple to make, and delicious!I just made them for the second time, and they were just as good as the first! So I didn't just get lucky the first time!Both times, I've doubled the recipe.***Update - 2017-05-30***These have become my go to pancake recipe for sleepover breakfasts. Several of her friends have declared them the best pancakes ever. They're so easy, and so tasty! 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#These turned out tasty. I used butter instead of shortening and changed to gluten free all-purpose flour. I also added vanilla extract and used additional milk. I am looking forward to trying different variations on these like adding fruit!
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#the pancake looked like a potatoe pancake, would not brown.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Theses are the best pancakes I have ever made! The kids and husband love them. The only thing I did to this recipe was added buttermilk just enough to make it more pourable. I have tried a lot of recipes and nothing compares to this one.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#These are the best pancakes I have ever made! I will never go back to frozen or a box again. This recipe doesn't take long at all and they turn out perfect everytime! 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Really easy to make and taste great. No more boxed mixes for me :)
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Yummy! :)
Fluffy Pancakes#1#0#Have tried these now with several substitutes for the shortening - oil, canned pumpkin, sweet potato, applesauce & cinnamon, baby food fruit purees and all work great! Very versatile! Also buttermilk makes them even fluffier. These are our go to pancakes and loved by my toddler!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#These taste great but fall apart
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Very good recipe! I used white wheat flour and coconut crystals in place of sugar. Also added vanilla and cinnamon.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Very good! I also subbed 2 T. of oil for the shortening, and it was plenty.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Awesome!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Make sure to warm up your milk and to'temper' the egg and butter so it doesn't congeal. 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#I was looking for a good pancake recipe, I used this one added not quite a teaspoon of cinnamon, a dash of ground ginger and nutmeg and 1/4 of chopped pecans, they were awesome!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#My family loves these pancakes, especially my five year old! Definitely making these again!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Great tasting pancakes. The family loved these.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#So simple to make and so delicious to eat....
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#I have been looking for a pancake recipe that my children could not get enough of. This is it. They are perfect!!!!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#My two-year-old and I really enjoyed these this morning. Only alteration I made was adding a little vanilla extract. Otherwise, we kept it simple and as is. Delicious!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#I substitute 1/4 c. canola oil for the melted shortening and it works great!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Good simple recipe
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#These are a family favorite, and they freeze really well too!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#This was the best recipe ever for pancakes! I tried one morning and the kids loved them. I just need to double the recipe this time because it was not enough last time.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Because of my sight, I am always leery about cooking certain foods; I cannot see down so I don't know if they are cooked...These pancakes were very good and a big confidence booster-Thanks! 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#This is my new favorite pancake recipe! Very few ingredients, easy to make....but so GOOD. Pancakes are super fluffly (much fluffier than the pic shows). The outside is a slightly crisp golden brown and the middle is a perfect dense cake. This will be my Sunday morning pancake recipe from now on! 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Love this recipe, very fluffy pancakes. A great way to start the day!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#i love pancakes i eat them almost everyday, sometime i will put strawberry pie filling on top, they are so good
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#YUM our girls say they are a favorite before school. Make ahead and put in the frig...
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#our favorite pancakes, wayyyy better than store mixes...my 11 yr old son makes them its that easy, and we use 1/4 c oil, and more milk
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#This was a wonderful recipe! It's light, a bit flaky, and overall delicious. I made it for my dad. He loved it and keeps asking me to make it everyday . It's so easy to make! 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#really good, i used oil also and just a little more sugar, wonderful!!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#My family loves these pancakes! We make them every Saturday and sometimes during the week as well!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Great pancakes. We added blueberries to our batter. Turned out perfect, no more buying mixes at the store for this family.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#We have tried them twice now and don't like them. 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Nice fluffy pancakes. I used oil instead of shortening and added a a little more milk and make a double batch. Turned out great. This will be my pancake mix from now. Thanks for the recipe and the tips!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#I also had to add a tad more milk, but they were great and I will make again!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Even though I had to add alot of extra milk to thin out the batter, these were the best pancakes I've made from scratch in a long time!! Thanks for posting this recipe it's going into my favorites!! 
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Delicious! Those of you who substitued oil: did 2 tbs oil replace the 1/4 cup of shortening?
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#I prepared this also for my co-workers breakfast. I add little cinammon to give a better flavour and the taste. it was really a hit. I will make this again. thank you.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#good, but super thick batter.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#These were quick and easy and by adding a little more sugar and baking powder they were sweet and fluffy. My grandson ate them right off the griddle and said homemade was better than going out! No more pancakes houses for him!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Great recipe. I would defiantly make these again.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#These are nice! I like having light pancakes.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Cooks faster than my usual recipe for pancakes. Easy to make. Big, fluffy, and tasty. Yum!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#These are wonderful pancakes!! Very easy to make as a last minute meal any time of the day. I double the batch and freeze them for my kids, they love how fluffy they are!! I will make these pancakes many more times. Thanks!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Best pancakes ever! I added a little more milk because the batter seemed to thick to pour. Big fluffy panakes, will definitely make again!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#My family loves these pancakes. They are very light and fluffy and are made of ingredients we always have on hand. We usually double the recipe and it makes about 12 larger pancakes. And we make these with 2tbsp of oil instad of the shortening, like some of the other reviewers.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Very light and fluffy. I also used 2 tbs of oil and they came out perfect!
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#Thanks for the recipe! They turned out great,and the serving size is perfect. This was what I was looking for. Thanks again.
Fluffy Pancakes#0#0#These are the BEST pancakes! I use 2 Tablespoons of oil instead of the melted shortening, and use buttermilk instead of regular. The buttermilk will make the batter VERY thick, and you will need to quickly spread it out on the griddle, but makes all the difference. You can increase the buttermilk to 1 C. to make the batter more pourable and the pancakes will still come out light and fluffy. I have also doubled the recipe with equally good results.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Amazing! I don't have five spice so I used a little ginger, cinnamon & allspice. The sauce thickened while simmering so there was no need for cornstarch. So good! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#1#2#Tasty but this recipe is too sweet so I add sugar to taste.
Asian Chicken Thighs#2#2#Top 10 fav recipe. Have made several times. Definitely use rice vinegar in place of white, as well as chili sauce in place of ketchup. The five spice is a must for fabulous flavor, (freeze spice for later repeat meals if nothing else). We do add a bit more red pepper for extra heat. Also, no need for the extra step of cornstarch slurry. Just mix that in with the rest of ingredients, and pour over chicken, and simmer 20 minutes. Oh, and double the sauce. So yummy over the rice.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Excellent! My favorite part of the chicken. However, you could easily swap out thighs for breasts if you aren't a dark meat eater. If you don't have Chinese 5 spice, a close substitute is Garam Masala. Use the same measurement. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#1#0#Very delicious. A little too spiced for my family so next time I'll cut the red pepper flakes in half. Otherwise a very easy dish to make.
Asian Chicken Thighs#1#1#This was really good! I was skeptical with the orange juice because I have had bad experiences in the past but it was delicious! Also the crushed red pepper was perfect my husband is pretty sensitive to spice and he didn't even notice! I used breasts instead of thighs just because that's what I had on hand! Excellent and easy. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#1#0#Easy and delicious! I halved the amount of crushed red peppers which was just enough spiciness for us. Next time will double the amount of sauce.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I loved this, but my husband thought it was too sweet. I'd like to try again with less sugar. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#1#Deeeelicious! A little too sweet for my wife's diabetes.. So next Im going to cut back on the sugar. And my granddaughter found it too spicy. Think I'll leave out the red chillies next time. But every one cleaned their plates. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#1#0#This was amazing! I will definitely make this again.
Asian Chicken Thighs#5#1#I made this recipe last night. It was delicious and I will make this again. The sauce is so tasty that I will try it on pork chops next. I used Swerve 0 calorie brown sugar to make this lower carb. i used rice wine vinegar instead of white vinegar and I reduced red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp which is just enough heat for me. I finally got to use my Chinese five spice! Great recipe!
Asian Chicken Thighs#1#1#I replaced the white vinegar with rice vinegar and left out the red pepper flakes. It was easy to make and will be a regular in my home menu. I think it would pair well with a ginger lime rice or something with bright flavors like that.
Asian Chicken Thighs#2#0#This recipe has become a family favorite and pairs well with sous vide cooking. The chicken thighs can be sous vide cooked for 1.5 hours at 165. They are then easily browned in a skillet, removed and the sauce added. Once the sauce comes to a boil, add the cornstarch/water mix and once the sauce thickens, put the chicken back in and serve. Cuts down on the final prep time. Love it!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#1#I have made this several times and shocked I haven't previously reviewed. I make it exactly as written which is quite unusual for me. Bone in skinless thighs are perfect for this recipe , and I highly recommend sticking to that. A close second is boneless, skinless thighs. I do not recommend chicken breasts because the texture is not a moist. Volunteer Food Editor 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I made this for my wife and I per recipe. Served over rice and with stir fried vegetables. It was great, and easy to make.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This is one of the best chicken recipes I have ever made...The balance of flavors was perfect - tangy, sweet, salty, and slightly spicy. I browned my chicken and put it in a freezer bag with the sauce so that the only thing I had to do was simmer the ingredients in a pan. Such an easy, delicious meal. This will be a new go-to meal for me.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Easy to make and my family LOVED it. Best combination you could wish for.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This is my FAVORITE chicken recipe ever! I don't typically even like chicken but this recipe I make quite often, a new staple in our family. Even my teen son LOVES the tangy- sweet perfectly balanced flavor.! A definite must try once- you'll be hooked! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I happened across this recipe a few years ago. The entire family loves it. The Chinese 5 spice gives it a distinctly Asian flavor. We like it over rice and garnished with green onion. It is a meal in itself.
Asian Chicken Thighs#1#0#This was amazing! I made it for my mom's birthday tonight and she loved it too. I did not have the Chinese 5 spice but it came out great anyways. The sauce reminds me of the General Tso's sauce (which I love!) I will definitely make this again. We were craving some Asian food but with being in lock down due to the Covid virus we don't venture out except for groceries, so this HIT the spot!!! I will be sharing the link to this with my family and friends! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I love Asian flavors and this recipe did not disappoint. I followed the recipe but I did substitute Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet Red Chili sauce for the ketchup. I just don't care for ketchup except on fries or meatloaf...LOL. I will add some fresh pineapple chunks and maybe some sweet peppers for texture next time but overall, this is a keeper as written! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This is perhaps one of my most favorite recipes. The flavor is outstanding...and the leftovers are so versatile! I use the leftover chicken in my homemade fried rice. I double the recipe and quadruple the sauce.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This is an awesome recipe! flavors are right on...I would double the sauce recipe next time I make it, so there is more to put on the rice. I didn't have Chinese five-spice, so I looked it up and made my own... 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#yummy, yummy. Used boneless, skinless thighs. Didn't have 5-spice. Turned out great and will make again. Thanks for the recipe. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#3#Like some of the other reviewers, I was missing a few ingredients. Didn't have any chicken so we used hamburger, didn't have any orange juice so I used tomato juice, didn't have reduced sodium soy sauce so used regular soy sauce, didn't have any Chinese five spice powder so I found five spices in my cabinet and use them instead, didn't have any rice so used linguine. All in all, it was a truly wonderful recipe and my family will enjoy Asian chicken thighs on a regular basis from now on. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I have made this dish several times and I think it gets better each time. I use BS thighs, omit the green onions and double the sauce. We love wings, I may try those next.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Made this last night and it was fabulous! Even my guy, who has never eaten chicken thighs and did not want to, loved it and rated about it. I did not have the 5-spice or the red pepper flakes but substituted some chili power and extra black pepper and it was still great. We dont like really spicy foods so next time I may add 1/2 the red papper flakes or a dash of the 5-spice if I can find it to see if that changes anything. This is just great and I am adding to my rotation recipe list!!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#My absolute favorite when I want oriental food at home! I always double the sauce and usually have it over cauliflower rice instead of long-grain.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This was so good!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#The best sauce ever!! I enjoy trying lots of recipes and trying to find good recipes for all cuts of chicken. I will use this recipe from now on for thighs. I am also thinking about trying it for wings.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#We had these delicious chicken thighs tonight and cleaned our plates. I followed the recipe exactly but did use Splenda brown sugar. That was the only change. These are delicious and so easy to prepare. We will definitely be having this again. Volunteer Field Editor
Asian Chicken Thighs#1#0#I tripled the sauce, using orange juice rather than water and adding 1 more tbls. of white vinegar, for 2.5 lbs. skinless, boneless chicken breasts...but totally forgot to add the brown sugar! It was still delicious. I will make again just to remember to add the brown sugar.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#1#I thought the sauce was delicious. I used bone-in chicken breasts because I don't really like thighs, and I think this was a mistake. I did not really care for the texture of the breast meat cooked this way. I would strongly recommend sticking with thighs.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Very good recipe. I used chicken breasts as that was all I had. I also did not have the five-spice powder. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. Very tasty. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I followed the recipe, but doubled the meat and tripled the sauce. I used chicken breasts plus thighs and it turned out beautifully red and so delicious. You could skip browning the meat because I don't think this could be less attractive or delicious. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Delicious, although I didn't have/make 5-spice seasoning, but it was still excellent. Also, I used 1/3 cup orange juice instead of water for extra flavor. It's a keeper! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#What a hit! I doubled the sauce, and I was glad I did, as it was delicious. Will be making again.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#very good and easy!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Excellent and easy
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#So amazing! Loved it, down to the last drop of the delicious sauce. A new family favorite. I too used apple cider vinegar because I love the depth of flavor it adds.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Incredible! Doubled the sauce. Left out the 5 spice powder , did not have any. I will make this often. So happy and impressed with how it turned out! Thank you for a Great Recipe!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Make a double batch at least. These are super yummy. Making extra sauce would be a good idea also.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Very good. I halved the red pepper but it still had quite a bite, so go easy on the red pepper if you're not a heat lover. I did double the sauce and will definitely do that again next time.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I made this last night. It was ok but it sure didn't look like the picture. My sauce wasn't red in color at all. It was more of a yellowish color. It might have been because I didn't have the Chinese five spice. So maybe that is what gives it the color. It wasn't bad tasting but I thought it needed something else. We did have it over rice. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#1#0#Wonderful. I added pineapple tibits to the sauce cut up the chicken mixed with rice. Wow chicken Asian bowl...
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Made with boneless chicken thighs and cooked them first in my sous vide and then followed recipe exactly. DEE licious! Picky husband raved about the wonderful flavor. He even asked for leftovers in his lunch tomorrow. ;)
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Awesome chicken dish. I used boneless chicken thighs and followed the recipe otherwise. It was so tender, and the sauce was magnificent! This is going on my definitely make again list. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Delicious! Made just like recipe except for the Chinese 5-spice since I do not have this. Will definitely make it again!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Recipes looks delicious & appreciate the helpful recommendations from other cooks. Although, this has to be the most unattractive photograph of a dish I've seen in a long time. Looks bad, tastes good . 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Delicious, I used cider vinegar . Janet. VFE
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I loved this chicken! It was delicious and very simple to make! My son and daughter also loved it. Unfortunately my hubby didn't like it, so may not be able to make again until he goes out of town! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Easy to make. Omitted the five-spice because I didn't have it on hand, but still very good! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Family love it! Super easy and yummy! Next time I will try it with chicken breast as that is what my family prefers.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I made this recipe for my family and they truly enjoyed it. I doubled sauce recipe and paired the chicken with an Asian medley of veggies and some rice. I also did not include the 5 spice powder, but it still turned out great. My son has already requested that I make this again next week.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This recipe is fantastic and easy to make. I served Asian Peanut coleslaw with it.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This is a great recipe! Bone in chicken thighs are always on sale and this is a great way to use them. My family loves this dish . I serve these with Mushroom Fried Rice recipe from the TOH site.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This recipe was very good. We are trying to eat low-carb, therefore, I didn't make the rice. I did double the sauce, which wasn't really necessary without the rice, but we enjoyed it. I also omitted the Chinese five-spice powder, as I didn't have any on hand. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Very tasty chicken. Will definitely make again and maybe next time I will remember to put the green onions on top. Didn't miss them but will definitely try to remember to add them next time. Very easy to put together. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Very good easy recipe! I used chicken breasts and did not add the five spice powder and it was still very good! I plan on making these again. I loved the sweet flavor!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I made exactly according to recipe, except doubled sauce. As he was eating, hubby kept telling me how good it was. Perfect amount of red pepper flakes. I would maybe not double the five spice powder. Will definitely make again. Served over brown rice.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Very good, only thing I would do different is add a tad more OJ for more orange flavor and instead of scallions on top I added toasted sesame seeds
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken was delicious! This was an easy meal to prepare and I will make it again and again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I've made this many times over the past few years and it's a hit. My family loves this! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This recipe it was amazing, as is! I doubled the sauce recipe, and then added it to a crockpot for a few hours just because I ended up having people eating at different times. Next time I will double the recipe for a family of five. Even my picky kids gobbled them down! The chicken just fell off the bones. The sweet and sour and spices were just perfect. I was worried the pepper flakes would make it too spicy, but it just added the right amount of flavor. My kids want me to make this again!
Asian Chicken Thighs#1#0#I used boneless pork chops instead. The recipe was so easy and delicious. I served it alongside Chinese-style rice. Yum!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Can only say wonderful! Only change made was lime juice instead of orange juice, doubled the sauce and truly enjoyed!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Smells awesome! Cant wait to try it! Thats was great. I tripled the recipe so there was decent amount of sauce. I think boneless would end up dry just dont eat the skin
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This was good and we enjoyed the flavor, but I would use boneless skinless chicken thighs next time and perhaps double the sauce ingredients as there wasn't much sauce. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Did any one even try this recipe as is for the first time. I think it is good just the way it is except perhaps for those who don't like it so spicy....use a bit less red pepper flakes. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#1#0#Nice effort for the recipe. Lilliamarai, Try the real Asian version. Just a little twist from this recepi.Use lime juice (2tblspoon) instead of orange juice. Ommit tomato sauce. Substitude with tamarind juice (2tblspoon) if you did not use lime juice at all. Before you fry the chicken with corn oil, oat it with 1teaspoon of tumeric powder 1teaspoon of salt. When chicken is done, scoop out the chicken. Use the same oil to cook the sauce. Remember to season the sauce with salt & sugar (up to you). Put the chicken into the sauce and stir a while. The sauce should be sweet & spicy. There are many version of Asian style. This is one of the simple ones. Hope you'll enjoy Asian food. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This is a great Asian dish. You can use the sauce with chicken, beef or pork. Add more red pepper flakes for Gen Tso of add sesame seeds for sesame chicken. Thank you so much for the recipe.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I made this for supper. My husband said he liked it but frankly I did not. I will not be making this again.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Quick, easy, and quite tasty. If you are going to make 5 or 6 thighs, I would at least double the sauce especially if you are going to serve with/over rice. I served with Asian fried cabbage and plain(no meat) fried rice. Was all very easy and very good.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I thought this was very good, even though it was a little too spicy for my daughter. I doubled the sauce ingredients, and was glad that I did.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Both my husband and I really liked chicken, I will make this again and add it to mylist of best chicken
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Made exactly as the recipe reads and it was delicious! This one is a keeper! My husband said I could make it again any time.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I'm confused. This recipe was under low carb but is far from low carb. Was this misfiled on the site? 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Easy and tasty. Everyone loved it and will make again.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This was great. My husband went back for thirds....then asked if he could have the last bit of chicken still left too! Served with a side of sugar snap peas and fresh fruit.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Really good chicken! I followed the recipe exactly except I reduced the red pepper flakes by half since my husband doesn't like spicy foods. The sauce was a little greasy, next time I will pour off the grease before adding the sauce and will double the sauce as other reviewers suggested. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Phenomenal! The sauce was very good and spiced just right with just a little bit of zing with the hot pepper. We used Penzey's Chinese Five Spice Powder. We did not use but a pinch as Penzey's tends to be very potent. We will definitely make this dish again!We served this over rice noodles which grabbed the sauce and coated them just perfect! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#My preschool aged children and husband liked this recipe. I doubled the sauce ingredients and made 6 thighs. I did not need the cornstarch to thicken the sauce.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#The only changes I made were using rice vinegar and omitting the 5 spice powder and cornstarch. As others commented, it thickened up fine without it. I also doubled the sauce, which is a MUST to pour over the rice! Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Made this tonight for dinner. Followed recipe exactly . It was delicious ! Served it with Khorr Assian rice& sides and fresh fruit. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Excellent, my family enjoys it a lot. I too leave out the 5 spice powder. I use orange juice concentrate for the orange juice and I have no problem with it thickening up on its own. I did try cubing the chicken once, but I thought it was better when I didn't. I don't know what is so expensive about this recipe as mentioned in a previous post. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Although I haven't made this yet but one very similar--many of you say you can't find the 5-spice seasoning. I have use it for 20 years and find it either in the normal spice section or the oriental and Spanish food sections of the grocery stores. Stores I purchased from (eastern US) Harris Teeter, Whole Foods, Kroger, and oriental market stores. Brands were McCormick (recent), W-F's 365, Badia & Goya in the Hispanic section. It's a better buy in the oriental and Hispanic sections. Also, the ingredients vary slightly, so read them an choose according to your personal tastes.Hope this helps! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Excellent & fast! After reading the reviews, I doubled the sauce ingredients. I didn't have the Chinese 5-spice powder, so substituted Chinese cinnamon. Also, we don't care for the dark meat of poultry, so I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. It was wonderful. The only suggestion my family made was to cube the chicken. I served it with wide rice noodles. Delicious! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I made this and it was really, really good. I was missing the chinese 5 spice but found it at Amazon and have it on order.I tried it again this time with the chinese 5 spice. Let me tell you right off that chinese 5 spice is overwhelmingly potent. Next time I make it I'm only going to give a sprinkling of the spice.3/25/17 - I made it again tonight and left the chinese 5 spice out completely. I didn't have orange juice so I used lemon juice plus a lot of garlic. It turned out so good. I cannot rave more about the deliciousness of this recipe. Oh yes, I added 1/2 cup green pepper and 1/4 cup chopped carrots. Just stir everything in the chicken and sauce recipe together, cover and let simmer for 30 mins. Delicious. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I added chopped red onions & fresh minced gingerroot. So yummy! Would have liked more sauce for rice though.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Everyone loved this recipe --I cooked as directed added it to the crockpot until i was finished with the rest of dinner. Served over rice and broccoli on the side. Next time i will brown the meat and add to crock pot t finish cooking. I want to add orange zest next time as Sharon said she did.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I made enough to serve 15 and not a drop was left! It was a huge hit with everyone. They were already requesting that I make it again for them! Made me feel Fantastic : )
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Really Good! The whole family loves this dish. I did triple the recipe as other reviewers mentioned because I was cooking 6 thighs but only used 2-1/2 times the amount of brown sugar. It was perfect. Thickened on it's own. Didn't need the cornstarch. I cooked it in the morning to the point of adding sauce and simmering for 15 minutes. Let it cool down and refrigerated then cooked for the rest of the cooking time just before dinner. I didn't use the five spice and it was great without it. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#1#0#So Good! I had to use chicken legs and wings because it is what I had, and I did not skin them. But other then that I fallowed the recipe as is except in the end, I didnt need the cornstarch, it had cooked down and thickened so well on its own that no more thickening was needed. Someone posted about keeping this handy in the fridge, I agree 100%. Never again will I purchase teriyaki sauce. I can see this sauce replacing several I keep on hand, and I can see using it in oh so many various ways, to many to mention. Thank you Mr. Dave Farrington, of Midwest City, Oklahoma for this recipe. Best recipe of this nature I have found to date.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This was absolutely a hit!! The orange juice and the red pepper flakes made it so! I also added some fresh orange zest to the pot, and I'm looking forward to sharing this with other friends and family! Don't like the kick? just use less! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This recipe rivals any Chinese restaurant. Made with boneless chicken thighs and served on a bed of rice and oriental steamed veggies. Amazing. Definitely double the sauce, it is that good. No need to thicken.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#The whole family enjoyed this simple dish. I used boneless, skinless chicken breast cut into cubes and served it over quinoa with broccoli florets as a side.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Amazing - had it with mashed potatoes and oh boy, it was a true hit!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I skipped the skillet part and just baked the whole thing in the oven. Really good, we all liked it!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Absolutely wonderful!!! Will definitely make again!!!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#The flavor was delicious and perfect with brown rice and some veggies.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Enjoyed this!!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Excellent recipe. Will make over and over again.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#4 thumbs up in my house!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I love this recipe. It is quick and is so yummy.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This was good, but I made it with 1 pound of cubed boneless pork, a sliced yellow onion, a sliced green bell pepper, and a sliced yellow bell pepper. I tripled the sauce ingredients except for the brown sugar (which I doubled). I let it simmer for 10 minutes instead of 30 because of the meat cube size. We had enough sauce for our rice too.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Have done this recipe twice and both times it was a BIG hit! I did this for a small group, about 30, young adults working our church'Sports Camp' and they loved it. I did it again for the O.W.L.S. (Older Wiser Loving Saints) at church and many asked for the recipe. I couldn't find the Chinese five spice powder so we didn't use it but it had a great taste. Thank you for these wonderful recipes. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Just made this two nights ago, and I'm making it again already! SO good. Better than chinese take-out and super easy. I had everything but the chinese five spice powder, so I substituted a spoon of hoison sauce like another member recommended and it was fantastic! I can't wait for dinner tonight. Ha ha. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Excellent. I used the juice of a whole orange instead of the 1/3 cup water.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I was really surprised by how much I liked this! I usually have a thing about eating meat off the bone; while I started my dinner carving off the chicken, I quickly progressed to picking the thigh up for some seriously un-lady-like gnawing. It's that good.My picky-eaters (9 and 12) ate it slowly, but didn't complain, which is highly unusual for a new flavor. I will be making this again (and again and again....) 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Very moist chicken and tasty too! I used orange marmelade instead of orange juice. I did use the corn starch. My family loves a thick sweet sauce. This sauce would be great as an'orange chicken' meal or to use for stir fry. The pineapple mentioned sounds like a good idea. Will have to try next time. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I always prefer to use chicken thighs over chicken breasts because they are much more flavorful and moist-this recipe did not disappoint! I like a lot of vegetables, so I added some sautéed green pepper and red onion strips. It was a tad more spicy than I am used too, so I added a can of crushed pineapple with the juice, and this cut back on the heat! Otherwise, this recipe will definitely be at the front of my box, especially since my husband enjoyed it!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#DH loved this. it was flavorful without being overly spicy. I also omitted the thickening step and did not miss it.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I thought we would love this and was surprised that we didn't . The chicken was moist and well cooked in the stated time, but the sauce was too sweet, and the consistency of it was very unappealing. I will probably not make this again. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I get requests for this once a week. I use boneless and skinless thighs and have to cook about 6 pounds at a time. If you bake the chicken then drain 1/2 the juice/broth for best results
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I will definitely make this again. I had four thighs instead of five. I won't use as much olive oil next time. I didn't have green onions but had everything else. I also agree that the cornstarch step wasn't really necessary although I did it to see what the results would be.Update: I have made this recipe several times over the past couple years. It is one of my favorites. I usually make brown rice to go with it and steamed veggies such as broccoli or green beans. I also agree that doubling the sauce is a good idea. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Made this today and it was delicious.Like the others, no need to thicken the sauce. Think I will double the sauce next time.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#My teenage granddaughter made this with me and we both loved it! Same experience as others, though, that no thickeing was needed. Sauce simmered down to thickness without cornstarch. We will definitely make it again.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Delicious! The 5-spice powder is optional but really does add to the flavor. I found that the sauce simmered down enough that I didn't need to thicken it with cornstarch. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Yummy. I thought there was lots of sauce, l didn't thicken it though. I would use half the amount of oil in the future. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This is an excellent recipe! I did double the sauce, because we like to have extra to dip our egg rolls. I didn't have orange juice but actually prefer orange rum in a few other Asian recipes, and it was perfect in this. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. This is definitely a keeper, but when I make it in the future, I will make a popcorn style chicken, by dipping chunks of chicken in egg white and dusting with corn starch and frying until crisp and golden and then following the rest of the recipe. This will be just like the chicken you find at a mall food court or chinese buffet. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Wonderful! I didn't have any Chinese five-spice powder so I added a spoonful of Hoisin Sauce. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I made this for the first time and me and my boyfriend loved it. I will be adding it to my go-to recipes.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#made it for the first time tonight and really liked it! The only thing I will do different the next time is double the sauce and thickener, cover the pan for about the first 15 minutes, add the cornstarch mix, and then leave the pan uncovered for the final 15 minutes. That might leave enough sauce to put on rice.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I followed the recipe and did not like the flavor. My true test whether to make a recipe again is ask the family how they liked it. When they reply, it was ok , that translates to me as don't make again. I really did want to like this recipe...sorry:( 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Have no doubt.......this is really, really good! I served with rice and stir fried baby bok choy with radishes. Yum!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This was definitely a winnder and a hit! It was so good that I licked the plate cleaned!!! Kudos.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I love this recipe. I make it all the time. I made it completely following the recipe the first time and loved it. From then on, I added my own twists. I cook the chicken in a pan first to get a good golden crust on it, then throw in some onions and the garlic from the recipe. Let that cook and then throw in the sauce for the recipe. I allow that to cook on its own for a bit then add the chicken and let that finish cooking. Then serve. Also, I felt the sauce was a little sweet for my taste so instead of ketchup, I used Kochu Jeng. Add a little lime on top and it's so good! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Love this recipe. A lot of flavour and taste just as good as a leftover!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This chicken is SHOCKINGLY good. I'm usually a white meat kinda girl but had thighs that I needed to cook. I happened to have all the ingredients and ta-da... its to die for. I didn't change a thing. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This is one of the best dishes I have ever made!!!! My boyfriend really enjoyed it and has asked me to make it again already and we only just had it two nights ago! It's will definitely be a regular dish where he is such a picky eater! Definitely one of my favorites! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I thought this was good and will make it again, but I thought the flavor needed something more...maybe I'll add the Asian chili sauce like was suggested. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This is SO good! I doubled the sauce, and that was perfect.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#v ery good flavor! I used boneless chicken breasts and cooked them in the crockpot for 5 hours. A definite keeper. Thanks for the recipe.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#great flavor - but double the sauce. I actually made it in a crockpot. delicious.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#dynamite combination of flavors! only changes i made were adding chili garlic paste and sauteed onion. topped each serving with extra chili garlic sauce. excellent served with sauteed napa cabbage! this is a keeper!!!!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This recipe was a great introduction to the Asian Five Spice Powder. It seems to add so many great flavors that I could never seem to capture.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#very tasty will use chicken breasts
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I found this recipe over a year ago. My family loves it. I even keep the sauce recipe handy to use with a teriyaki salmon we make...it's better than from a bottle. Yum! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#The family loves this recipe. I use boneless chicken thighs and add asian chili sauce and double the sauce. Also add onions.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#My family loved this recipe. I made it less than a week ago and am making it again because it was such a hit.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Made this for a lodge dinner for 50. Substituted chicken hindquarters for thighs because I needed a real he-man main dish. Doubled the sauce. Nothing but raves from both men and women. A keeper for sure.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I've been making this for a while. It's a keeper! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#The family loved this. My husband suggested using chicken breast next time.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Very good! My 9 year old even liked it, said it was a keeper!!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#excellent, i used boneless, skinless chicken thighs
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Delicious and very easy to prepare! I used boneless chicken thighs and that sped up the cooking time a bit.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#A huge hit with my picky kids.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Made this for my family and they wouldn't stop raving! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#I made this last night with boneless chicken thighs. Doubled the sauce. Added asian chili sauce (we like things spicy in our family). Didn't cook as long since there was no bone. (Didn't do the cornstarch/water at end. It was already thickened). Served with stir fried vegetables and asian noodles. The family LOVED it. There was not a piece of chicken left! Definitely a new favorite! 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#So so so so good. I used rice vinegar instead of white vinegar and used frozen concentrated orange juice. I also made my own Chinese 5 spice powder with equal parts of ground cloves, ground fennel, ground anise, cinnamon, and black pepper.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This was so easy to make - the kitchen smelled heavenly and the end result was ever so good. This will go in my frequent flyer recipe book for sure!
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Out standing. Great flavors. Thanks.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This has become a favorite dish in my household.  I make egg foo yong casserole along with it as a great companion side dish.  The whole house smells wonderful and my son can't wait for dinner...lol. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This is a hit everytime i make it. I've given it to my sister who now also makes it often. We both sometimes use chicken breasts instead of thighs. 
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#Awesome!! Better than take-out!!You can also cook it in the oven instead of on the stove top. I marinate the chicken thighs and bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, uncovered. Baste occasionally and stir in the cornstarch mixture with 15 minutes left in the cooking time.
Asian Chicken Thighs#0#0#This is one of our very favorite recipes. We like to double the sauce ingredients and serve fresh steamed broccoli on the side.
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#Made to take to work, everyone loved them.
Pumpkin Bars#3#0#These bars are what pumpkin bars should be!! delicious and moist. I chilled them several hours before serving them. I plan on making them again for the upcoming holidays.
Pumpkin Bars#3#0#These bars are a family favorite and I've been making them for years! I like to add raisins or chocolate chips. 
Pumpkin Bars#2#0#I made these today.  They were like a moist cake, not what I would consider bars. Flavor was very balanced. Not strong pumpkin and not strong cinnamon. Definitely chill before serving to firm up the bake. I will probably use a different cream cheese frosting recipe with less sugar. First pumpkin of the season and these were a gentle start. I've never made a Taste of Home recipe that wasn't good.  
Pumpkin Bars#23#16#After they are cooled and frosted, did you refrigerate them, or only what you have left over? I'm making them for an event tomorrow and can't decide whether to frost them and refrigerate, or leave them out on the counter and frost tomorrow? 
Pumpkin Bars#13#3#A crowd pleaser! Moist and delicious. I'm a sucker for Pumpkin SPICE, so I added 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp ground clove. Great with or without nuts. But I couldn't resist folding in 1 cup toasted pecans. 
Pumpkin Bars#5#1#The whole family loves these.
Pumpkin Bars#15#4#This recipe is great! I did substitute applesauce for the oil. And I added some miniature chocolate chips to my second batch. My sister that doesn't cook at all made them and they turned out wonderful. Everyone loves them!
Pumpkin Bars#9#3#I've been making this for years. Perfect recipe and family favorite. The only thing I am doing different is substituting 2 cups of fresh roasted pureed pumpkin. Out of this world! 
Pumpkin Bars#13#9#This is a great recipe, bulletproof for swaps and adds. Not to be that guy but I swapped half the flour for almond flour and used splenda instead of sugar (use half the amount of splenda that the recipe calls for or you'll be sorry...). Then I added walnuts and cranberries and a scoop of PB2. 
Pumpkin Bars#17#0#Killer recipe! Right amount of everything! Made to raise money for our American Legion on their spaghetti night. Not a crumb left!
Pumpkin Bars#9#1#I have been making these for about 40 years!! So easy,moist,now my Daughter makes them.
Pumpkin Bars#12#0#Excellent recipe! Need to convert all my recipes to gluten free due to allergy. This worked wonderfully for that! Used GF flour, 1 tsp. Xanthan gum, and 1/4 cup sour cream (added for the fat to help GF flour work more efficiently). Otherwise, no changes! Great texture, taste, and appeal! Thanks for posting this recipe!
Pumpkin Bars#9#2#I made these for Thanksgiving a few years ago with great success! I used melted, unsalted butter in lieu of the oil in the cake. This recipe is perfect if you know how to follow simple instructions and use the right size pan. The frosting was just right and the cake was light, moist and fluffy. It was a huge hit! Thanks T.O.H!
Pumpkin Bars#3#1#I love these bars I make them every fall at the request of my kids and cousins. My Mom always made these for me and my sister when we were growing up and well into our adulthood. A true staple of the season.
Pumpkin Bars#2#55#The bar itself was nice and moist. It had great flavor. I was disappointed with the frosting. There wasn't enough fir good coverage of the pan and it didn't stick to the bar. Next time I will buy a can of frosting. Expected better from Taste of Home.
Pumpkin Bars#8#17#I'm going with for stars ONLY because these turn out more of a pan bread or cake not bars. Amazing flavor in the cake and icing!
Pumpkin Bars#7#0#Moist and delicious. Best ever pumpkin bars.
Pumpkin Bars#18#2#I msde this minus canola oil, using 1 cup of homemade applesauce. It is moist and delicious beyond belief!
Pumpkin Bars#34#3#I don't know where this recipe originated, but I double checked, its EXACTLY the same one I have been making for forty years! It's moist, it's delicious. Some folks have commented that it's not chewy. No, it's not. It's not supposed to be. It's not exactly a cake either. It cuts into neat bars, my family loves them. I bake it in a 10x15 x 1 pan, it comes out perfectly. The only thing I add is a pinch of cloves. Delicious and reliable.
Pumpkin Bars#4#0#These were probably the best thing I've ever made, and I'm a big baker. I used about 1/3 more cinnamon, 1/3 less oil, and baked about 5 minutes longer...but ovens do vary. Delish!
Pumpkin Bars#4#0#I BAKE ALL THE TIME AND THE KIDS ARE ALWAYS ASKING ME FOR SOMETHING. I TRIED THESE AND NOW I HAVE A NEW MOST REQUESTED DESERT. THANKS FOR THE WONDERFUL AND EASY TO MAKE DESSERT . SO MOIST.. SIMPLY DELICIOUS !!! 
Pumpkin Bars#3#0#I added pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. I had a hard time getting it done all the way. I thin next time I will only add half of the oil. A cup seems like way too much.
Pumpkin Bars#3#1#This recipe is fantastic!! The cake part was very moist and thick. The frosting was delicious and not too sweet! My sister loved it and she's not even a fan of pumpkin! 10/10 recommend
Pumpkin Bars#3#1#I made these to take to visit a sick family member and was pretty disappointed by the lack of flavor in the bars themselves. They definitely need spices other then just cinnamon and I regretted not adding ground cloves, ginger, and nutmeg but I wanted to make the recipe exactly as shown. The frosting was good but was the only flavor you could taste.
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#Great. Moist. Everyone liked them.
Pumpkin Bars#2#1#I LOVE IT!!!! I shared it with my neighbors. I'll definitely make it again. :) 
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#a very moist cake and with canned pumpkin I always keep this in my pantry for a quick make any time of year
Pumpkin Bars#5#0#If I was just reviewing the bars without the frosting, I would give this 5 stars. They are so good. I baked mine in a 15 x 10 pan per the recipe, and had to make extra frosting, as there was not enough to cover the top (even with a very thing layer). 6 oz. of cream cheese is a strange amount. I used the whole 8 oz. brick, and added the proportion of powdered sugar and milk needed to finish topping the bars. I wonder if there's a typo in the recipe? Should it be 6 oz. of cream cheese, or should it have been 16 oz? Would have been plenty of frosting (maybe too much) for a 9x13 using 6 oz, but not enough for the 15x10. 
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#Easy and always a crowd-pleaser!
Pumpkin Bars#4#2#These bars were the so delicious! They were super easy to make and so quick because the measurements were easy. I made it exactly as the recipe called for and they came out light and fluffy; not exactly like cake but cakey. All of my kids raced and raced about them??
Pumpkin Bars#9#4#Can you make this with applesauce instead of oil?
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#I have been making this for over 30 years.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Made these for a reunion and everyone loved them!
Pumpkin Bars#1#2#Made in a cake pan I cut 1/3 cup sugar and split the 1 1/3 cup sugar 50/50 brown and granulated . I also substituted half of the oil with applesauce and added 1/2 teaspoon of ginger. 1/4 tsp of clove and 1/8 of nutmeg . I made the icing exactly to the recipe. 4 solid stars as a cake but I think it would be 5 as a bar. I will make again.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#SO delicious! I made these last night and brought them to work, they were gone in about an hour.
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#So delicious. Taste as good as they look.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I have made this recipe for the past three years and have made several adjustments. Instead of sugar I have use Truvia cane sugar blend which only requires 1/2 the amount of sugar and has 75% fewer calories than regular sugar. I also used 3 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice as suggested in other reviews plus an extra sprinkle or two. When I make this in a 11X15 pan I make a recipe and a half so they do not come out thin. Or I use a 9 X13 pan and bake for 30 - 35 minutes. Instead of cream cheese frosting I just use a can of coconut pecan frosting instead.
Pumpkin Bars#1#1#I am giving these 5 stars and havent even made them yet. I make something similar using three jars of baby food carrots in place of pumpkin (and 1/4 cup more oil) and they are to die for! (They are probably a brighter orange than pumpkin bars) I bake them in a sheet cake pan, which makes them more like bars. I also use the whole 8 oz of cream cheese and a whole stick of butter in the icing, sticking to the 2 cups of sugar, which means that they would be slightly less sweet. The frosting just covers them.To the person who asked about a substitute for cannola oil, you can use any kind of oil except for olive. My favorite is safflower oil, but I warn you that it is expensive. I love it in salad dressings and have used it in my carrot bars. It is very light..
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#What can I substitute for the canola oil?
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#These were delicious! I added 1 tsp vanilla to the batter and I used 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. I did not add dates or nuts. I baked it for about 18 min. Everyone loved them!
Pumpkin Bars#2#2#Made this for the first time last night. Everyone thought it was like pumpkin pie but better. Also. Frosting recipe is a keeper. Will not buy premade anymore. I did split this up into two smaller baking dishes, since I didn't have a big one available. It took 20 mins each, the batter was about an inch high, but rose into a cake. I would suggest that if the recipe is not changed it is called pumpkin cake instead of bars. Fortunately I found that I prefer the cake! 
Pumpkin Bars#3#1#Long before the internet, my Mom cut this recipe out of a magazine. That's over 40 years ago. I've been using it forever. Last year, I typed the recipe from Mom's clipping and combined two lines. This morning, I pulled the recipe from my computer and it was wrong. 1 2/3 cup oil and no sugar. I looked on Taste of Home and there it was. One cup oil and 1 2/3 cups sugar. This recipe is WONDERFUL. Just the right amount of sweetness and well worth being available for more than 40 years. BTW, I add raisins to the batter and chopped walnuts sprinkled on the frosting. 
Pumpkin Bars#2#0#My family loves these I have to make them every Thanksgiving
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#Yummy alternative for people like me who don't like pumpkin pie.Recipe is too sweet though. I halved the sugar for the bars and added more cream cheese to the icing. Plus I did half wholewheat flour which I may do only wholewheat flour next time. Also, I may reduce the amount of oil next time or use butter as they seemed a bit weighed down by oil. Still though super yummy! 
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#Easy, great go-to dessert. I add raisins and my family loves it.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#This bar was wonderful and the whole family loved it. I added dark raisins and just a touch of pumpkin spice.
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#These were a huge hit in my house. Really good!
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#My favorite! Soooo good!
Pumpkin Bars#2#1#Followed recipe as written. Not enough pumpkin flavor. More like cake than bars. Probably won't make again. 
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#I have a recipe that's very similar to this one AND I always use applesauce in place of oil in ALL my recipes! Also, I use a cookie sheet instead of a cake pan and 325 oven for almost 1 hour. It's always awesome! 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Very good Recipe! Everyone loves these bars. I tweaked it by adding Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of cinnamon, and have used 8 Oz Cream Cheese in frosting.....yum!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Excellent!! I am going to add some walnuts or pecans next time making these scrumptious bars! Thanks for recipe!
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#Good basic cake. But I don't care for oily foods. So I added another 3/4cup of pumpkin and only a 1/4 cup of butter.. as we all knoweverything is better with butter! I also added a tsp of vanilla, 1/4 tspnutmeg, dash of ground cloves. If you use a 15x10 pan it's a bar andmight want to check prior to the bake time stated. 9x13 pan is a cake& will take longer to bake since it's thicker. Remember you shouldonly take bake times stated as a estimate of time needed. Rule ofthumb... EVERY OVEN IS DIFFERENT....AND TOOTH PICKS NEVER LIE.Always check it a little earlier then time called for- say 5 to 8 minutes.And lastly think about what ratio is called for in a recipe before youstart mixing it. You can catch misprints etc. before it's in the ovenand to late to fix if you think about what you're mixing. 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#These pumpkin bars are a constantly requested dessert for work, home & bake sales. Moist, flavorful, I do use my own recipe for the frosting, but the bars are delicious!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Best-tasting bars ever! They're only bars, cuz they turn out that way if you cut them right, but the taste is wonderful! I used regular Betty Crocker cream cheese icing. Didn't have time to make my own, and they were a huge hit at Thanksgiving! Now I make it every year for a 2nd dessert at Christmas time. 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#disappointed :( (these are) NOT bars, this is a recipe for cake!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Very moist & delicious. More like a cake than a bar.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Great, easy recipe to make! These tasted excellent and were not dry at all.
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#Very disappointed , they are dry & I only baked them 28 minutes & they do not have a lot of pumpkin flavor, need something added to them, maybe nuts & more pumpkin flavor & more spices, will not make them again.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I would like to know if these will freeze well. Thanks
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#These are absolutley delicious and a really easy recipe to follow. My mom used to make pumkin bars every fall and I always looked forward to it as a kid. My mom has sinced passed away and i couldn't find the recipe for them. I stumbled upon this one and it tastes exactly like the kind she used to make. I will definetely use this recipe over and over! 
Pumpkin Bars#1#1#These pumpkin bars are so good! When I made them though I used 2 cups of fresh sugar pie pumpkin from my garden instead of canned pumpkin. I think it tastes so much better with fresh pumpkin and it is also organic and environmentally friendly.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I got this recipe from a Taste of Home site over 10 years ago. It is a family favorite and often requested. So easy to put together, only change I have made is a little more spice. I add some nutmeg and a pinch of clove. Great anytime of year.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I have made these bars since the recipe was published in the Country Magazine back in 1993. I am always asked to make the recipe for gatherings and to make MORE!!! They are moist and delicious.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#My family loved these pumpkin bars!
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#This recipe was so easy to make. The family thought it was great!
Pumpkin Bars#1#1#I made this cake last night as my son has been requesting a pumpkin based dessert. I'm not a big fan of pumpkin pie, so decided to try this instead. This turned out fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly. What I like about this cake is that it's not overly sweet. The frosting was easy to make. I didn't have a whole 8oz pack of cream cheese, only about half left over. I made the frosting with that. It turned out great. The frosting was a thin layer due to my shortage of cream cheese, but it was just fine.I am not a baker, but this was a very easy recipe to follow. I might add pumpkin seeds or sun flower seeds with raisins to it next time. 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Amazing!!! Very moist. I used Cool Whip Cream Cheese Frosting, but sadly they have discontinued it.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I have made these for years. They are so simple and always moist and delicious! I Follow the recipe exactly and they always get rave reviews and want the recipe! If your in a hurry a can of cream cheese frosting works well also!
Pumpkin Bars#0#1#We made these with our own home grown pumpkin - in March. In place of the cup of oil we used 1/3 cup canola oil and 2/3 cup applesauce. Came out great. Probably could have used the whole 8 ounces of cream cheese - a little more frosting would be good. But a very nice recipe overall. Cream cheese frosting is always a hit!
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#These are fabulous ! We love pumpkin, and these were easy and moist!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Love these bars..made for church for a fund raiser and they sold right away!!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I made these exactly as the recipe reads and they were fabulous. My husband and four kids couldn't get enough. Everyone complains about the oil but I have another recipe that takes 3/4 cup of butter so I am not sure why it is a big deal. These taste great and keep well if you happen to have leftovers. My mom has made pumpkin roll for years and honestly I have gotten tired of it so this year I am making these. 
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#Delicious! Most of the time I don't add the frosting which allows me to eat more without the added calories. Also add extra cinnamon and will try the suggestion of using Splenda. 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Absolutely fabulous!!! Moist and delicious, these were amazing!!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#These are wonderful. They are light, airy, moist, and very flavorful. I add about 1/2 tsp of pumpkin spice. I also cheat by using canned whipped white frosting on them (I don't like cream cheese frosting). My 6 year old son loves them. He said, Can I just stick my whole face into the pan? LOL :) 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Anyone who says this is dry or greasy, I'm sorry but you must not have followed the recipe. I have made this several times and it is a huge hit. Delicious and moist. My only change is that I use the whole 8oz. brick of cream cheese in the frosting. Love this, will make this every year. 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#These are really good. I added a shake of cloves in it too.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#My grandson says. tasty, yummy, and very delicious! 
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#Not impressed. Not very moist or flavorful.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I have used this recipe for years and never make pumpkin pie any more. Everyone likes this much better. I use a large can of pumpkin and twice the cinnamon. It makes the bars more moist. They are even better the day after they are made as the flavor is even richer.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Very easy to put together. I greased the cookie sheet and put parchment paper on top of it inside the cookie sheet. It was a little tricky taking it out of the pan but I would do it the same way next time. I had some leftover coconut pecan frosting which I used in place of the cream cheese frosting. Delicious!!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#We added 1 tsp of pumpkin spice. The cake came out very greasy so we wonder about putting 1 full cup into the recipe. We used canned frosting and it definitely improved the flavor. Overall the cake was good but we wouldn't make it again. 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I have been making this exact recipe for years. It is excellent. It irritates me someone would give it a 2 star rating based on buying a cake mix and adding a can of pumpkin to it. Rate the recipe, NOT your version..
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#If you ever need a large amount of bars for a large group this is it. It not only taste good you get a lot of bars.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#This recipe was terrific. Very easy to put together. My husband, daughter & mom are diabetic. I substituted Splenda for the sugar in both the cake and icing and it was delicious. My non-diabetics loved it too. My son-in-law asked me 3 times if I was sure that his wife could eat it. This is definitely going into the family cookbook!
Pumpkin Bars#0#1#I mix 1 spice cake mix with 1 large can pumpkin and 1 egg, get the same results! so quick and easy!! Pour into a buttered 9x13 pan!! Follow baking directions for the cake.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#This recipe was absolutely fabulous!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I used pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon. I'll put in 3 teaspoons next time. Overall easy and tasty. 
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#I used coconut oil instead of canola oil. Super good. Everyone loved them
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#These are simple to make and tasty. A family favorite.
Pumpkin Bars#2#0#Very good. For those of you that want to substitute apple sauce for some of the oil, remember to use only unsweetened applesauce as sweetened applesauce will add more sugar and make the bars too moist.
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#The ingredients are exactly the same as the Pumpkin Rolls I make every year except this seems like a lot less trouble. No jelly roll pan, no rolling into powdered sugared towel, no chance it's going to crack as you roll it up, etc., etc. Definitely gonna give it a try. 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#This recipe looks exactly like the one on foodnetwork.com for Paula Deen's Pumpkin Bars. http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/pumpkin-bars-recipe.html 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#These were super easy to make however and I followed the recipe exactly using the pan size recommended. Mine were ready to come out of the oven at 21 minutes at 350. I am glad I checked the time - my sister makes this recipe often and it is now one of my favorites also! Thank you!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I substituted applesauce for the oil and it turned out way too moist. The toothpick came out clean but the bars actually had a gummy texture. I should try the recipe again as the original recipe reads but honestly I don't like any recipe with that much oil. I also tried chocolate chips sprinkled on top of half of the bars (a jelly roll pan makes a lot of bars so I wanted to try them different way). It was a bad idea. The bars did not have that choc chip pumpkin muffin sense at all. I do agree with many others that the recipe was super easy to put together. At least I have something good to add. 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Easy and super delicious!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I agree with everyone else; this is very moist and delicious! Will definitely be keeping this recipe!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Light and we'll balanced ingredients. I always double the recipe! 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I loved this recipe. It was easy, had everything on hand and turned out great. Will be making them again, for sure!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Excellent! The best pumpkin bars I have ever made. I added about one tablespoon of grated orange rind in the frosting which we liked very much.
Pumpkin Bars#0#1#So good! Could not stop eating them, so bad. Good thing I gave some away. Used the pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon. They were very tasty and moist. I will make again and try the orange icing. Thank you for the recipe.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Made these and they were a hit, have shared recipe with 3 others already. Will make again very soon.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#My family and friends all loved this recipe! I am going to make cupcakes for my kindergarten class at thanksgiving!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Absolutely delicious!!!!! And so easy to make! Will definitely be making again. Great recipe! :-D
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#wonderful flavor and texture ! substitute a teaspoon of maple syrup or the vanilla for a subtle bling !
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Can the 1 Cup oil be substituted with applesauce? I've heard of the substitution in other recipes. 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Can the 1Cup of oil be substituted with applesauce? It seems like a lot of oil.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I have made these bars for over 30 years, and my family and friends love them. For the last 20 or so years, I have been putting orange frosting (1/4 c. melted butter, 2 c. powdered sugar, 2 t. grated orange peel, and enough juice from one orange for spreading consistency). Both are delicious, but we like the orange frosting even better than the cream cheese.
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#I have been making these bars for about 30 years, and my family and friends LOVE them. The only difference in my recipe is that I add 1/2 c. chopped walnuts to the batter, and instead of the cream cheese frosting. I make orange frosting (3 T. melted butter, 2 c. powdered sugar, 2 t. grated orange peel, and enough juice from one orange for spreading consistency) . Both are good; my family just prefers the fresh orange flavor.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I have made this recipe several times. My husband likes it very much as do my children and grandchildren. The icing recipe that I use calls for 8oz cream cheese, 1 stick of butter, 2 cups of confectioners sugar, and 1 tsp of vanilla. I have considered using pumpkin pie spice, but so far have stuck with the cinnamon. Very moist and delicious.
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#Sooooooo delicious and soooo easy! However, I used a full 8 oz. block of cream cheese and a whole stick of butter then adjusted sugar to desired consistency with no need for any milk, just vanilla! Wonderful recipe!!! Definitely a keeper!!!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#and again, and again, and again, etc. etc. It's fabulous!! 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#We love anything made with pumpkin at my house. I made these bars, added a tablespoon of molasses and a teaspoon of vanilla. So good. The kids will have a great treat after school today!!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Taste great, but turned out to be a cake. The only thing I can think thata I did wrong was used too small of a pan.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Sub half applesauce for half the oil...sprinkle chopped walnuts on top of frosting...add pumpkin pie spice...2 teaspoons....excellent recipe....a keeper for sure
Pumpkin Bars#1#1#I made these last night, for the 1st time and my kids wouldn't go to bed without trying them. I took them to the school for a teacher's luncheon and they were gone! I received so many compliments and requests for the recipe. Now my kids want me to make more! This will become one of our regular recipes, it is fabulous! 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#the only difference in your and my recipe is I like to ad a 1/2 tsp on cloves and 1/2 tsp nutmeg for a real holiday flavor, and i throw in a cup of raisins too
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Delicious! Used a whole bar of cream cheese as others suggested, perfect that way! Everyone raved over how moist it was....lots of recipe requests! Will definitely be making again.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I am so happy that I picked this pumpkin recipe to try with my fiance. Very easy to make and I even took other's advice and added nutmeg and allspice. We even had to stop ourselves from eating all of the cream cheese frosting right out of the bowl. This pumpkin treat is the perfect compliment to any Fall Sunday. 
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#This recipe is really delicious but also a favorite because it uses one whole can of canned pumpkin!
Pumpkin Bars#1#0#These are my family's favorite pumpkin bars! They are very easy to make, plus they use an entire can of pumpkin. (I like that because I end up wasting pumpkin when the recipe only calls for part of a can.) The icing is easy to make and not overly sweet. Definitely a keeper! 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Very moist and freezes well. Easy to make. My whole family loves pumpkin, this one will be made frequently.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#These are awesome bars! They were also very easy.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#This was phenomenal!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I made these today and were a hit at work. I added ground nutmeg and used the full 8oz of cream cheese and omitted the water. De-lish!
Pumpkin Bars#0#1#These were especially good. I added 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon and increased the cream cheese to 8 oz. for the frosting. Very easy to make to make. Next time I may sprinkle chopped pecans on the frosting.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#These bars are not only easy but my husband gave me the best review ever, They taste like a fancy dessert from a restaurant . I'll be making these for Thanksgiving, for sure! 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Made these for a Halloween party. Added 2 teaspoons of all spice and 2 teaspoons of nutmeg because I thought it could use more flavor when I tasted the batter. Also did as another poster suggested and used 8 oz. of cream cheese and that was perfect for the icing. Icing was thin so next time I make it, I will leave out the milk completely. Very good base recipe though :-) 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#turned out very moist and the icing was perfect not too much but enough to be able to taste the sweet cream cheese taste. DELISH! I will definitely be making this again!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#My family said, The best pumpkin bars ever! I used a light olive oil instead of vegetable oil and doubled the cream cheese (8 oz) for the frosting. 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#my hole family love this recipe
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I love how easy and delicious the frosting is to make. No store bought!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#My whole family loves them!! Very easy to make and very delicious.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Absolutely delicious and a complete hit when I made them to take to a party! I had to double the icing though.I'd like to find a substitute for the vegetable oil, as one cup seems like an awful lot. 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#This is the best pumpkin bar recipe I've used! I like this recipe because it uses an entire can of pumpkin. A lot of recipes use part of a can and I end up trashing the rest. Also the frosting is super easy to make and overly sweet. It's a perfect compliment to the pumpkin! 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I have made these a few times now and they are very good. The cream cheese frosting is perfect!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I have been making these bars for years...today, when I wanted a pumpkin recipe, this is the first one I thought of. My whole family loves them...and so does everyone else.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Put the batter in a large measuring cup and pour from it. Works really well. 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Very good! Very easy! Will definitely make it again!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#My family REALLY enjoyed this dessert. The cake was so moist and the frosting was delicious! The ONLY change I made was in the cake I deleted the cinnamon and just added 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice. It was ot of this world. GRACIAS for sharing the recipe this will be on the dessert table for THANKSGIVING DAY!!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Served these at a fall party & they were a big hit!~ Theresa
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Excellent recipe. I added pumpkin spice and cloves. They were delicious. Will definately make again.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I brought them to work and everyone loved them. They are easy to make, they come out very moist. They have a mild spice flavor I think next time I will add a little more spice or some pumpkin pie spice as suggested by previous reviewer. Other wise they are greatThanks for the recipe
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Like others had said, I added about a tsp of pumpkin spice to the cake recipe. It turned out very moist and the cream cheese icing was delicious. Not overwhelming and strong like some cream cheese icings can be.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I made a big mistake when I made these, but they turned out all right. I left out the sugar--yikes! But the day was saved when I made the icing! Very good!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#well here i am again,making some more pumpkin bars. this time i made 2 batches, i will need them. they are so good, i also added more spice,we all think they are the best bars we ever had. merry christmas
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#i have made these bars two times already, im making another batch tomorrow.every one loved them.the next batch are mine.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I brought them to work and everyone loved them. They are easy to make, they come out very moist. They have a mild spice flavor I think next time I will add a little more spice or some pumpkin pie spice as suggested by previous reviewer. Other wise they are great
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#These were so moist and delicious! To give them a little more bite , add a little pumpkin pie spice to the recipe. These won't stay in the pan long! 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I made these last night and took to work today. Everyone went crazy about them. They said they were the best and some wanted the recipe.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#Yummy! My whole family loved them and requested I make more & soon.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I use a regular ice cream scoop. Works great!
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I use the spring loaded ice cream scoop for muffins and cupcake liners also. They come in different sizes, and I use the small one to scoop/drop cookie dough. The larger one, besides for cupcakes, is great if you want to make monster size cookies (about 4 inches across) 
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I read somewhere that you can use a turkey baster to fill cup cake liners. No spilling.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I use a small ladle to fill muffin cups.
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#I use a creamer pitcher to just pour the batter ito the cupcake liners
Pumpkin Bars#0#0#For Halloween, tint icing light green and put in decorator bag. Pipe onto bars in a wiggly line to make'snake' bars. Use black food gel to dot eyes. 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#5#0#OMG! This hearty soup is the bomb. It is easy to cut the recipe in half for a smaller quantity. Creamy, mushroomy, with a hint of heat. My husband added hot sauce for that extra umph! Love, love, love this soup!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#3#0#This was excellent! Makes a large batch so I froze half of it to enjoy later. Did not change a thing - delicious as written!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#8#3#This soup is good, but my family prefers a different Cheeseburger soup recipe that I've adapted from Taste of Home. For us this just lacked something, but we liked the mushrooms. I will probably add mushrooms to the my Cheeseburger soup. 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#4#4#Very good soup! I did half of the recipe for my husband and I and it was the perfect amount for us to eat once with leftovers a couple of times.I left out the jalapeno peppers since we do not like spicy food. I also kept it in the crock pot for a couple of hours on warm since I needed to make the meal a while before we would be able to eat. Turned out great!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#3#0#Great cheeseburger soup! Easy to follow directions and great for a cold day.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#2#12#Why does everything have to have a spicy kick? There are tons of people who cannot tolerate this. The same goes for the t.v. food channels.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#This soup is so good!! We fix it for those cold days !! We love it!!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Everyone loved it, will make it again.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#I doubled ALL the veggies, used half and half instead of milk and added one cup of sharp cheddar. Mmmm Mmmm Good!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#1#0#We have been making this for over a year, it is amazing ! Leftovers are easily frozen.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Delicious. Thick and chunky. My husband loved it.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Good soup, needs zip
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#1#0#My husband and I really liked this soup. I added a few red pepper flakes to give it a little zing and was good. Might try and add some ground sausage to it next time.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Yum!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Can you freeze this?
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#4#1#Winter comfort in a bowl!Loved this soup - better than a previous recipe I'd tried, too. I didn't add the mushrooms, green pepper, or jalapenos, and did a bit less milk. At the end it seemed to need some herbs so I added a bit of dill and parsley - and then it was perfect! 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#1#3#Oh my yummy! This soup is a winner. I did make a few changes. I forgot to buy carrots, so I didn't add that; only added about half the mushrooms (not a huge mushroom fan, and I would chop them really small next time), and used 3 generous cups of sharp cheddar instead of Velveeta (personal preference). The leftovers are just as amazing. I will definitely be making this again, probably with bread bowls next time. Mmmmm! 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#2#Very good recipe! I made a couple modifications thoughI didn't add any mushrooms,I didn't use any butter since the beef had enough fat,I used a stick blender on the soup before I added the ground beef,I didn't use any flour to thicken the soup as the potatoes thickened it enough.And finally, I added a little pickle juice to the soup.That really added something that was missing. 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#1#0#Very good! There were no leftovers!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Everyone raved about this soup at Deer Camp - men AND women! Very satisfying!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#1#0#This was a good recipe because my family liked it. I guess I didnt care for it too much because it was so thick! It almost has too much cheese in it (is there such a thing?) So I would suggest maybe making it with extra beef broth, or bouillon cubes and water and topping it with cheese. For my personal tastes anyway...
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#1#I have made this recipe for years now. I got this recipe from the original magazine it came out in 2010. My whole family loves it. Even our daughter since she was old enough to eat it has ate every bite. We do leave the mushrooms out since I am not a big fan. It's the first thing we make once it gets cold! 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#excellent! My family loved it. I didn't put mushrooms in it though 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Having company for a week. Any chance this one freezes well?
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#1#I had to use Cheesewhiz and it seems to work well. My family enjoyed it.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#I tried this and it is amazing. I am pregnant and I know the baby loves it already.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#We have made this soup 4 or 5 times now and it is soooo good! We usually omit the jalapenos because of the grandkids, but definitely a keeper.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Very bland
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#1#0#To 762jasmin Just do it like she says and instead of Dutch oven use crock pot. Add milk, flour and cheese about 30 mins to an hour before done. :)
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#DELICIOUS, my wife even enjoyed it! She doesn't like Jalapenos, she a Yankee! 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Anyone know how to make this a slow cooker recipe?
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#4#0#For loisk . . . you can make it or not , eat it or not, that's your own business and we don't get to know, but . . . . being rude is something we all get to see. Soup is good! 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#I need a lesser quanity,therefore I'll need to divide the recipe, 3stars.I think I want to try a nippy cheese instead of a Velveeta. 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#3#0#Again..I repeat again..Taste of Home site has the rudest reviewers.. i ignore them as they never prepare the recipe or attempt to make substitutions. When I see their name I skip them.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#This soup was very easy to make and was a big hit. Something we call a keeper ! 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#2#0#Hi Lois, Thought this site was for reviews, not criticism, BTW, soup was Amazingly good! Thanks TOH for the recipe
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#5#This soup is so unhealthy it should have a warning label. Here's to obesity. 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Everyone in my family LOVES this soup! I did not have beef bouillon so I substituted it with an envelope of beefy onion soup mix and cooked it with my ground beef. A definate winner!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#I am gluten free and i use a all purpose G/F flour or just rice flour. 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#1#0#Love this soup on a cold day!! For more flavor ---cook your bacon about a 1/2 pound set aside, save some of the dripping to cook the beef & mushrooms in (season with your favorite taco seasoning) (i add the mushrooms when the beef is almost done) when the beef and mushrooms are done crumble and add the bacon. Always a favorite in the fall and winter.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#1#Really tasty. I did season the ground beef while cooking and skipped the mushrooms... and I drained the meat. Used 3/4 regular velvetta and 1/4 mexican velvetta (because I had it in the fridge). Will definately make it again.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#1#0#Tastes like eating melted plastic thanks to the Velveeta. Next time I would use real cheddar and it might edible then.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Great meal on a cool Fall day.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#1#I made this soup once--more than a year ago. It was a huge hit with everyone. I'd very much like to convert it to a RIVAL crock pot recipe as I had a bit of a sticking problem after adding VELVEETA. I'd like to try it in the crock, bit I don't want to ruin it. Liked review replacing peppers with hot sauce since I don't like chopping the jalapenos, Any suggestions/thoughts would be greatly appreciated!!!! 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Something the whole family will love.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#1#0#Made this EXACTLY like the recipe and it is one of my very favorites !!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this soup !!!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#1#This is absolutely a FAVORITE in my house. Something guest request... I don't do the mushrooms- cause of family preference- Trust me it's just the BEST. 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#1#0#Ate this by the truck load :)
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#I made this soup and my husband loved it. I gave my best friend a bowl to try and when her husband tasted it, he made her make a pot of it the next day. This is very yummy and very filling.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#My whole family was very disappointed with this soup. We were expecting something amazing and it was just mediocre to us.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#I made this soup today. I chaged it a bit. Had leftover porkroast and gravy,so used it instead of hamburger and boullion. Used hashbrown potatoes, put half in at beginning and saved rest t heat thru at end so they held their shape, the early ones helped thicken the soup, added some frozen corn and made it like chowder, which my hubby loves. Use 1% milk. 2% mex. blend cheese. required no flour. i used no velveeta. It's bad for u, did use a bit of Hormel real bacon bits on top. It s so good. Oh and I halfed the recipe, just two of us. still enuf for two meals. 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#1#This receipe is bullet proof because I really messed it up. I used ground turkey and chicken bullion but it wasn't that. here is what I did: browned the turkey and onions, threw in the potatoes and carrots with the water and buillion and simmer about 15 minutes. While that was nhappening I made a roux out of butter (I used 4 T instead of the 2) and flour, milk, melted in the cheese. By the time the vegs were soft the cheese mixture was ready and I just threw it in the pot. Soup done. Tasted great and no worry with lumps. Really good with ground turkey by the way. 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#This soup will provide a party for your tastebuds while it fills the tummy up!!! This has been our absolute favorite soup ever since the first time that I stumbled across the recipe in a Taste of Home magazine. I even won a fund raising soup contest at work with it. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#1#0#This recipe is so good! i have made it a few times and everytime my whole family loves it.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#1#0#Even the hard-to-pleasers love it!!!! One of my favorites 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#I made this soup and used ground chicken instead of beef and it was fantastic. I used chicken bouillon instead of beef and then made just like the receipt called for. You got to try it. YUMMY
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#1#0#My family just loves this soup. Yummmm!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Very yummy!!!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Very hearty and filling. Great winter soup. Made according to the recipe. Had great flavor.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#no flavor at all
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Soo Good!! Will make it again and again.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#delicious!!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#I think this soup would be good make with chicken or even sausage. I love the thickness of it. It is so creamy and rich with flavor
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#1#0#I just finished making this soup and I believe it has potential. I did follow the recipe, however for my personal preference this soup needs more flavor. The beef flavor, and Velveeta are not enough to increase the saltiness Perhaps just simply seasoning the ground beef while cooking will be enough. I am going to make this again and experiment.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Made this for lunch with a long-time friend & she is still talking about it. I omitted the mushrooms and used Tabasco in place of the jalapenos. Definitely a keeper.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#1#0#Made exactly as recipe suggested, and this soup was AMAZING!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#VERY EASY TO MAKE AND SOOOOO GOOD!! CRUSTY BREAD AND IT IS A WHOLE MEAL
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#1#0#Served this to company on a cold, wet night. Everyone loved it!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#This soup is WONDERFUL. I made it for several parties and everyone wanted the recipe. It makes quite a bit.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#1#Family really enjoyed this! Substituted a 32 oz. bag of hashbrowns for potatoes and sauteed onions, green pepper, and carrots with the meat. Left out the mushrooms since I forgot to buy them. Also substituted a small can of chopped green chilies for the jalapeño. We will make again.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Perfect for a cold winter day!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#delicious!!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#1#Wonderful, hearty soup! I used shredded sharp cheddar instead of Velveeta - tasted even better this way! Also substituted 1 Tbsp of bacon bits per slice of bacon.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#This is so delicious, and is now a family favorite..I did cust the recipe in half as 14 servings is a lot...
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Super good and very easy to make
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Even better the second day!!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#1#Even better than I expected. Not heavy. I made it exactly as written with the exception of mushrooms (don't like'em). I'm glad I made the whole recipe so we will get several meals throughout the fall. Thanks, Taste of Home. I don't give many recipes 5 stars. 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Everyone loves this soup and it has so many good things in it. I did change it up and used Velveeta Mexican instead of the regular Velveeta for tonight so we'll how it goes over. I agree - a totally hearty meal great for a fall or winter night! I make it every fall/winter around here and it makes enough for a two meals for my family of 5. 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#I've made this soup for several years. Both my husband and I love it. It is a very filling and satisfying soup - right up at the top of the listing comfort Food . 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#I love this soup and I am not a soup person. Only thing is I cut it in half since 14 servings is just too much for my family.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Very tasty and filling. I found it to be a very flexible recipe with modifications made to suit my family. We all loved it and will enjoy it next time as it is on the must do again list!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#1#This is an excellent soup that the entire family enjoyed! I did add 1 can of chopped green chilies instead of the jalapeno pepper and omitted the mushrooms just because I didn't have them on hand....Making this again and again! 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#This is one awesome soup !!!!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#My whole family loves this and it couldn't be easier. Definitely a keeper! 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#This is my church's favorite recipe. If I don't show up with this soup at our potluck I would get lynched...seriously, this is the best soup we have ever had. 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#1#Absolutely yummy! Made it twice over the weekend. I omitted the carrots, mushrooms, & crumbled bacon to suit my husband's taste and just used shredded cheddar cheese instead of process cheese and it was excellent. I also used cornstarch instead of flour to thicken it up to save on some carbs. Super quick and easy as well. My husband absolutely loved it as did my son. Definitely is going into the keeper file. 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Really good soup. Instead of using the velveeta cheese. I just substitued a basic cheese sauce from scratch. Everyone loves this soup!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Great soup for a cold day. My family loved it.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#1#Haven't made this recipe yet but want to try it. KJ1, if you can't have much dairy try your health food store for soy cheeses and ask your grocer to carry soy milk. 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#very easy and YUMMY!!! this is a keeper.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0##1 Hit at my house. j allen 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#This soup is so good. My favorite!
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#what can I use instead of the jalapeno? a can of green chiliespdj
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#This is the same recipe as Spicy Cheeseburger Soup (a recipe from a couple of years ago)except for the mushrooms. This is our favorite soup.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#If replacing flour with cornstarch, it only takes 1/2 the amount for cornstarch. This recipe calls for 2T. of flour so use 1 T. of cornstarch.
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Re Cheeseburger Paradise SoupWhenever I make a creamed soup I thicken it with instant mashed potatoes instead of flour. Works great!oldguy347
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#My husband & eldest son are gluten intolerant as well so I'm always improvising on recipes to make them acceptable for their dietary needs. Yes, you can use cornstarch instead of the flour.  The consistency will be a tad different but it will taste just as good! One of my favorite gluten free substitutes for wheat flour in recipes is Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Flour.  It contains a blend of five different gluten free flours that makes an EXCELLENT substitute in all your recipes.  *Note:  you would use the cornstarch or the GF AP Flour in equal measures to replace the wheat flour. 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#I have celiac disease and cannot consume gluten. Can I substitute corn starth o tapioca for the flour? If so, what amount? Thank you
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#I have to agree with you, Mel7445. This soup is totally awesome. I've made it several times, but just recently found out that I shouldn't have much dairy:(. I really want to make it, but just not sure what to do. 
Cheeseburger Paradise Soup#0#0#Wow, this soup is fabulous! It freezes really well and tastes just as good reheated! To make it a little healthier, I used skim milk, 2% Velveeta and Turkey bacon. I will be making this again!
Special Banana Nut Bread#2#1#I followed the recipe exactly. It came out great. a couple of comments may be helpful. First, my batter was way more than required for 2 4x8 pans. I used 3 pans. Second, even with 3 pans a whole cup of nuts on top was too much. I should have put 1 1/2 cups of nuts in the batter and a 1/2 cup for sprinkling on top. I did 2 with glaze and 1 without. I definitely liked the glaze. Letting the bread completely cool is important to allow it to set. It is too crumbly when you try to cut it while still warm.
Special Banana Nut Bread#4#2#With the high amount of sugar required the bread would be like store bought. Bananas are quite sweet on their own. I used 1/2 c brown sugar and the bread was amazing.
Special Banana Nut Bread#4#0#This banana bread is outstanding! I use walnuts instead of pecans and I mix them in completely instead of saving half for the top. The orange glase is just right to set off the banana flavor. Thank you for this recipe. I've made it several times and have it saved several places electronically plus in hard copy.
Special Banana Nut Bread#2#0#Never made Banana nut bread with a glaze. My husband like it better, so I'll be making this one again. Thanks for sharing the recipe. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I've been making this recipe for 8 plus years! It's great and always turns out great.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Best banana nut bread ever!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I just left a very positive comment on the bread and wanted to add this note. Check the bread after about 30 minutes to see if it's getting too brown. I checked it after 45 minutes and that was just a bit too long. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is a very good banana bread, I did not change anything, except did not use any frosting or sauce. Loved it
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#The banana bread was good. Three of us finished the two loaves in 4 days. I will try the recipe on this site that uses pineapple and compare.
Special Banana Nut Bread#1#0#I substituted 1 cup of light brown sugar for 1 cup of white sugar. I also toasted the pecans before chopping and adding to the batter. I did not use the glaze. This is a very moist and dense cake. Very very happy with this recipe.
Special Banana Nut Bread#1#0#This banana bread is easily the best I've ever had. The glaze adds sweetness and texture. I think this will become my go-to recipe. VFE
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I've made this bread numerous times now and it IS THE BEST Banana Bread I've EVA EATEN!!! I haven't even made w/sauce yet, and it's STILL THE BEST.
Special Banana Nut Bread#1#0#Just finished making this for the first time and it is perfect. By far the best banana bread I've eaten, and the glaze makes it all that much better. Definitely replacing my old banana bread recipe with this one!
Special Banana Nut Bread#1#0#I have been using this recipe for many years, exactly as written and it has always come out perfect. Most people who taste it tell me that I make the best banana bread they have ever had.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Boy, I made this and it was an epic fail. Not sure what went wrong. With all the 5 star rating, I must have really done something wrong although I can not figure out what it was. The pecans on top definitely burnt as was warned. But also the sides and bottom really burnt yet there was a thick layer near the bottom that was soggy and unbaked. I must get a oven thermometer to check my temperatures. What was edible was yummy.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This was phenomenal!
Special Banana Nut Bread#1#0#Excellent recipe!! I add 1 tsp banana extract and reduce the sugar to 1 cup. To release the bread from the pans, I place wax paper to fit the bottom. Grease the wax paper and sprinkle cinnamon/sugar on the paper. Don't grease the sides so that the batter can rise to its maximum. While the pans are still warm, not hot, run a knife along the sides, turn out the loaves on a cooling rack. I do not use the glaze. I use two 9 x 5 pans and bake all my dessert breads at 325 degrees. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#1#0#I followed the recipe exactly, and it's delicious, with pleasing texture and flavor. I have a favorite banana bread recipe that I have used for years, but I like this one because it is less sweet. I am partial to orange flavor, so the orange glaze really put this bread over the top. Beverly, I live in Ellicott City so we're practically neighbors! Thank you for an excellent recipe.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is an excellent banana bread. Easy to assemble and delicious. Will definitely be making this again. I had about a half of cup of chocolate chips that I threw in as well. the hint of chocolate with the orange sauce was awesome.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#The best banana nut bread ever! The only change that I made was the nuts. I put the whole cup in the batter but didn't put any on the top until I glazed the loaves and then I only sprinkled a few. Utterly delicious****** 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Been using this recipe for over five years. Best ever! Started out following recipe then changed!! Have put in chocolate chips ,left out nuts, when did use nuts it was mostly pecans, and just lightly put sugar on bottom and sides. Not too many changes because it is great as is. I just made another copy of recipe.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Made for teachers along with several other banana bread recipes and this was the first thing gone. Very delicious!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Very moist and delicious. Will definitely make again, but would pierce the crust prior to putting on the glaze so it get down into the bread.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is very good. I left off the glaze, used walnuts instead of pecans and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 c. Very moist and more dense which we liked. Will definitely be a regular treat!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is delicious. It is the best banana bread recipe I have found.The orange glaze on top makes it really special.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Loved this with the touch of orange, made it different than the basic banana nut breads. I also read the recipe wrong and put all of the pecans into the batter and had to add more to the top. Not a problem for me!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I've made Banana bread for years, and this is the best I've ever tasted. My friends LOVED it also. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#She was probably baking and texting and missed a task!!
Special Banana Nut Bread#1#0#I didn't think this recipe was great or outstanding. It wasn't real moist. Maybe I needed to put another banana. Just okay. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I don't know what that woman did but I have been making this for years,. So Yummy! and it is gone in about 6 hours, thank goodness it makes a second loaf. Freezes great too! My husband and 2 teenage boys beg me to make this one a regular basis, if they would stop eating the bananas! I do not use the glaze. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#OUTSTANDING!! ***** I made the Special Banana Nut Bread and didn't change or modify anything about it. The recipe made two full loaves. We ate one; gave the other away. It was moist, flavorful, and didn't disappoint. My sister-in-law (the recipient of the giveaway) has many banana bread recipes but a few days later she said it was the best banana bread she's ever eaten and said she's throwing out all her other recipes. The orange juice glaze gave it a great punch. Thank you for this recipe! This one's a keeper!! ***** 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I was really disappointed. After reading many of the reviews I decided to make this recipe. It is the worst banana nut bread recipe I've made. I really have no idea how it was a contest winning recipe. :( 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Never turning back! Best. Banana. Bread. Ever.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is an excellent recipe. The only modifications that I made were: I used 1 cup of sugar (instead of 2 cups), I used five very ripe bananas (instead of about 4), I used 1 cup of walnuts (instead of 2 cups of pecans). I also waited a good 10-15 minutes for the loaves to cool down before putting the glaze over them, as some reviewers have mentioned it made a huge difference. I am planning on bringing one loaf to work on Monday. Let's spread the joy! :-) Delicious! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I have made this recipe quite a few times and every time I make it, my girls curse me a plenty, all the while gobble gobble chunk by chunk! It is a fabulous recipe. I usually bake it in four small bread pans rather than the two larger ones.My only change to this recipe is to pan roast the pecans up front.*FULL DISCLOSURE*I usually eat one of the small loaves by myself before it has time to cool! Then I take my insulin...
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#delicious! it is moist, i love the orange glaze and the best is it makes 2 loaves!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Very tasty!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I'm so glad I tried this bread. Absolutely delicious! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Got this going in the oven now. I have made this in the past and it doesn't last long around here, I use a bundt pan to cook it in and comes out great 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#My husband has been begging me to make banana bread. I found this one and I'm glad I did. I used 6 mini loaf pans and baked them for 35 minutes at 350. I made two without nuts for my 14 year old, two topped with pecans for my husband, and two topped with walnuts for myself. I didn't make the glaze because I didn't have any oranges. Thanks for the great recipe! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is THE BEST banana nut bread recipe! I have tried many in the past I will never use another one. It is delicious, doesn't crumble all over the place, the bananas cook evenly, and with or without the glaze (for those who don't care for things too sweet) it is just heavenly. Thank you Beverly Sprague for sharing your very fabulous recipe. I am getting ready to make another batch right now! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Really liked this recipe.... made it exactly as Beverly wrote it!! YUM!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#great flavor...cakelike texture...not moist and dense
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#People request this from me all of the time! A great recipe.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is an amazing recipe. Don't know what I liked more, the cream cheese or the Orange glaze. Yum! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Amazing banana bread. Although I do replace half the white sugar with brown sugar and I omit the nuts and orange glaze.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Just an OK recipe to me. A rather heavy bread, not light like most of my quick bread recipes are. Also, way too many nuts for my taste. Will return to my go to banana nut recipe 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I just love this recipe. I don't ever make the glaze. It's so yummy, who needs it? My one change is that I use glazed pecans, like pecan pie glazed or honey glazed, that I chop rather than plain pecans. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Took one loaf to work and it disappeared immediately and lots of compliments. This is definitely a keeper. The orange glaze really gives it something extra. This will be my banana bread recipe from now on!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I made large and small muffins and how moist and flavorful they are, amazing. I cut back the sugar to one cup rather then two. Would have been way too sweet for me. Next time I am going to try 3/4 cup of sugar. It's just a matter of tasting the batter and if it needs more add it. I always under estimate the sugar and it usually works for me. If your having a party try the mini cup or the regular cup cake pans these will be the hit of the party. You can't go wrong with the recipe. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This bread is wonderful. I wanted to try it out so I only made 1/2 recipe. Just a note, the full recipe calls for 2 cups of sugar. I halved the recipe and used about 1/2 cup of sugar. It is plenty sweet. Next time I will make two loaves. Thanks for the great recipe.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is Great and requested lots by family members. I do not make the glaze when I make it, the bread does not need it! This bread is so moist! Only recipe I use!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#5 stars This IS the best banana bread! So moist and I have made it multiple times!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I love this recipe. It is so moist and delicious. I've made several banana nut bread recipes over the years and this one is the very best. Thank you taste of home. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I love this recipe. It is so moist and delicious. I've made several banana nut bread recipes over the years and this one is the very best. Thank you taste of home. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I made this Banana Bread about a week ago as something to nice to give my neighbor and I kept one loaf for my family. All who tried it loved it, the bread didn't make it in my home past breakfast and my neighbor asked for the recipe. I have tried many recipes for banana bread and this is by far my favorite. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This was one of the best Banana Nut Bread recipes I've baked. I used walnuts instead of pecans because that's what i had on hand. I also didn't do the glaze. It's so good you don't need it and I'd hate to cover up the yummy, moist taste. This is my new go to Banana Nut Bread recipe! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Found this recipe today and made it. It is very delicious and will be my banana nut bread recipe from now on.... Thank you!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I made this for a potluck at work.. and out of all the things that I've made, this was the one that most people wanted the recipe to make themselves. In fact, one of my coworkers made it for her team's very next potluck! I'm making a batch right now so I can freeze it and give out for Christmas gifts. :) 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#The best I've ever eaten. It replaces my recipe from 45 years ago. The orange juice and zest make this banana bread. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I've made this recipe twice now & it's one of my new favorites. It tastes best after it's sat for a day. I don't make the glaze. I do, however, add a cup of mini chocolate chips to the batter. I use walnuts instead of pecans. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Amazing banana bread! The cream cheese adds richness but it is not a heavy bread at all. It doesnt have such a strong banana flavour as other breads. I didn't do the nut topping or the glaze and we just gobbled it up for breakfast this morning :) 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I LOVED this recipe! I thank you for posting it to Taste of Home!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I have made this recipe & it's GREAT! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This has to be the BEST banana nut bread ever.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is the best banana bread that I've ever had, and I have tried many different varieties. Definitely a keeper! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#this receipe is is terrible, very heavy texture, and very sweet. would not recommend this to any one, it`s was a big waste to make. it make out heavier than a brick!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Amazing!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I have made this bread several times and it always turns out great. Everyone that has tasted it has wanted the recipe. The only thing I change is I wait ten minutes before I put on the glaze. Otherwise the top of the bread turns soggy.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#With the addition of cream cheese to the batter this makes this bread extra moist, extra tasty and extra special!! Took it to work and had to give the recipe!!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Wonderful recipe! We enjoy it very much. Does not last long. It makes 2 loaves & freezes well. It is light, some banana breads I think are to heavy. DELICIOUS!!! I have made the recipe several times. One of our favorites.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This was very moist and it was easy to make with ingredients I had on hand. Making two loaves was another plus!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Absolutely the best! Love that it makes 2 loaves. I always keep one for my family and give one away. Haven't found anyone that doesn't love this! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#OMG!!! My sister made this recipe during the Thanksgiving holiday and it was the best banana bread I've ever eaten, and believe me, I've eaten a lot. I have already made it and shared with my neighbor--but now wish I'd kept it for us. Yum,Yum, Yum!Verne...... 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Works fine with whole wheat flour. If you're crazy about pecans, use the 2 cups, or you could get by fine with 1 and not sprinkle them on top.~ Theresa 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Very, very good!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is my favorite banana bread recipe. The cream cheese in the batter really gives it a good flavor, and the toasted pecans with the orange glaze on top makes it taste SO good! I love this bread.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#loved this!!!! I only had a 1/2 pkg of cream cheese, so I made up the rest with banana yogurt. I also added marchino cherries and dried apricots. I like lots of fruit... Nice and moist
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I have made this and it is better then the one I have been using for years!!! Extremely moist. I didn't use the orange glaze but instead used a nut blend. Yummy!!! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Baked this for the first time today. Rather than loaves, I baked it as cup cakes made 27 regular size. Although the batter is stiffer than a normal cake mix, I simply spooned it into paper liners. Baked them for 25 minutes in a 325 degree oven (but I also kept a close eye on them & tested then with a toothpick @ 20 minutes.) I plan to ice them with a bit of caramel cream cheese icing since they are for a party . . . but they are great just out of the oven! My taste-tester (hubby) says this is a definite keeper!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I used 1 cup of chocolate chips & shaved cocnut instead of nuts. and it is super good!!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This was delicious banana bread! I will replace my tried and true banana bread recipe of 32 years with this! YUM! YUM! YUM! (I used reduced fat cream cheese because I had it on hand).
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is my favorite
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This recipe is amazing beyond speech! I made two batches, one with just-ripened bananas and one with overripe bananas. The one with the overripe bananas came out tasting better, so this is how I will make it in the future. The best thing about this bread? The next day! The taste of this at day old is spectacular! Like eating banana bread and bread pudding in one. Make this y'all! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#It's just amazing...make it!!! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This was a great recipe. It made 2 large loaves that my friends said were the best they had ever had!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This was amazing! I made it to send to my husband who is currently deployed. As soon as he gets it I will post about how it did with going through the mail. I was shocked that there wasn't any cinnamon but it doesn't really need it. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#We make this banana bread all the time. It is by far our favorite. We use less pecans though because I don't care for them (maybe 1/4 cup total?) and we haven't actually tried it with the glaze yet. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I made this for my family the other day and they are still raving about it, so today i made two more loaves and they turned out even better than the first two I made...my daughter who doesn't like banana bread loved it too and has ask me for the recipe...this will always be my go to for banana bread! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Oh my goodness....melt in your mouth, can't get enough, would give my right arm for! I will never use another banana bread recipe. Thank you for sharing this recipe! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Great Banana Nut Bread Recipe. I have been baking this since I read the recipe in my October/November 2007 issue to Taste of Home. I always make it for Thanksgiving morning. It's the best! Thank you for the recipe. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I made this for a little bake-off with girls from work....it's the Best banana bread I've ever made...and I bake A LOT! Just MAKE THIS one....you'll never look for a banana bread recipe again! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#We used walnuts instead of pecans. A little more traditional but still absoutly fantastic! Both loaves were gone with 2 days!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I made it for the first time yesterday and it impressed my husband. He said this is probably the best banana nut bread he's ever had. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Wonderful bread...it replaced my all time favorite recipe. I'll never try another! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Thanks,the recipe sure sounds great. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Excellent taste. It has become a family favorite. We don't like nuts and it tastes wonderful without them. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Wow - who'd have ever thought banana bread could be this good. It deserves the blue ribbon. The orange glaze flavor puts it over the top for me. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#very moist,very good,i will be making again my family loved it!!!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#OH yes, my friend Marina Castle told me about this one, i made a double batch. Awesome! I did add grated fresh nutmeg and cinnamon, and substituted brown sugar for part of the white. PERFECT! I am giving some out to the neighbors :)
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I thought this recipe was the best banana nut bread I have ever had. I hosted Mothers Day (2010) and everyone loved it. Thank you very much.Gloria Pecz
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Excellent!!!!! Made one with the glaze and one with out, both were good!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is a great recipe...it's easy and very tasty. My whole family loves it. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is my favorite banana bread recipe. The cream cheese adds such a delicious flavor and richness to the bread. And I dearly love the pecans and orange glaze on top. It's very delicious bread. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#My nieces love this recipe. I have made it several times, with and without pecans and it's divine! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Best Banana Bread I've ever had! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I might try this again. It tastes very good but did not come out of the pan after the 10 minute wait. The top broke off and the rest was stuck. They were 8 x 4 non-stick pans that I greased - never had this happen before and I make many different banana breads. Any suggestions would be appreciated - it is a VERY good tasting bread. Should it have been 3 pans? The batter filled up 2 pans. Thanks
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I LOVE this banana bread recipe! The best thing is that it makes 2 loaves! I make breads for our coffee break on Sunday and this recipe is among them! I've received compliments on this bread! Dawn E. Lowenstein 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This gets rave reviews from my co-workers. The pecans on top & the cream cheese really make this!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Okay, here's the thing...I made this and ate a piece right after it had cooled and I thought what are these people talking about, that this is the best banana bread ever? BUT, then I stored it in my fridge and tried a piece the next day and wow, I was hooked and so was my nephew who comes to my house before school (he probably finished off a loaf by himself!) I do not eat nuts so I left them out and it was so amazing! Thank you SO much for submitting this recipe! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Hands down, best. banana. bread. ever. Throwing away all the others that I've used in the past. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#The best one. Love all the nuts and the orange glaze. I added an extra 1/2 c. banana. Just fantastic.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Everyone who tries this banana bread absolutely LOVES it. It is the most flavorful, incredible dessert. I won't make any other kind. One taste of this and you will be hooked! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This recipe rocks!! It comes out so moist and delicious and packs a one of a kind flavor!! I have made this many times and will not modify!!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is my favorite banana bread recipe. It turned out really great, I made 12 muffins and one loaf of bread. It was perfect the muffins were better than the bread because of the cooking time I think. I did add cinnamon sugar mix to the batter and sprinkled it on top with the pecans, I reduced the pecans by 1/2 cup though. And it was fabulous!!! For the glaze I just added milk instead of the orange juice to the glaze.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is the best banana nut bread I have ever made. I had rave reviews from work and all wanted the recipe, which I printed for them. I only used three bananas and wow!! Thank you Taste of Home!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is wonderful! On the cooling racks now, and we can't wait! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is the best banana bread that I have ever made. It gets lots of compliments wherever I take it!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I have tried many Banana Bread receipes, but this is the best tasting one yet. Delicious!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I couldn't wait for these loaves to come out of the oven to taste after all the reviews, and I wasn't dissappointed one bit. The texture and taste is wonderful. It will take first place in Banana Bread recipe in my household for sure. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I only wish that it wasn't so full of fat and calories--is there any way you can do a recipe make-over on this one? I LOVE it but can't enjoy as often as I'd like due to the high calorie/fat content. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I looked for a good banana bread recipe for years!! My search is complete now that I've found this recipe!! It is so delicious. I've never tasted banana bread so good before! And I'm the one making it! :) Thanks Taste of Home! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is the most AMAZING banana bread that I've ever made! It's getting close to the holidays and I'm already getting requests to make it. The orange glaze is a great compliment. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#Made this recipe this past weekend and cannot believe how delicious it is. In the 13 years I've been married, my husband has never eaten banana bread. However, when I had him try this, he was shocked at how good it was. Everytime I turn around, he's getting another slice. The kids absolutely love it and I swear it's the best thing I've made in years. Throwing away the other banana bread recipes because none of them compare. We leave out the nuts, but it doesn't take away from the end result. The texture and the glaze truly make this banana bread unforgettable. 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#AWESOME!!!! Don't even bother trying to find a banana bread recipe better than this one! Won't happen. This is even better than mom's! (Don't tell her THAT though!) 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This recipe is a sure winner! I've used it over and over again. Always turns out moist and delicious! My family loves it. I always have to bake a loaf for my brother's family to take back home with them.(I use walnuts instead of pecans.) I finally found the perfect banana nut bread recipe. yeah! 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I made this for our church Mothers Day Dinner. I did it in 4 small pans and 9 muffin tops. The all turned out fantastic. Very moist and didn't dry out even 2 days later. Will make it again for our bake sale... 
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#THIS IS THE BEST BANANA BREAD I HAVE EVER HAD. I WILL BE ADDING IT TO MY FAVIORTS. THANK-YOU JILL FROM FLORIDA
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is one of the best banana breads ever. The one loaf was eaten in a day and I froze the other which we had for Thanksgiving morning and it received rave reviews from guests. Thanks for the great recipe!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#MY FAMILY AND I LOVE THIS BANANA BREAD. THE ONLY THING WE DO IS PUTTING LESS GLAZE.IF YOU LIKE SWEETNESS THAN ADD ON THE GLAZE.AWSOME!!!!
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is the best banana bread i have ever tasted my husband wants me to bake it all the time and so do my friends and family. I take it to gatherings and give it away as gifts. we moved and i lost the recipe THANK GOODNESS for Taste of Home being on line...cutie50
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#This is the only banana bread I make. I lost the recipe and my husband panicked... he is addicted to this bread!! This is the best bread I have ever made. Delicious.
Special Banana Nut Bread#0#0#I just pulled this out of the oven and haven't tasted it yet. Used the correct sized pans but the loaves wouldn't bake--it took about an hour and a half and then the tops burned--they looked too full as I was filling the pans up. Should I have used 3 pans? 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#1#0#This recipe is amazing! Perfect peanut butter cup flavors! A must try!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#5#2#When I started making this, I was sure I was going to hate it. ( I didnt even save the recipe. ) To my surprise it was wonderful. Not too overwhelming taste of peanut butter . It was perfect taste of chocolate and peanut butter, still tasting the cheesecake. I used a package of chocolate Graham crackers instead of oreos. And I drizzled the chocolate fudge topping to make it look like lattice instead of covering it. no peanut butter cups were needed. It was awesome. Everyone loved it . Definitely 5? took 2 days to find the recipe again but now its saved in 2 places !!!!!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This recipe turned out perfectly. I followed the recipe with one exception, I didn't have a 9 pan so I used a 9.5 pan. I have a gas convection oven and cooked at the lowest cooking time and it turned out perfectly. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#3#0#This is an awesome recipe. The only change I make is to add peanut butter cups to the batter before baking. I still include them on top as well. Delicious! Thanks for sharing this easy and tasty recipe!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This recipe has been a family favorite for more than 10 years, after first seeing it in Taste of Home magazine. Our copy is getting a bit frayed, glad to see the recipe is available online. Delicious!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#1#0#Made this for wife's church bake sale several years ago, and they've begged for another every subsequent year. It has always cracked in the past, so this year I baked at 325°F for 55 minutes with a pan of water in the oven, then turned off the oven and left it in oven with door cracked for 15 more minutes. No cracks in cake! Also helpful to know: 1.25 c Graham Cramer crumbs is 11 crackers; 0.25 c Oreo crumbs is 3 Oreo cookies. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Made this for my coworkers and it was a humongous hit! Didn't change a thing and will definitely be making it often!!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I made this for my daughter's 30th birthday and it was a smash hit! Other than using an all-oreo crust I made this as written. It was easy and so, so good. Will definitely keep in my recipe box and make again! 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This is an excellent cheesecake. I made it as written for Thanksgiving, then omitted the peanut butter and candy cups and use this as my basic cheesecake recipe. Comes out beautiful everytime. Only difference is I use a waterbath when I bake it.
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#1#0#Dawn thank you for posting this outrageously delicious sounding cheesecake recipe. I will be making this for the holidays for sure. Funny this California girl (me) knows where Hatboro is. I made a galant attempt to get there so I could go to DaddyPops Diner&did several things!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I actually made this in August for my daughters b'day. It was fabulous! Even my husband, who isn't a huge cheesecake fan, liked it. I will be making this again!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Very easy and delicious. It was a big hit at our bbq.
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Made this recipe exactly as written for a graduation party. It was a huge hit and was gone in no time. Wouldn't change a thing. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#OMG - SO easy and SO delicious!! This was my first time to make cheesecake - I was scared but it was so simple and tasted fabulous : ) Def will make it again and again
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I doubled the recipe and made it in a 10x14-inch pan. I needed to make it gluten-free, so I used only GF graham crumbs, increasing the amount to total both kinds of crumbs. Instead of hot fudge topping stirred into the chocolate layer, I melted dark chocolate into some milk and stirred it into 1/3 of the batter. I left 1/3 plain, and I stirred the peanut butter into the other 1/3. I layered them in the pan, chocolate on bottom, plain in the middle, and PB on top. I baked it about an hour and 10 minutes. Tomorrow I'll melt chocolate in milk again and put it on top as a ganache, with PB cups chopped on top. (I used the recipe on this page to make GF PB cups: https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/homemade-peanut-butter-cups.) I actually had some crumbs left over from doubling the recipe, so I made a tiny cheesecake in a grab-it dish and sampled it. Delicious! 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This cheesecake was delicious! Made it according to the recipe with the exception of the chocolate cookies - used chocolate wafers instead of sandwich cookies and it worked like a dream. Brought it to work and there's nothing left but crumbs! 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Made it for my co-workers and everyone loved it!! It wasn't hard to make at all. I used a 9x13 pan instead of a 9 springform pan and it was excellent. I'm making this for the Holidays. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This is amazing! I used Reese's Oreos. Hubby loves it. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I make this for many charity auctions it's a big ticket item. The most it has sold for is S295 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Yummy!!! I just made this for a Christmas party. I did add some creamy PB to the main batter, after removing the cup that is mixed with the fudge. I also replaced some of the graham cracker crumbs for more oreo crumbs, just to make it a little more chocolatey. I had no problem with too much batter as one review stated and I used a 9 springform. So delicious - one of my new favorites!! 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I made a few substitutions which created a lovely taste sensation. First, I made a crushed pretzel thins and butter crust. Second, I substituted 1/4 C caramel ice cream topping and 1/4 C chocolate syrup for the reserved 1 C filling in place of the fudge topping. Finally, I chopped 4 Reese's cups and put them IN the vanilla batter. None on top. Did it turn out? You bet it did and it was fabulous. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#It's been awhile since I made this cheesecake but it's amazing. Just can't remember if you have to take creme out of Oreo cookies before crushing for the crust.?? 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I've made this cheesecake several times and I love it and have always gotten rave reviews. It is quite a bit of work, but I find it most worth it. I do use a larger 10 1/2 springform pan. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Great cheesecake, but unfortunately, and I'm surprised no one else has mentioned it, this recipe yields enough cheesecake filling to easily do two 9 cakes. Wish I had known beforehand, as I just kept saying to myself The recipe has to be right as I kept noticing that there seemed to be way too much while I was mixing the ingredients, and I wound up washing 40% of the filling down the sink, and over filling the one pan & crust I did have, and the cheesecake ballooned up and split in several deep crevices because of this. Get your amounts correct next time please. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Delicious...easy to make and it looks great. Everyone at the party loved it.
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#The recipe is delicious. The only complaint is that from all the chocolate on top is that it was very messy, but overall very tasty
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I might be in the minority, but this cheesecake was not as good as I thought it would be. I am confused by the name because it tastes nothing like a peanut butter cup. The peanut butter flavor is hardly evident and the fudge poured on top doesn't add much to the flavor. Except for the pb cups for garnishes, where is the comparison to a pb cup? The crust came out hard, too and I didn't overbake it. I just was not thrilled with this cheesecake. It's not worth all the trouble, so I don't think I would bother making it again. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Unreal amount of deliciousness.
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I made this for Christmas. IMPRESSIVE. But very rich, although we managed to eat it all! I did omit the peanut butter in the crust. Loved the crust and will use it in my next cheesecake.
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#dpauly123--I leave my cheese cake in the springform until I'm ready to serve it. So yes, cool it in the pan. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Could someone answer if the cheesecake remains in the springform pan overnight while cooling? Ive experienced that my fall if taken out too soon. It is asking me to rate, but I haven't tried it yet! 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This cheesecake is a must for our parties. I substituted mini peanut butter cups for the chopped and it makes the finished product extra pretty!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I have made this cheese cake year after year for my son's birthday. It's sooo good! 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Great recipe. I would not change anything!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Five stars aren't enough. I'm always looking for new cheesecake recipes. This was delicious. Definitely will make again, and again. I wouldn't change a thing. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Great recipe. To cut down (?) just a little on the calories I used peanut butter chips instead of the cups on the top. But still the best peanut butter cheesecake recipe EVER...
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Substitutions I made: - Peak Freans Lifestyle cookies (dark chocolate/cherry) instead of graham cracker crumbs+sandwich cookies. I just used 1 cup and a half of the Lifestyles cookies and it was delish. - Instead of hot fudge ice cream topping, I used nutella. ALSO DELICIOUS. - I noticed that the peanut butter really did not make an appearance in the final product (maybe I did something wrong), but the peanut oil seeped out of the springform pan and onto the cookie sheet. Which I don't think was a problem, but maybe add more peanut butter? OR perhaps mix it into the batter? - I misread the instructions, and melted butter for the crust, but then (Stupidly) measured out 6 tbsps of the melted stuff and only put that in. The crust was definitely drier than I would've liked, it, so don't make the same mistake as me. Always add a lot of butter. -I also didn't have an electric mixer, which resulted in a pretty lumpy batter. Luckily I had some extra muscle on hand to stir it up, but I think an electric mixer would have made things easier :p - I added cut up peanut butter cups into the batter (before I poured the chocolate part on) and it was SUCH a good idea. They melted into the cake, and it was impossible to see them, but they definitely made the cake richer and more velvety. They added a distinct peanut butter cup taste. Very good. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#The crust - a mix of graham crackers and oreos - is what sets this cheesecake apart from the rest. It is delicious! My mother-in-law loves peanut butter and she can't get enough of this rich, creamy cheesecake. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I'm not a great baker or dessert chef, but this recipe made me look like I am! It turned out beautifully, really rich and decadent. Next time I will try replacing one or two of the bars of cream cheese with the light cream cheese. My son and I had a great time making this together. It did take me much longer to prepare than the stated prep time, but other than that, no complaints! 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#My husband LOVE anything with peanut butter but he's not a big fan of cheesecake. This he loves. Great recipe! 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Very good recipe.Unfortunately, the prep time is not realistic. Started it at 9:30 at night, and got it to the refrigerator after midnight.
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#OK this is what i said when i saw how many views it has holy fudge!! it looks so good!!!!!!!!!!!my mom loves PB cup!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:) :):) :) 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I made this recipe for our Christmas Eve dessert and it was a huge hit. Everyone loved it and they have been asking me to make it again and again. I do not usually take the time to rate recipes but this one was so good I felt I had to.
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This is a cheesecake that always gets requested over & over!!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Truly enjoyed this cheesecake. It was creamy and smooth and a great peanut butter taste -- one of the family's favorite. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I would make this again. It turned out Perfect
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Mason makes this divine cheesecake for his mother! Thank you son;)
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I feel kind of bad being the only one so far to really think this cheesecake wasn't that amazing. I think I was expecting more of the peanut butter cup taste all through out it and it wasn't really what I was looking for. I wouldn't mind trying it again, but instead of putting the peanutbutter on the bottom, fold it into the cream cheese filling, or both : ) I'm just not a big fan of plain cheesecake and this was more plain tasting than I would like. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This is one of the best cheesecakes I have ever made and it is definitely the one I make most often. I made this for an office party and now I am not allowed to bring anything else. It has been a hit wherever I take it. It is somewhat time-consuming so make sure you give yourself plenty of time to finish. Cooling completely before refrigeration is key. It really is as good as it looks.
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I have made this cheesecake over and over again. It is so delicious. One of my husbands favorites. It always gets rave reviews wherever I take it.
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#amazing!!!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I just finished this cheesecake for a co-worker's birthday. I can already tell it's going to be a HUGE hit. I can't wait to serve this tomorrow! 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Totally decadent!! Made it for my in-laws and they proclaimed it to be restaurant quality . I didn't change a thing and thought it was pretty easy. I may do a water bath next time to prevent cracks (or allow myself more time, it had to be put in the fridge overnight without fully cooling outside of the oven first). It was wonderful, thank you for sharing it. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I won a !desert tasting with this one
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This is the best cheesecake, ever!!! I love making this, love eating it even more!!!!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I made this for Thanksgiving and my whole family loved it and there were no left-overs!!!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Absolutely Amazing!!! I made this the morning of Thanksgiving, we ate it that evening. Pardon the pun, but each bite could've given a heart attack, it is absolutely scrumptious. Also pretty easy to create as well. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This was an amazing Peanut Butter Cheesecake! Was easy to do also. Was devoured shortly after i cut into it for Thanksgving at my friends house!!!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Delicious! Worth the time put into it.
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This is one of the most decadent cheesecakes I have ever had!!! Everyone loved it and I've already had 3 requests to make this again! Delicious!!!!! 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I made this cheesecake for a birthday party and it was a big hit with all of the guests! I used miniature peanut butter cups cut in half. The birthday girl asked for the recipe!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This recipe was a major hit! Have already made several of them!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#OMG! This cheesecake was positively sinful! Everyone loved it!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This is one of those recipes that my family keeps requesting. Made it for a holiday gathering a few years ago, and everyone is still talking about it!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Have made this several times and always a hit. MY family likes it when I add peanut butter cups on top of the peanut butter layer.
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Holy Cheesecake! This was amazingly good! I made it for my Valentine, and He LOVED IT! Keep in mind this is very rich, but full of peanut butter and chocolate flavor! Took some time to make, but I will definately make this again!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#this turned out so good. I cant wait to make it again. Instead of using the fudge for the top I used the Reese's shell for ice cream. worked great 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This is sooooo good. Everyone just loved it.
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#DELICIOUS! This is one of the best cheesecakes I have ever tasted. You can't go wrong with peanut butter and chocolate! I made it according to the directions except I doubled the reese's cups on top. I took it to a Thanksgiving carryin and everyone raved about it. Just make sure everyone sees it when it is whole because cutting it ruins the pretty look! My slices looked nothing like the photo! But that's why magazines have food stylists! Most amazing flavor and I will definitely be making it again! The only thing I might change is the crust and make an all oreo crust! 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I first made this recipe years ago when it was on the cover of TOH, and I made my husband take a picture of me with my finished product and my TOH cover. This cheesecake is a little time consuming, but worth every second. It looks so wonderful on a table atop a pedestal plate, and it tastes every bit as good as it looks.
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This cheesecake is stunning and delicious. I've made it twice to use as gifts and the recipients raved. I use a few more Reeses than the recipe calls for to get that WOW appearance on top. Recommend this recipe highly. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I made this for a friend who has had lots of things I've baked and she always likes them a lot - but this she declared as her absolute favorite! She brought one small piece home to her family and they all fought over it. She's already requesting it for her birthday again next year. I have to agree it was amazing. I did not change one thing in the recipe. If you're a chocolate peanut butter fan who also likes cheesecake, you have to try this! One warning, though. I made homemade fudge sauce for the top, but the recipe I have gets hard when chilled. Luckily, I had time to go to the store and buy a jar because the other would have been too hard to cut through without tearing the cake apart. For once, a store-bought ingredient was better than homemade. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving. It is DELICIOUS!! Everyone loved it...they couldn't believe I made it...they all thought it was from the Cheesecake Factory. I will definitely make it again. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Everyone loved this and I've had requests to make it again. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Made for a party and it got AMAZING results. It's true what other say -- it needs to be served in small pieces. The host kept the remainder and wound up freezing it. Apparently this recipe is so good frozen, it makes the original obsolete. I will now use this as a frozen dessert. FREEZE IT!!!!! 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I made this recipe for work and it was a big hit. Everybody loved it! It did take some time to make, but it was all worth it.
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This is absolutely to die for!!! I am a huge fan of cheesecake and this is amazing. I have made it for friends and they just loved it also. It is one of my top favorite dessert recipes!!!! It is very easy to make too.
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I always receive rave reviews when I make this, so it's worth the hassle. It's amazing in taste and visually stunning. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I personally don't like cheesecake but I made it for a birthday party and everyone LOVED it. The only thing is...it came out pretty attractive but not nearly as neat looking as the photo. 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I made this for my mothers Birthday, and it was a big hit.
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#i used the smaller cups
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Just made it, very easy just alot of steps, looking forward to trying it. Yummy! looks pretty too, i added 4-5 more peanut butter cups
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This cheesecake is to die for! This one goes in my recipe file. I took this to a a meeting and everyone absolutely loved it.
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#i whant to try it

Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Oh this was so good!!! I have had MANY compliments!!!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I made this for birthday to bring in to work. It was soooo delicious. I also made it for my Fiances birthday as well. It's one of the best cheesecakes I've ever made and tasted :):):):) 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#This was so good! It received many rave reviews! I am not much of a cheesecake person, but absolutely loved this! It is very rich, though, so eat small slices! This took a while to make, but well worth it!
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I chose this cheesecake as my very first baked cheesecake for Thanksgiving last year. It turned out perfect and it is very good! I didn't add the chocolate on top; one, I didn't want to cover up the swirl design, and two, it really didn't need anyhing else. The cheesecake is creamy and rich...just the way a cheesecake should be. You definitely do not need a large slice of this! 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I made this for my boss on my last day of work needless to say she had to share with everyoneI have never heard so many RAVE reviews!! Everybody loved it even those that didn't think they liked cheesecake but they did say it was rich but very good!!! I am making it again very soon for my son and my future daughter-in-law!! 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I really liked this cheesecake, but it is very rich. It's not real great for after a big meal! But it is delicious if you have an empty stomach 
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#My little sister made this cheesecake and it was gone by the next morning! This was absolutely delicious!Priscilla :)
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#I have made this wonderful cheesecake several times and everyone always enjoys it so, one of my passions is making cheesecakes and this one turns out every time !!marvin
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake#0#0#Wow! Thanks for posting it sounds and looks wonderful!! Nancy 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#2#1#This was pretty simple to make. What I found I didn't care for was the filling that went into the apples. The white sugar/cornstarch/water/melted butter left an odd flavor, bland and odd at the same time. Maybe instead of white sugar, I would use brown sugar with some spices such as cinnamon, maybe some nutmeg. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#3#0#I love a crumb topping like this on apple pie and was excited to make it. Went together fine and liked not having to get out the rolling pin. I cooked the sugar, corn starch and water for the filling in the microwave---so easy that way them added the apples. I also added 1 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t. nutmeg because of personal preferences. Flavor was excellent. My complaint is that the topping got very soggy quickly. Maybe it was kind of apples I used or fact that I stored pie in a Tupperware pie container with a tight fitting lid. Anyway, I am going to make another pie shortly to take to a gathering tonight.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#1#Very simple recipe that results in a sweet & crowd-pleasing dessert. After an initial tasting there wasn't enough flavor for my household's taste, so we added 1/4tsp ginger, 1/8tsp nutmeg, 1tsp cinnamon, and 2tbs lemon juice to the filling. Overall I loved how simple this recipe was, and it was a great base to add an apple-pie spice mixture to. All the roommates enjoyed it =) 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#2#1#I made this yesterday and followed the recipe exactly, except for adding 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the filling before adding the apples. I used a glass pie pan and baked for 45 minutes. It came out perfect. The 1-1/2 cups for the topping was spot on. I thought the apples could have cooked a little longer, I used Gala, next time I might try a different one. I will definitely be making this again.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I made this recipe with just a few minor changes..... I added sweetened dried cranberries to the apple mixture (for the color), I used margarine instead of butter and I sprinkled the top with cinnamon. I must say, this is an easy recipe to make and it's delicious! 5 stars for sure!! 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This was soooo good, and very easy. I am NOT a baker but the boys requested apple pie for Thanksgiving dessert, and I just can't stomach the store-bought pies/fillings. I did add cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling and chopped pecans to the topping, which turned out great. Will definitely make this one again. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#1#This recipe knocked it out of the park for me!!! I am not even a pie lover but this was extremely good. Also, the easiest pie I have ever made! Love the you do not have to roll out a crust and the topping is made right with the crust so there is no extra step to make the topping. Yes, I added cinnamon, woopy doo, this recipe deserves a 10 star in my book!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#4#I am sorry to say this! There are Some ingredients missing! I am Dutch and this is no Dutch Apple pie (appeltaart).
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#1#0#I really liked this pie! My first attempt was less than great, but some was my own fault. I forgot the vanilla, but the amount of apples also seemed far too many for the size of the pie pan. I had apples and sauce overflowing! Even so, it tasted OK and was easy to do, so I tried it again. My second effort I limited it to 2 cups of apples, mixed granny smith and golden delicious. I made certain to include the vanilla, and also added a bit of cinnamon to the apples. In addition, bc I have a real sweet tooth, I added an additional 1/2 c brown sugar to the topping portion. This adjustment turned out GREAT! I made one for myself and took one to a church dinner. Thanks. I plan to make another for Christmas dinner.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This is a quick and easy recipe! I added brown sugar and cinnamon and salt to the apple mixture. It turned out really good. I have noticed on alot of recipes I find on line, there is always something missing.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Hubby was craving apple pie and I ran across this in my August/September Simple & Delicious mag. Looked easy and with few ingredients. The only thing we needed was the apples. Got some Granny Smiths and followed the recipe except for adding some cinnamon to the apple mixture. I couldn't figure out why that was left out of the original recipe. Anyway, it came out TERRIFIC! Oh so tasty and the crust is wonderful. Perfect recipe! I've already printed and saved it and it is now my go-to recipe. Hubby absolutely LOVED it and he's picky about his apple pie. LOL! Thanks Brenda DuFrense for sending it in. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#1#0#This was so easy - love the preparation technique for the crust and topping! I thought it needed some spice so next time I made it I added in 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon to the flour mixture. I also added 1/2 cup chopped nuts (typically peans or walnuts), and I thought this provided some nice crunch. I will definitely make this pie again!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This pie was easy to prepare. The no roll crust and topping is delicious. As I was making this pie, I noticed it did not call for any cinnamon. After reading several other reviews, I decided to add some cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling. I would also reserve more like 1 1/2 cups of the crust mixture for the topping.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Yummy!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I would have given this 5 stars, however, it definitely lacks cinnamon and nutmeg! I should have read the reviews before I made it. I think with those additions, this would be a 10 star pie! LOVE the crust! I love that it adds more texture and flavor vs a standard crust. I might even add some finely chopped walnuts or pecans to the streusel topping!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Big hit this Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. Easy to make. Will make again for Christmas.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#made exactly as set out in recipe except added one teaspoon of cinnamon to filling. prep was easy and straight forward. enjoyed the pie filling but did not like the crust. the taste of butter was overwhelming. in the future I may prepare standard scratch pie crust with this filling.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#1#0#Did not like it at all/
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Good pie recipe but I really loved the crust. Will use this to make other types of pie instead of the regular graham cracker crust.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#1#0#I made this today...not hard to make at all versus making pie crust from scratch. This pie was very good! I added cinnamon also as I read in the reviews...goes good with apple pie! Thank you for sharing! This recipe is a keeper :)
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I have made this for years and it is a family favorite! I do add a little cinnamon to apples.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#My daughter helped me make this and she loved it. Super easy to make without a complicated pie crust!!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Great recipe with a few slight tweaks (I've made this for family gatherings or when I just want a comfort food dessert) you need to add some cinnamon and nutmeg and you'll have one heck of a Dutch Apple Pie. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Easy, delicious, and worth trying
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#1#0#My family loved this! The filling recipe is great for a two crust pie as well as Dutch Apple. Filling held together well, didn't run when pie was cut. I added a little cinnamon to the filling for a bit more flavor. I'm adding this to my recipe box! 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Have made this pie twice, added apple pie spice, and it has been a hit both times. Will make it again and again...
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Super easy and yummy! I little sweet, so next time I'll use a little less sugar. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This pie is very good, mostly due to the crust. I followed the recipe exactly as written except I added cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice to the crumb mixture and the filing thanks to the reviewers. I also added pecans to the topping. Will definitely make again.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Total disaster! I did EXACTLY as the recipe stated. The only salvageable thing was the crust. It looked like a cornstarch slurry mess. I will never make this again.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Made this pie and thought it was really good. Did like the crust, it reminded me of a cookie. I also liked the filling a lot, was very good, seemed like an apple pie filling you'd find in a pre-made apple pie. For some reason my pie crust was pretty thick even though I used 9 inch pie plate. My crust came out really hard also. I think I may have cooked a little too long. I noticed no one else had this problem so I'm sure it was on my end. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#My friend and I like to get together and bake new recipes once a month. Today we made this and the filling is perfectly sweet and tart. We added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/8th teaspoon to the filling and cut the vanilla to a small splash. The crust is perfect for people who love pie but hate making crust. Will totally make this again.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I made the pie the night before and then baked it during dinner so it would be warm for dessert. It came out perfect. The only thing i did was add cinnamon to the filling and little to the crust as well. I also used Honeycrisp apples. Fantastic!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#i made this last year for thanksgiving and it turned out great.. i just wanted to know if you can make it the night before... anybody please help..
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I just used the crumb topping because I have a great recipe for apple pie. This topping was delicious. I can't wait to make it again. Maybe today! 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Wonderful ! Family loved it ! Used red delicious apples, turned out BEAUTIFULLY!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#The crust and topping are AMAZING! Even my family members that say the don't like pie love this recipe!! The filling was a little bland though so I added cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice to give it more of an apple pie flavor. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I made the pie for the first 3 times using the recipe, it was really good. After that I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and I used orange juice instead of water. OMG try it.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Omg i was so proud of myself when i made my favorite pie myself mmm it was great..
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I made this for the first time, and my girlfriend Absolutely LOVED it! It's DELICIOUS, and the crust.... words just simply can't describe how Incredibly Delicious the crust really is!!!!!!!!!!! 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Added a bit more vanilla. It was fantastic!!!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Delish! Added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I tried this recipe a couple weeks ago and I knew with the first bite it was going to be my favorite thing to make so everyone I love has gotten a pie!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I followed the recipe exactly and like it a lot. The flavor profile is unexpected and very different but I enjoyed it. I do intend to try it again but without the glaze and vanilla using sugar, flour, cinnamon and nutmeg. I absolutely love the crust!!!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I gave this four stars because it needed tweaking. I wouldn't even consider making a dessert with apples without cinnamon. So yes, I did the same. I added a tsp of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I also had some trouble with the cornstarch clumping up in the water no matter how long I boiled the water. So I wound up with a few gummy clumps in my pie. So next time I make this I would have to add the cornstarch slowly. Also, I baked mine for 40 mins and it was too long. My crust was hard and it was darker brown (not like the picture)...but then again, I should have known because that is how my oven is...SO YES, I would definitely make this again and just bake it for less time and would also solve my cornstarch problem. The flavor was great WITH the added spices. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#In the Netherlands we call this kind of Pie oma's appel Taart a Nan's apple Pie in english but in all Dutch apple pies there will be Cinnamon in it.For a twist add about 100gr (about 4 ounces) raisins into apple mix. It taste delicious 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Great crust and topping, but where is the cinnamon? I added cinnamon and nutmeg and got some great reviews from family and friends. I didn't cook the apples, I just added them to the filling and this turned out fine. I slice my apples thin so this probably helped. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This is a great easy recipe for people on the go, or who have never done an apple pie before. I have to agree with the other folks. Make your pie filling with spices or it will be bland. I didn't cook my filling. I went old school and dumped the raw apples, cornstarch, and everything in a bowl, mixed it together, and it baked up just fine. One tip I think you may find useful is you can also use instant oatmeal packets. Just cut back on the brown sugar for the topping (I used 1/2 cup packed brown sugar). Also, I doubled the recipe for the crust and the topping using 2 packets of Apple Cinnamon oatmeal for each, for a deep dish pie. I just found that saving a cup wasn't enough for the topping, but boy was it delicious! I used a combination of 3 each Jonathan and granny smith apples and it turned out mighty tasty. Great starter recipe to build on or to make on the fly. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#As a pie lover, it is difficult for a pie to really impress me. This recipe not only impressed me, it changed me. I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the glaze as other reviewers suggested. Other than that, everything was perfect. The glaze was just the right amount to perfectly coat the apples with no excess remaining.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Definitely would add cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice to jazz it up. Tastes a lot like a apple pie crumble.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This recipe is wonderful! I used the crust and topping part of the recipe with the apple pie filling I had frozen (https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/apple-pie-filling) and the two recipes complimented each other perfectly! I will definitely make it again and am also anxious to try the whole recipe when our apple tree bears again this fall.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Awesome! So easy to make and it tasted incredible. (I did add a bit of cinnamon.) We served with ice cream.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This is the Best Apple Pie Ever! My friends and family always request this. I follow the recipe exactly, no changes needed, the flavor is great. I make 10-12 every fall and freeze them for the rest of the winter
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#great and easy. Must add spices or its bland.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I took this pie to Thanksgiving and had never even attempted an apple pie. Wow, was it a hit!! There was one piece left when we were done and my dad claimed it for himself before anyone else could! I also added about 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. This pie is super easy and especially DELICIOUS!!!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Wonderfully delicious and easy! I think this has become my families favorite apple pie. The only thing I did different with the recipe is to add lots of cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling. I also sometimes add toasted pecans to the topping. It's an easy enough recipe that anyone who can chop apples can make this . 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Easy and tastes great, I had cinnamon too to the filling
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Beyond delicious! This is our new favorite dessert. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the apple mixture as we love the taste of apples and cinnamon. Will return to this recipe often!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Made this recipe the other night and it turned out wonderful! I took advice from a previous review and added chopped pecans to the'pie crust' and was not disappointed.The filling set up perfect and the crust stayed together and was easily lifted out of the pie plate.This will be my'go to' apple pie recipe from now on.Thanks again TOH for another great recipe! 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I forgot to mention that it was delicious and everyone loved it.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I made this for my Granddaughters graduation party and unfortunately, there was not enough. I might try to double recipe and make in 9x13 pan next time. I also added 4 cups of apples, l/2 t cinnamon, l/4 t nutmeg and a sml spot of lemon juice
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I have made this pie many times over the years. It is NOT a traditional apple pie as it contains no cinnamon, but it's still yummy! We like to eat warm slices along with vanilla ice cream. -Lori in WI. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#My dad's favorite dessert has always been apple pie. Several years ago my sister and I went apple picking and went searching for a good apple pie recipe to make with the apples we got for our dad. This is the ABSOLUTE BEST PIE EVER!!! My dad fell in love and now we make it for every family gathering, holiday and birthday. Over the years we have spiced it up quite a bit by adding cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling. We also add crushed pecans to the crust which is a great addition! We have also on occasion added dried cranberries to the filling!!! This pie is easy and delicious, I highly recommend it. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Fantastic! Easy to follow and quick. I added cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. Will make again and again!http://www.mynewlywedcookingadventures.com/2013/02/taste-of-homes-dutch-apple-pie.html
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#So creamy and delicious!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I own a small organic apple farm and I am always trying new recipes.This pie was easy and delicious.I did make the filling sauce with my home made apples juice and I added cinnamon.This will be my new go to recipe for apple pie. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I made this pie. It was great!!! It was easy.!! My family loved it. I will be making this pie again.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#1#0#This pie was easy to put together but very sweet. It seemed to be missed something so next time I will add cinnamon and nutmeg as other readers suggested. It has a lot of potential and I loved the crust!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I made this last night... it was the worst pie. It tasted so disgusting. Something wasnt right with the filling. It had a weir taste. All I can say it was HORRIBLE. Threw the pie out.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#If you make this pie, listen the advice of the kind reviewers and add some spices. I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling and the crumbs, and sprinkled more cinnamon on top to make it pretty. I would call it Apple Crisp Pie. I used a 9.5 inch pie plate, and it was quite full. My bottom crust became hard which made it hard to eat with a fork. I'm starting to think my oven runs a little hot, so I'll need to decrease the cooking time or turn it down 10 degrees. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Made this in hopes of taking it to my church for Thanksgiving dinner......THE WORST pie ever!!! I've made many regular pies that ALWAYS come out ideal. This one burnt around the edges, was THIN after stirring in the apples and vanilla. It ran over in my oven....a COMPLETE waste of my time and money. Never again! 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#1#0#While the pie was quick to put together, it just tasted sort of blah. I will make this again, but will add spices to the filling. As written, the filling has a strange sweet, jelly texture that lacks interest.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Since there was no cinnamon, nutmeg, or apple pie spice in this recipe there was really no flavor. Crust was good but if I make again I will be adding the spices.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This my favorite apple pie recipe it is easy to put together and oh so delicious
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#When I find a recipe online, I always look at the comments to see what others said about it before I commit to making it. I agree with most comments that this was absolutely DELICIOUS! The only thing I changed was when making the filling, I added a little more than 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves. I added it as soon as I turned on the burner, and whisked it in, a little at a time. I will be making this often!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I made this for the first time yesterday for after dinner and not a single crumb was left.Thank you, it was great!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I've made this twice so far, and everyone who has tasted it absolutely LOVED it! I added cinnamon to the filling. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#The best pie of this type I have ever made. This will probably be my go to recipe for apple pie. I used Rome apples and added a few sprinkles of spices. I used pumpkin pie spices since I was out of apple pie spices ( they are basically the same ). The family loved this pie.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#1#0#something is off with the filling, wonderful crust and topping though
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This is possible the best apple pie anyone I have ever served it to has eve had after making a few changes. For deep dish, I doubled the oats, used 1/1 4 cups butter and used alittle more flour for the crust and topping. I also omitted the water cornstrach method althogether, but added alittle lemon juice to the apples instead. I mixed same amount of tapioca, as cornstarch, into apples(which can be increased along with sugar depending on pan side) along with the sugar and put the vanilla in apples too; decreased the oven temp to 325-335 and baked until apples were done. I also covered the edges with tin foil from the start. Never stayed on the counter very long. Yum Yum
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I've made the pie many, many times and make these adjustments every time: I use brown sugar instead of white, add cinnamon, vanilla, butter and a dash of lemon juice to the filling after it's thickened. It's always a hit! 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#OMG!!! This was so good! Hubby doesn't want any other apple pie. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I love the pie crust so much that I used it with another recipe, but I didn't like the filling. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I have made this pie several times over the years, and people actually request it. If you love fruit crisps, you will like this pie. It is best eaten fairly soon after you make it, as the topping starts to draw moisture from the fruit.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Great recipe, I did change it up some, I used 1/2 cup brown sugar blend (splenda) and 1/2 splenda in place of the sugar in the filling.and I used about 6-8 cups apple&gt; I love more filling in my pie. also added cinnamon and nutmeg. with the pie filling. It was so goood that it never had a chance to cool off.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I recall making this pie and I adjusted the recipe by using 1/2 cup either regular or quick oats, 1/4 tsp. ground ginger, 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg and 1 TO 2 tsp. ground cinnamon. I found this recipe very simple to prepare! delowenstein
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#When this particular recipe did come out, I had prepared it and it was really good! Dawn E. Lowenstein
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Very good. I increased the receipe ingredients to make it deep disn. Of course I increased the cooking time. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon to the syrup mix for a more thanksgiving/fall flavor.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This pie is very heavy on crust/topping. It definitely needs some flavoring - cinnamon, nutmet, etc. Very bland. Will not make again.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Loved the pie, I used 1/2 cup brown sugar blend, and only 1/2 cup splenda, I also used some cinnamon and nutmeg in the apple mix. It Was delicious!!!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This actually makes a much better apple crisp! I just place apples in the bottom of a baking dish and sprinkle the crust portion on top. I also add 1 tsp cinnamon when making the apple mixture.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#First pie I've ever made. Turned out perfect. Tart and juicy, but not to sweet and gooey. Will definitely be making this again. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#very tasty, not real sweet, I added cinnamon and sugar to the apples before putting them together with the cornstarch and water.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Very Good loved the topping
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#this is a large and tasty pie. I added a little cinnamon and will try other fruits and berries when I make it again.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This has become one of my favorite apple pie recipes
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This is quite tasty, but I found the crust a little too dense for my liking. However, it is still quite good, and I agree that it is easy and quick. Much less intimidating than a standard crust. My husband liked it a lot.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#First apple pie I have ever made, and it turned out great!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Husband loved this recipe!!!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#My husband and I enjoyed this dessert. I added cinnamon, since we both like it with apple desserts. Will make it again.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This pie was so yummy and amazingly easy to make. We harvested our apple tree and wanted to try something new, but were a bit intimidated by standard pie crust. This came together easily, pressed into the pie plate in no time at all, and was so delish! We added a little cinnamon to both the crust and the apple mixture. Yum!!!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I've been making this recipe for a few years now. I've also make it using pitted Door County cherries & using the cherry juice from the cherries instead of water. it's delicious!!! 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I have made this pie for years, and it is one of my favorite fast homemade recipes. It's a good one for new or young cooks to try because it's easy, yet it looks much more difficult than it is, so it's a good one to use to impress the in-laws or others. I also add a little cinnamon to the apples. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#tasty! I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and I also added 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon when I stirred in the apples and vanilla into the cornstarch mixture.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Yes, the crust is a little dense as others have mentioned, but it is very easy to make and it is tasty. I also happened to have made it with Door County cherries and like that too. This is currently my pie recipe of choice because the crust is so easy to make and tasty and doesn't have a bunch of chemicals in it like a store bought pre-made crust. Making a traditional crust is sometimes a hassle that doesn't always turn out well (for me anyways). 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#YUM! I'm so glad there were leftovers after my hubby took it for his friends! Really great. How, regarding the spices--it was only AFTER I began baking that I realized the filling contained no spices. In shock, I ran to read all the reviews and saw nearly everyone added them, so I did too. I added Cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. It tasted AMAZING. Without the spices the filling was VERY bland.The crust on the other hand--wow! Very fattening and high in sugar, but WOW! Deffo a recipe I will return to regularly. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#My whole family enjoys this for dessert!! I've made it several times for pot luck events and always receive rave reviews. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I am not a pie crust lover, and neither is my husband, so we look for recipes that have an alternative crust - this pie was absolutely delicious and a big hit at the family Thanksgiving Dinner. I will definitely be making this again!!! Thank you for sharing this with us!!!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#My husband doesn't care for apple pie, but he really liked this. I will make this again. I also put cinnamon in it because we like cinnamon in apple desserts. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#It would have gotten 5 stars if there were more spices in the filling though. I follow this recipe then add cinnamon, clove, allspice & ginger to taste...its a hit!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Great! Wonderful flavor. Added walnuts to top crumb mixture.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Absolutely delicious! We had it for Thanksgiving dinner..my daughter added walnuts to the topping..yum!!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I may never make a regular crust again. This is a great pie. I added about teaspoon of salt to the filling. Then I added a teaspoon of salt and cinnamon to the crust. Accidentally I put the apples in with the water and starch and it still worked.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This is the BEST apple dessert I have ever made or tasted! I added 1 Tblsp of cinnamon to the dry mix and also 1 Tablsp. cinnamon to the filling,also added 3Tablsp. caramel ice cream topping to the mixture along with the vanilla..It was SO YUMMY!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Quick and easy recipe. Wonderful taste. My parents don't even like apple pie, but they very much enjoyed this one! 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I was really disappointed with this, particularly after reading all the rave reviews. I won't make the filling again because it was tasteless even after adding spices and didn't set right, but I will be using the crust recipe (a 3/4 recipe) for the next pie I make. Perhaps that will turn out better.Reserving just a cup for topping left the crust really thick, so I reserved about 1 3/4 cup, which turned out nicely. I used 2 different kinds of apples to get a flavor blend and sprinkled some cinnamon and nutmeg on the bottom crust before putting the apple mixture in. Unfortunately, this still didn't really give the filling any flavor. I was amazed at how thick the water/cornstarch/sugar mixture got after boiling, but it was really jelly-like when I took it out of the oven. I was worried that it wouldn't set as it cooled, and it didn't really.I will say though, that EVERY TOH pie recipe I read calls for a 9 pie dish, but EVERY ONE I make NEEDS a 9.5 Deep Dish pan. Don't believe what you read in the recipe; it doesn't fit in the smaller dish. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I would bake it a touch longer because I prefer the apples softer but the taste was terrific and I like the oatmeal in the crust. It reminds me of a pie and apple crisp rolled into one!!!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#As a'real' born and raised Dutchie I never put any extra sugar in this pie. I don't like it so sweet it needs to be a little sweet and a little sour (of applles or lemonjuice) instead - it's ment to be a fresh treat. That's the reason why I only use sugar in the'dough', together with the apples I mix in some cinnamon and lemonjuice (spoon) - it's toooo yammie ... with whipped cream! Enjoy. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#My husband said this was the best apple pie he's had. I added cinnamon and nutmeg and used an extra apple and a little less sugar in the filling. The apples were fresh tasting and the crust was crunchy and delicious. I'll be making this again! 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Absolutely fantastic- family loved it-did add maple syrup to apples and did cut back on the cornstarch by 1 tablespoon- worked out great.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This is a big favorite in our house. It was the first pie recipe both our daughters baked; so easy with the pat-in-the-pan crust. Sometimes if we're short on fresh fruit we'll make it with canned apple pie filling. Delicious, and even more so with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This pie is easy to make and great when you don't feel like rolling out pastry. I added cinnamon to it and everyone loved it. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Very tasty and good. It didn't last long at my table 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I have made this too many times to count. It's so amazingly good that I have had people request it over and over again. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Amazing, EASY apple pie recipe! I was looking for a quick and easy recipe to try and found it! The pie has all the flavors of a traditional apple pie but takes 1/2 the time! I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the syrup to add some more fall essence... overall an award winning recipe! 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This is the best apple pie I have ever tasted in my life. I am making it again right now. The old guy at the apple barn told us to use baking apples- they sure do make a difference! I give this one six stars
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This is the ONLY Apple Pie Recipe that my husband wants me to make, and I make it a lot! I sometimes cook the apples a little to soften and add cinnamon/nutmeg to the mix as well.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This apple pie rocks!! Both my husband and I love it. I will make it often and give the recipe to friends and relatives. I may try peaches instead of apples.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I did take the advice of other reviewers and added 1 tsp. Apple Pie Spice -- Delish!!! It was fast and easy to make and I love the crumble mixture for the crust. Will definitely be making more of these throughout the apple harvest!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I rated this Good because the topping and the crust were good because it was different but there was to much sugar in this recipe so I will try it again with less sugar.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#My family loved this apple pie. This is a simple recipe. I substitued Brown Sugar Splenda in the crust but not in the filling. I also added about 1/2 tsp of apple pie spice to the filling to give it a little more flavor. It turned out perfectly!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Delicious! I'm not a huge fan of traditional pie crust, so this is my new favorite apple pie! 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Thi is absolutely the best apple pie recipe! My guests just raved about it and are already asking me to make it again. The oat and brown sugar crust really sets it apart.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#We love apple desserts and I make this several times a month. I bake it in a 9 X 13 pan and cut it in squares. Its even great without spices. I also add chopped pecans occasionaly to the crumb mixture.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I love this recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving and even my mother-in-law was loving it! Def will make again. Very easy to transform into a gluten-free recipe.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This was delicious and super easy to make...It turned out great and everyone loved it!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This pie is easy to make and delicious but I have made it twice and could not get it out of the pie plate either time. Although the recipe said not to grease the pie plate, I did so both times. What am I doing wrong? Help, please!
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This pie looks absolutely delicious and I will be making it for my family. I know they will love it.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Just need alittle apple pie spice and it's great. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#This pie tasted ok , but the filling from the cornstarch mixture was very unappealing with the clear gel surrounding the diced apples. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#this was really really good,i will make this again.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I'm Diabetic so I replaced the sugar with Splenda. I also have changed the 2/3 Cups Sugar to 1/3 Splenda Brown Sugar and 1/3 regular Splenda. The Brown Sugar added a really good flavor to the filling. My husband LOVED it. I will continue to make this often. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#Great recipe! The only thing I add is cinnamon to the filling.
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#An easy and excellent recipe! Every gathering I take this to has folks asking for the recipe and trying to guess the secret ingredient. 
Favorite Dutch Apple Pie#0#0#I was just going to look for an apple pie that used crumbs for a crust on taste of homes website, and this poped up when i opened the website, so im gona try it right now... 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#2#0#We thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I usually make the 1st attempt exactly as written but in this case, I liked the idea of cooking the bacon first and frying the chicken breasts in some of the bacon grease, reserving 2 tbs. for the onions. Outstanding!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#3#1#used lemon juice and fresh ground pepper. Also put chicken in oven with cheese, broiled for a couple minutes just to melt cheese. Sooo good!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#7#1#This is a delicious recipe. The only thing I did different was cutting up the bacon after it was cooked into small bites and then added to the onions mixture. I served homemade mashed potatoes with chicken gravy. I will be making this again.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#5#0#REALLY good! I have made this twice, the second time only loosely following the recipe (no measuring and I forgot the brown sugar) and my family all enjoyed it. This will be one of my quick fix main dishes from now on!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#5#0#Just wanted to add that i paired this with roasted asparagus and a baked potato. Delicious!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#9#4#Exact words from my husband, On its own, it is a brilliant combination of sweet and savory. He was quite happy with this meal. It needs to be pared with a vegetable and or starch that compliments rather than overshadows it. This will be a go to meal when I want to please my family. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#1#7#We did not care for the flavor of the lemon pepper, brown sugar combination. I won't make again. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#7#3#This is SO delicious. I took Jason's suggestion and cooked the bacon first, reserved some bacon grease, cooked the chicken in the bacon grease that was left in the pan, then sautéed the onion in the reserved grease. It turned out so amazingly tender and flavorful. My 7 year-old son who does not love meat asked for more!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#2#1#This is a very easy and tasty. The only change I make is I add green bell pepper to the onion mixture. We love it.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#3#0#I'll give it a 5 for flavor and 4 fir directions. Agree with Jason. Cook bacon first, and use it sauté. No need for butter.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Great recipe--Really liked Campcook's idea of cooking chicken first to lower temp and continuing in oven while proceeding with bacon and onions. Chicken much warmer for eating that way. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#1#1#I've been making this for years. We add mushrooms and use . Different cheese we like better. Very good. One of hubbys favorites 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#1#0#Easily one of my new favorites. Thanks!!!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#1#0#Made this tonight. No real changes to the recipe except for adding a fresh jalapeno pepper to the onions. Wow, excellent - great flavor. For next time, I would add two jalapeno peppers (minus the seeds) for a little kick. This was truly awesome!!! Thank you so much.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#3#2#This is an excellent dish with good flavor. I anticipated this as taking a lot of time, however, with all components being cooked in the same pan. Once I got the chicken to about 120°, I transfered the breasts to a oven safe glass baking dish to finish. That allowed me to time getting the chicken to temp and for it to rest while the bacon and then the onion/brown sugar components were completed. Timing is everything in cooking and this allowed it all to come together nicely.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#10#2#Wife and I enjoyed the dish. Good mix of sweet and savory, crispy and tender. Changes I made to the recipe include frying chicken in bacon grease prior to sauteing onions in bacon grease. Also used Beasley's Smokehouse Rub Poultry Powder, https://www.BeasleysSmokehouseRub.com/shop, to season the chicken. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#4#0#My husband and I absolutely loved this. I am not a big fan of boneless Chicken Breasts but they were on sale. What a big delicious surprise this dish was, thank you so much Brenda for sharing it!!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#1#3#Good. It is topped not smothered 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Cannot bring up recipe
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#I make this recipe all the time. I substitute bacon with turkey bacon.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#So good. My family loved it.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Very popular dish!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#4#5#What a fabulous meal! I used a smidge of Smart Balance/Amish butter instead of Canola over chicken thighs. I didn't have Lemon Pepper so squeezed fresh lemon (after rolling it to release the juices) on both sides after browning. Then crisped the thick cut bacon. This is actually easier if you use scissors and cut the bacon in 1-2 pc., cooks quicker also...In a separate cast iron pan, I carmelized 3 small onions in butter and spooned some of the bacon greases into it as needed. Fresh Sharp White Cheddar worked for me as well.I chopped Romaine/Buttercrunch lettuces and rough cut a few Craizines (cranberry raisins) w/coarse pepper, alternating the various delectable pieces with lettuce was almost like Wilted lettuce but better!Brava! I am seriously impressed. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#2#1#Me and my husband love this . Usually he is so hard to please and I want a divorce but then Ill make this and it shuts him up! mmm good
Smothered Chicken Breasts#1#0#Personally I thought the onions were too sweet, and the flavors didn't really go together. On the other hand, my husband really liked it and urged me to make it again!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#2#0#Personally I thought the onions were too sweet, and the flavors didn't really go together. On the other hand, my husband really liked it and urged me to make it again!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#The chicken was very flavorful and tasty. I really like the caramelized onions. It seemed like they really added a lot to the chicken. Being we always get the pre-cooked bacon from Schwan's, I couldn't add bacon grease. Instead I just added a little more oil. I also put the dish in the microwave to melt the cheese. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#2#0#Quick and tasty. I reversed the order and cooked the bacon first, using the drippings to cook the chicken. One note: If your lemon-pepper is salt free, the dish might need a dash of salt.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#2#0#Fabulous! This recipe is easy and delicious! Try it ...you won't be sorry! 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#2#0#There wasn't anything about this recipe that wasn't spectacular! Seriously - simple, tasty, quick! 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#1#1#Very greasy would not be making it again.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#1#0#The chicken was very moist and the combination of bacon, carmelized onions, and cheese was delicious!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#1#0#There isn't anything to change with this recipe. One of the best! Thank you Brenda for sharing. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This was so easy and delicious. It was something I would never think of to make. I think next time the only thing I may do is toss the skillet in the oven to melt the cheese more :)
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#1#My family loved this recipe even my son who hates onions! But I substituted garlic powder for the lemon pepper ( didn't like the lemon pepper!) 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Anything with bacon is delicious!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#1#Scrumptious! For the cheese I used thin slices of Gouda since that's what I had in the fridge. Very simple to prepare. I baked the chicken in the oven first instead of pan frying it because I was busy doing other things so I didn't want to be tied to the stove flipping the chicken! 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#1#My family loved it, including my husband, who is not a fan of chicken or onions. I used turkey bacon and served with rice. I added water to the brown sugar and onions to make a sauce and will double next time. Definitely a keeper!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Hi Mgooch,That 1/4 c. brown sugar is divided evenly over the four chicken breasts.Sue StetzelTaste of Home Magazine
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#How do you figure one serving of this only has 16g of sugar when 1/4 c. brown sugar has over 50g?
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Amazing flavor! My husband & I both loved it! It's a keeper! 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#My wife made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit with our family. She just didnt add the chesse because my husband can't have cheese and it was still delicious. We will make again for sure. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#1#I didn't think this would have much flavor, but I was very happy with the end results. I did pound out the chicken before cooking just to speed up the cooking time. I cut down on the sugar as other viewers suggested, but will not do it again. I think the brown sugar is what made this so good. My kids loved it! I will definitely be making this again! 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Delicious! We liked it and make variations which are all good. We modified steps so it all came out warm.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#my family loved this. will make again.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This is one of the best recipes I have ever made! Everyone enjoyed it and cleaned their plate. I will say your chicken breasts won't cook in 7 minutes on each side. I flattened mine for more even cooking but they still took 30 minutes or more. When I figured they were taking a long time, I cooked the bacon separately, otherwise dinner would have been really late. Once the chicken was done I put some bacon grease in the chicken pan and cooked the onions. I added a bit of chicken broth to the pan to deglaze and I had a bit of a really nice gravy that was totally unexpected.I also worried that cooking everything in the order that the chicken would get cold. I agree the steps should be reversed. Cook the bacon, then onions, then chicken and I suggest adding the onions back to the pan with the chicken to warm them before serving. That way, everything is hot and the cheese will melt. This will definitely be made again in our house! 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#OHHH so good!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#1#This was a delicious way to fix chicken. I cut a thick chicken breast in half vertifcally and used one slice of bacon for each half breast. I also used mozzarella cheese instead of Colby-Monterey.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#1#Delicious!! The whole family loves it. I add a little honey mustard to the caramelized onions and its a wonderful addition!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#The sweetness of the brown sugar onions with the bacon and cheese is the perfect combination! Had dinner done in 20 minutes! Perfect for the low carb lovers and the picky eaters!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Turned out amazing! I put it all under the broiler for a minute to melt the cheese before serving.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This dish has the right amount of sweetness with the brown sugar. My husband says he has never had anything like it but loves it. I will unquestionably be making this again. I did cut this recipe in half and also cut down on the bacon to only 2 slices but chopped it up.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Spectacular!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#1#0#So delicious!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#1#Made this tonite. My very picky family loved it! Very easy and so delicious. Even my daughter who always avoid onions said, Mom, you should totally make this again! Didn't change any ingredients but did crumbled the bacon. Thanks for sharing!!! 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#excellent as written. made as sandwiches
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#I have made this several times and my family loves it. I also cook the bacon first then the onions and chicken. It's really important not to overcook the onions. Easy recipe and tastes great! 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#1#0#Delicious and easy to prepare! Thanks for a great recipe.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Loved it made my own lemon pepper with fresh lemon peels, pepper and salt. Next time I make this I am going to cut bacon into small pieces and saut? it with the onions and then carmelize it. My chicken breast where kind of thick think it would work better with thinner breast.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Love this recipe! Eliminated the lemon pepper and used salt, pepper, chilli powder, and garlic powder as spices. Everything else the same. My family loved it. Will definitely make again.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#1#We used Cheddar cheese and it was amazing. Will make again soon.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Delicious!! I will definitely be making this again, maybe next time seasoning the chicken with something different than lemon pepper
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This was very tasty. I will make it again.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This is excellent, my husband wants it again. I didn't have the cheese the recipe called for so I used smoked gouda.......so good!! I will be making this again. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Quick dinner and the bacon and onions really flavor the chicken. Next time I will use a different seasoning/spice as I don't like lemon pepper seasoning and thought it took away from the flavor rather than enhancing it. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This was so easy and tasted amazing!!! Will definitely make again!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#My husband and son both agreed it was the best chicken they have ever had!!!! 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#1#This was so good! I did not use the lemon-pepper seasoning, just black pepper, and I put cheddar cheese on instead of Colby-Monterey cheese. My picky 6-year old ate the whole portion super quick.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#I thought it was just ok. Won't make again. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This was wonderful!!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#So easy and oh sooooooooooo good
Smothered Chicken Breasts#1#0#I prepared it exactly as directed, and we loved it. Thank you for a great recipe!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#I prepared this delicious chicken dish the other night and both my husband and I loved it. It is easy to prepare by following the steps. We will definitely have this again. Absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this recipe as a Volunteer Field Editor.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Good -- the onions were delicious and a big hit! Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally (if thick) or they take forever to cook!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#My husband loved it, I had a lot of fun creating something that was different from the normal weeknight meal
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Good and easy to make
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Delicious!!! Made for dinner tonight with some minor changes...had no chicken breasts so used 2 skinless thighs and legs and more onions! I may cut down the sugar or use Splenda since I am diabetic!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#1#Pretty easy and delicious! I didn't use the brown sugar, Colby jack, or lemon pepper. I used mozzarella because that's what I had and garlic seasoning mix because I don't like lemon pepper. I followed others' suggestions and did the bacon and onion first. I think it would have been better with the Colby jack so next time I'll make sure I have it and I'll crumble the bacon because the strips just slide off. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#1#1#I also made this in reverse - cooking the bacon first, then the onions, and then the chicken. I seasoned the chicken with Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of lemon pepper. After the chicken was cooked, I placed the broken up bacon pieces and onions on top. I then added the cheese and placed a lid on the skillet to allow the cheese to melt. Delicious! I have also subbed swiss cheese for the Colby Monterey Jack. Sometimes, I add sautéed mushrooms to the toppings. This is a great recipe that can be tweaked to meet the tastes of your family.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Delicious! Everyone gave this chicken recipe a thumbs up. Followed the recipe as written, except to give the cheese topped masterpiece time to melt. Great recipe!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#I made this for my mother and she loved it!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#The onions don't taste like onions and you can barely tell there is lemon pepper on it. It was Reallllllly! good. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Very tasty! Really - with bacon, cheese and sweet onions, how could it be bad???? I prepared it in reverse - starting with the bacon. I chose to dice the bacon before cooking. After removing the bacon I did the onions. Be careful not to overdo the onions or you may end up with caramel onions that stick to your teeth. (I may or may not have learned that the hard way!!) When the onions were done, I removed them to a separate bowl, wiped the skillet out and then cooked the chicken. Once the chicken was done I piled the fixings up on top and let the cheese melt a bit. We enjoyed it with mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts. Yum!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#2#I made this last night for the first time, and it was really delish. I did modify some things, however. Instead of lemon pepper rubbed chicken, I breaded the chicken in Panko because, I'm not a big fan of lemon pepper. Also, instead of bacon slices, I chopped the bacon into pieces before cooking it, and just piled it on top! The only thing I will do differently next time is put the cheese on top of the chicken, then the onions and bacon on top of the cheese so everything sticks together better. I highly recommend this dish. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#was excellent a family pleaser. great
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Made this tonight for my family and they LOVED it!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#I had at my sister's place and absolutely loved it even tough I don't like onions. They were caramilzed and yummy. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This is a great flavor combination! I loved it! My only suggestion is to cook the bacon at the same time as the chicken in another skillet. At the end I placed the chicken in the skillet I had cooked the onions in and layered the chicken in there and allowed the cheese to melt. Delicious!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This is sooo yummy! I cut the bacon and the onion into smaller pieces to make it easier to eat, but otherwise did exactly as described and was very happy with this! will certainly be making this again!!!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#I'm not a huge bacon fan but I decided to try it and I'm glad I did. This is absolutely DELISH! The onions and the bacon were so good with the chicken. I love it! 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#1#0#This was so simple and so flavorful. Everything worked well together, my husband and I both really enjoyed it.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Very good! My husband and I both loved it.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This is a very moist and flavorful chicken. I made this when we had guests over for dinner and we all loved it. It even re-heat pretty well for lunch the next day.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This is awesome! We love it. Instead of lemon pepper I used ranch seasoning. I usually cook the chicken in a seperate pan so that I can cook the onions for a longer period of time, I like them very carmelized.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#These are our favorite! I like to use thin sliced chicken breasts and I double the onions b/c they're sooooo good. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#THIS WAS SO GOOD!! The onions had the best caramelized taste ever... My fiance, my kids and I will definitely be making this on a regular base.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#1#Excellent recipe, but I'll make a couple changes next time. Wish I would have read reviews first about cutting sugar in half. My onions were fine, but on my husbands plate the onions practically turned into toffee--guess he got most of the drippings and it hardened as it cooled. I did like the sweetness though.Also, next time I would pound the breasts flat as well as add more spices like chipotle, cumin, etc, for more zing. I did make more onion that called for which was good. Will certainly make again. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This was wonderful! My son took leftovers to work, and was sharing with co-workers, who then wanted the recipe.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This is delicious and easy to make - if you use a sugar substitute blend of brown sugar, like the splenda brown sugar blend it cuts the carbs a bit and is something that can be included in a diabetic diet as well.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#My husband & I loved this recipe! I followed the advice in several of the comments and only used half of the brown sugar - the onions were awesome. Next time i may use pepper-jack cheese instead.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Wonderful!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Great brown sugar taste with the onions and my husband thinks that the bacon gives it just the right touch!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Very good, I omited the sugar and used sweeter white wine to deglaze the pan and carmalize the onions. Added some chipolte spice to the onions at the end. It was great! Thanks for sharing.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Very tasty! Would definitely make this again!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This recipe should be rated above a 5 star! It was so favorful! I did use the bacon strips that are cooked in the microwave which saved time.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Excellent! My husband is already asking to have this again. We added a splash of white wine when cooking the onions to deglaze the pan. The onions are the best part & I will probably double them next time I make it...which will be soon!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Fantastic....I also cut the Br. sugar in half, and used pepper jack cheese instead, we like a little spice. It was very easy and goooood....Thanks
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This was delicious!! I took other reviewers' advice and used about half of the brown sugar called for in the recipe to carmelize the onions and also poured off most of the bacon fat. This was really good and very easy. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#As quick and easy to make as it is delicious.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#My son found this recipe and when I tried it he loved it, my husband is a diabetic and I used the Splenda brown sugar when I made it when he was home and it tasted just as good as with the regular brown sugar
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#I splurged on calories and cooked it as stated. I'm glad I did. It was excellent and deserves the prize. Thanks so much for publishing so all can enjoy. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Too sweet with the brown sugar - omit that and cut back on the fat, please.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This is THE BEST way to eat chicken! Everything goes together so well. I never would have thought of that combination. However, there is a little too much brown sugar to sautee the onions so I will use less next time, but GREAT besides that and will make it on a regular basis!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#The softness and sweetness of the onions is in delicious contrast to the saltiness and crispness of the bacon. Fast and easy enough for a busy weeknight but good enough for company. Good job, Brenda! Thanks for sharing.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This was fantastic! I did alter some of the ingredients to suit our tastes though - I used a cajun seasoning rather than the lemon-pepper, omitted the salt and canola oil (used olive oil spray), and only used about 2 TBS of brown sugar. I also did not reserve any of the drippings, but didn't scrape the pan clean either. Between the drippings that coated the pan and the olive oil spray there was plenty left to saute the onion. Will become a regular on our table! 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This was just terrific. All the best flavors. This will become a regular on our dinner table from here on.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This was soooo good and quick! My mouth waters just thinking about it.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#1#0#Just made this for dinner and it was fantastic. I made it in 30 minutes flat by cutting the chicken breasts thin and cooking the bacon in the microwave. Served it over rice with a side of green beans and pillsbury biscuits...tasted great and looked good too.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#This was very good but a little on the sweet side. Next time, I'll cut the sugar by at least half, and possibly add some pepper flakes or use pepper jack cheese to heat it up a little. We grilled the chicken and added the toppings afterwards. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#We love this recepie! I've changed up the lemon-pepper with a cayenne based seasoning we love, and I don't do onions because I don't care for them. To cut time, I use ready-to-eat bacon that I heat up in the microwave. This is great with a veggie blend and rice! It's one of our favorites! 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#I made this recipe last night and my family LOVED it. My youngest son said this one is a keeper. Very easy to make. My husband loved the onions (I didn't make enough). Can't wait to make it again. Thanks BrendaVikki1413 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#I had my father over for dinner and prepared this meal...it is one of his favorites now. Since it was such a big hit with my Dad, I decided to bring some to my Grandma (who is very critical of food) and she loved it too. She said it reminded her of something she'd order at Outback Steakhouse. I'll be making this meal again for sure! 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#My husband doesnt like lemon pepper so I used garlic pepper instead. I also added sated mushrooms and it was delicious.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#Re: Smothered Chicken BreastsThis is a great recipe. I don't usually flatten the chicken breasts. It takes me about 45 minutes to prepare. I usually use about half of the bacon. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#The flattened chicken was great! It took 45 minutes for my onions to carmelize, so the 30 minute total is rather misleading. I left the cheese out and it was fabulous!
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#I like the idea of the flattened chicken! I also modified the recipe by cubing the chicken and breaking the bacon into bite size pieces. This makes it easier for younger children to enjoy too.
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#These are awesome. I flatten the chicken til it's quite thin so it's more tender. 
Smothered Chicken Breasts#0#0#FANTASTIC!!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This is the best sweet bread I have ever made!! It keeps well in the freezer and stays so nice and moist. I left out the nuts because I didn't want anything to detract from the lemon and blueberry flavors.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#4#4#Can I use lemon curd in this recipe?
Lemon Blueberry Bread#9#2#Can this be made into muffins?
Lemon Blueberry Bread#5#0#This is extremely delicious and amazing with a cup of coffee. I shared the recipe with my sister, she also bakes frequently.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#17#5#Omg.!! We do alot of baking and this is easily the most delicious bread we've ever eaten.!!?????My son and I wanted to eat it in one sitting.! We didn't even make the glaze for it and it was still super delicious. Does not need the glaze. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#5#8#Is the sugar used in the bread granulated sugar or powder sugar? I wish it was specified!!! And what for the glaze? I would assume powder / icing sugar for glaze? 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#12#1#For the glaze, is it granulated sugar or powdered?
Lemon Blueberry Bread#8#1#I've made this bread for a few years now, and never can seem to keep it around, as for getting 16 servings, we're lucky to get 10. I usually end up making a second loaf, and also make it, and give it as gifts. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#5#1#Made this bread the other day and we loved it. It's not overly sweet and is great as a breakfast bread, although it can double as a dessert too. I used frozen blueberries and omitted the nuts ~ just a personal preference. Will make this again! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#6#3#So glad I tried this recipe!! Delicious!! Perfectly moist and just the right amount of sweetness and blueberries! Looks beautiful sliced on a platter. Thank You for sharing this wonderful recipe!! Should have made 2 loaves! (Did not think it needed the nuts so did not add)
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#0#Easy, fast and delicious. I made it for the first time last week and my husband has already asked me to make it again...within a few days....
Lemon Blueberry Bread#3#0#Just made this again. The first time was wonderful and since I have a cup of blue berries left over what could be more perfect than making it again. Absolutely love it and so does my husband who is not a blueberry fan.,
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Love this!! Easy to prepare and always welcomed as a dessert.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#2#0#I just made this bread and I love it. In my dad's words Delicious, wow! I'm going to my in-laws in Michigan and I'm making the bread before I go to take with me. I will try some of Blake's suggestions and toast the nuts the next time I make the bread. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#2#0#This is wonderful!! Easy to prepare and always appreciated!!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#9#1#This is my go-to recipe for quick breads. Super tasty, glaze is great as it soaks in while the bread is warm and give is a flavor burst. Make two and freeze one, you will be glad you did
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#0#This is so delicious! Total winner! Easy to make too!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#4#1#This bread was excellent. The glaze is the star of the show for this recipe. We used fresh blueberries, which made a big difference too. I've also made into muffins and they were all well received. This is a keeper! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#18#8#Absolutely delicious! I added a cup of raisins and went generous on the blueberries. Also I divided my sugar into half raw/brown and half white/granulated for extra flavour. Made my own glaze by combining 2 tablespoons melted butter, 1/2 cup confectioners sugar, teaspoon vanilla essence and 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice. Made the bread extremely moist and tangy! Loved this and enjoyed cooking it too. If I remembered I would have added some vanilla essence into the bread mix too! But works fine without it too.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#2#0#Family loved this, wonderful taste. Great bread.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#2#0#Really yummy! Mine did take a lot longer to bake - maybe because I used the convection option on my oven. But the bread turned out great!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#5#1#Yummy! Lemon and blueberry are a match made in Heaven loved this quick and easy to make bread!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#3#0#My family loved it!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#0#Excellent flavor! I had to bake 10 minutes extra.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#0#Made to enjoy on Thanksgiving morning while watching the parade. No changes to recipe - it was great as is. Will make this a Tradition for when we are able to share our Thanksgiving again with family.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#5#1#I used frozen huckleberries in mine & omitted the nuts. It baked up very moist and tender. Thank you for the recipe!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#3#0#This bread was very moist. The flavors developed more as it sat, so we enjoyed it more the next day. I followed the recipe exactly.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#4#0#I have tried a couple blueberry lemon loaf recipes but this is the one I've returned to! I find it to be more cake/dessert like or a yummy snack. I use frozen blueberries and it works perfect. I mixed icing sugar with lemon juice to make the glaze and it keeps the loaf moist and adds an extra punch of lemon. Definitely my go-to Blueberry Lemon Loaf!! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#2#0#Followed recipe exactly. Yummy and a fan favorite.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#3#0#Loved it! Used gluten free flour instead of regular Flour. Otherwise flowed recipe and it came out great!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#9#9#Can I freeze this bread?
Lemon Blueberry Bread#2#0#This is absolutely the best lemon blueberry bread in the world. Followed recipe as is but left out nuts. Didn't need glaze. Yummly!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#2#0#Didn't have baking powder so I substituted with a mix of vinegar and baking soda. Used frozen blueberries. The quick bread turns a beautiful golden color for 60 minute cook time in my gas oven. I admit I didn't use a glaze and it was still superb! Will be making this one again! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#5#1#I thought this was a delicious recipe. I used frozen blueberries, full cream milk and a pecan walnut blend. It was superb. Cooked a a toy an hour and was crunchy in the outside, light and fluffy inside. Not sure why some people are saying it's dense and heavy, maybe not enough baking powder? I wouldn't change a thing although I'm keen to try it with variations. Orange, raspberry and macadamia anyone? Thank you.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#4#0#I am new to baking and my bread turned out perfect. Everyone enjoyed it! Thank you.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#12#1#This recipe was excellent thank you ! For the ones that mention the butter for the glaze obviously didnt read the recipe properly ! It says glaze ingredient :sugar and lemon juice! If you going to complaint when a chef kindly share their work then maybe you need to remove yourself from their following !
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#1#I made this yesterday and it tasted ok but was denser than I thought it should be. I did use frozen blueberries so that made of made a difference. Not a repeat at our house.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#0#When I pull up the recipe, the glaze ingredients list lemon juice only. Am I missing something?
Lemon Blueberry Bread#4#0#Easy to make and delicious, used fresh blueberries and chopped pecans. Will definitely make again, thank you!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#3#0#I won a best in bread ribbon for this Quick bread at our local county fair. Made this exactly as written
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#0#Can this be frozen?
Lemon Blueberry Bread#2#12#I really enjoyed this. I used half of the sugar, twice the blueberries, and added some sour cream since I only had skim milk on hand. It was great without the added glaze (I'm not a fan of having more sugar than fruit in a recipe; it should be called a Sugar Blueberry Bread based on the proportions in the recipe!). 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#0#Excellent and easy to make, we made it with fresh picked Blueberries but next time I would leave out the nuts, this bread did not last long we loved it and will make it again.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#2#0#This is the easiest bread to make. Always have all ingredients on hand. I do not add the nuts. The butter is in the bread part NOT in the glaze. I can not understand how some people thought the butter was in the glaze. And, I agree, I have to cook about 10 minutes longer. Could be my oven. This never disappoints and could certainly be changed up using other berries and juice.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I love this bread, have made it several times. I would probably categorize it more cake than bread, however. I would like to make it in mini loaves to share but don't know how to adjust the baking time. Any suggestions? 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This is my go to sweet bread recipe. I change it up with frozen mixed berries and lime, bake in 4 mini loaf pans but keep everything else the same. Great recipe!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#1#I've made this bread a few times and it never disappoints. Found some more blueberries in the frezzer this morning and since my state still has a stay at home issued because of covid 19 I figured I'll add this to my listed of stuff since I've been home since March 20th. I've baked something at least once aweek since March 20th. I highly recommend this recipe. I do have to leave it in the oven about 10 mins longer than in the directions, but I know over temps vary.. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#0#Great recipe, just wasn't quite sweet enough for my taste. Going to soak the blueberries in a little sugar for a few hours next time. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#0#Bread recipe was perfect, it's delicious. However, the glaze was...eh...too watery? I ended up doing it the old fashioned way with a cup of powdered sugar, an 18th of a cup of milk and a tablespoon or two of lemon juice. Was much better and looked nicer, in my opinion. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#1#Help! I made this twice and it did not cook on the bottom, bought new baking powder used 2% milk. Could it be my oven, although I haven't had any problems until this...thank you. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#2#I am rating this as a three because I was trying different lemon blueberry recipes and this one just doesn't deserve the 5 stars. My family did enjoy the bread. It was the first recipe I tried out. Someone else mentioned this comment and I fully agree after making a different recipe. The bread is actually too heavy. Nice flavor but sits heavy and feels heavy. The biggest difference between this recipe and another I tried was how many eggs. The other recipe I really liked took 3 eggs. I may have said I would make this again but not anymore. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#We love it! I was able to home grown blueberries and lemons. Ate in 1 day!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#0#Thanks Juianne! This is delicious! I couldn't find the lemon juice I had purchased for this bread so I used a lime from my tree along with frozen blueberries. It's a very forgiving recipe. A keeper for sure! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#0#Made this exactly as written and it was delish! There is butter in the recipe given. Don't know what the confusion is about that, and there isn't supposed to be butter in the topping. It is a glaze not frosting. Easy to make, quick, and perfect.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#My husband could not stop raving about this bread and he is not easy to please.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#1#This was not a big hit with my family. I think it tries to be three different breads and doesn't succeed with any of them. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#2#1#So beautiful, delicious, and easy to make!! Mine turned out very brown and crisp on the outside by the time the inside was cooked (fluffy and moist) and I was wondering if anyone had any tips to prevent the outside from becoming more crust like than cake like?
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#0#Made this for the first time had to make a few changes did not have blueberries or nuts made with lemon, raspberry and chocolate chips, turned out great. Everyone loved it!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#1#Absolutely delicious!! Make sure to use fresh lemons and don't skimp on the zest! I used confectioners sugar instead of granulated (I make a lemon cookie with the same glaze and love it, so that's why I substituted). My husband was planning to take part of this to work to share with his coworkers and he loved it so much he changed his mind so he could eat it all himself! Perfect with coffee or tea!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This bread is delicious and easy to make! Would definitely make again...and again. I used whole milk and omitted nuts (didn't have any on hand).
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#It's in the oven now. Smells wonderful. But I'm having trouble reconciling the recipe and the comments. The butter is listed as part of the bread. Is that correct ? 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I made this bread yesterday. The bread is really, really good. My husband loved it! Everything is OK in the recipe, except that the butter is part of the ingredients for the bread and not for glaze. I know it's only a mistake, but maybe this information can be help to others.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#3#The butter is listed as a glaze ingredient.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#6#One star because the directions say to use butter. Butter is not in the ingredients list, except for the glaze. The directions are incomplete.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I made this, this afternoon, for the first time. The taste is delicious, but the bread looked pale on top (gas oven on convection at 350 for 50 mins). The recipe called for 60 a 70 mins, but it was done In 55 mins. My pan was 1/2 inch longer, and 1/2 inch wider than the 8x4 recommended. I did glaze it. I'll have to find a better, and 8x4 pan to make again. Also, I thought walnuts or pecans would be too strong, so I added pistachios. They worked great!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I've made this several times. Use fresh blueberries! I also make 3 mini loaves out of this vs the 1 big loaf. Turns out great. I use 350 degrees and cut bake time down to 40-45 mins depending. Awesome recipe. It's a hit!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This was VERY good! Doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves. Added about 1/2 tsp lemon extract and used chopped pecans for the nuts. I felt the nuts seemed out of place, but everyone else seemed to not mind. Since this was my first time making blueberry anything, I followed other's suggestions and dusted my blueberries with flour before adding to the mixture. I bake often for my husband's work and this was definitely the favorite! Will make again! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Four stars for taste. One star deducted for the instruction to use an 8x4 pan. It was too small and batter bubbled over it. Also, the top browned quickly but that was mitigated by putting a piece of foil over top. Unfortunately the bread was still gooey underneath even after 70 minutes so I scooped it into plates and microwaved it to firm it up. My hubby isn't a big sweets eater but he really, really liked this. I left out the nuts because I don't like nuts in baked goods. Next time I make this I will only use a 9x5 pan and hope for better results.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Love this recipe! Had to make some adjustments (no nuts) but it turned out fantastic!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Oh my!! This bread is awesome!! I added some lemon extract to it!! It is so moist and delicious!! I WILL be making this again!!!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#What kind of bread pan are you using glass or metal? I used glass and didn't adjust anything and it got too dark on the outside before it fully cooked. Had a good taste minus the dark outside.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This was excellent. Will make again and again.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#1#This is A Great recipe!! I made it today, fresh blueberries, fresh lemons and zest and walnuts! Delish!! Thank you for this recipe, my 1st time to make a blueberry bread. Definitely will make again. (Sugar for the icing.....confectioners, butter softened, not melted and add a little flour to the blueberries 1st before folding into the batter.)
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Absolutely delicious! Made 2 loaves, froze one. Used freshly picked blueberries. Did not have any 2% milk so I used 1/3 c fat free milk and 2/3 low fat half and half (doubled recipe). Worked fine!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This is so delicious! It's a perfect blend of sweet and tart! It was so easy to make and it was very light and moist. I did rolI the blueberries in flour and used 10-X sugar for the glaze. I served it with a scoop of lemon sherbet . What a great summer dessert!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This lemon blueberry bread was very good. The best way Mom and I can describe the taste is like blueberry fruitcake (lol, without all the candied fruit). It has a moist dense texture. I used granulated sugar in the glaze (I see some reviewers used confectioners sugar). The sweetness was perfect. Use fresh lemons for best results.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I love this bread! If you don't want your blueberries to sink, freeze them first as I do. I use 3 mini pans and bake for 40 minutes. I haven't tried the glaze yet because, for me, it's just right as is.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Looking forward to baking this, sounds delicious. Thx for helpful tips!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#1#Have been making this for several years without the nuts. We prefer nuts in banana bread or a pumpkin, etc. To answer a reviewer; the glaze is granulated sugar. I use this almost always with sweet breads. Depending on what type of bread, I substitute orange juice for lemon juice. That is a great pairing with banana or any spice bread. If you put the glaze on as soon as it comes out of the oven, it sets to a somewhat crunchy sugar topping...delicious!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#0#I can't jump for joy for this bread. Taste is excellent. I live at sea level. I've made this twice. Mine does not rise as well as the photo. Not a fluffy/grainy bread. I think the suggested oven temp is too hot. I used frozen blueberries both times. I recommend half-cup of berries. Also, fresh blueberries would probably bleed less. I did toss the berries in a tablespoon of flour. Old folks idea to keep berries from sinking. BUT The glaze is totally wrong. Use confectioners sugar. This version is a useless syrup. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I've made this numerous times and it always turns out moist with just the right mix of tart and sweet. Since it doesn't specify powdered sugar, I use granulated which gives it a clear glaze rather than something more like a frosting. Yummy!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This was delicious. I assumed the 1/4 cup of sugar for the glaze was powdered sugar. Has anyone used granulated sugar for the glaze? Not sure which is correct.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I have made this several times and am about to make it again. It is a wonderful, tangy, moist bread. The glaze just enhances it. It is a regular at our Easter brunch and requested each year!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#It's perfect. I've made this quite a few times, one as a side to brunch- lunch and the other as a decadent dessert when I add a vanilla lemon buttercream icing. It's wonderful. I add a 1/4 ts of almond extract and I suspend the blueberries in flour before adding them to the batter.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I have made this many many times over the years
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This is delicious! I will make it, again and again, ad infinitum lol
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Heavenly! Plenty of lemon flavor! I did not have zest so I increased lemon juice by 3 TBSP and decreased milk by the same amount. It definitely needs the longer cooking time so don't rush it! My husband said it was a perfect balance of lemon and sweet. (Thanks to fhquilting for tip about lining the bottom with waxed paper. It made taking it out of the pan a breeze.)
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#1#This was good. However my blueberries did so k to the bottom. I googled my problem and apparantly if u toss the fruit in the flower mixture before adding this will prevent them from sinking. It was a little sweet with the icing so next time I will have to try a confectioner sugar glaze.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This is very good quick bread. My daughter-in-law raises her own blueberries, so I always get some when they are ripe to make this special bread.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Delicious! Very moist with a similar texture to pound cake.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#So moist and so good!!! Do to my son's severe milk allergies, I used Earth Balance in place of the butter and Rice milk. I also used 3 mini loaf pans and baked for 45 minutes. I did not make the glaze. It did not need any, it was so good without it. It was gone within the first couple of hours. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Made this today.I could hardly wait for it to cool.Made with white whole wheat flour.Tasted great.Imake all my breakfast breads.this one will be a regular.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#2#0#So good! To eliminate the bread not releasing from the pan do this: Cut waxed paper to fit the bottom of the pan after you spray the pan bottom to hold the wax paper tightly. Spray the paper after it is in the pan. After baking, run a knife around the sides to release the bread. Turn the pan upside down and the bread will slide out.Peal off the wax paper. Do not spray the sides of the pan to allow the batter to rise and form a nice loaf. I do this for all of my dessert breads. I double this recipe and pour it into 3 - 8 x 4 pans and freeze 2 of the loaves. If making a single recipe I use a 9 x 5 pan. If doubling, I cut the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and I don't add nuts at all. I brush the glaze over the sides and then drizzle the rest of the glaze over the top. Wonderful recipe! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#SUPER delicious. Will be making it again. Did not use nuts and it was still yummy. Super moist and full of flavor!Wondering if I can use blackberries with this recipe. Anyone tried iother fruits?
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Easy and yummy!!!!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#The best! Now one of my go-to recipes.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I am not a baker - this was wonderfully easy. So delicious. Keep these kind coming.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#0#Perfectly delicious! My family loves it. It is pretty, as well as tasty. I am making it again (third time this season) but leaving out the nuts, as I am making a different kind of bread that really needs nuts and I want people to have a nut-free option.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This totally fell apart when I tried to take it out of the pan after 15 min. of cooling. I had greased the pan, and it did come out, but it came out a total mess. I followed the directions to the letter.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Absolutely delicious!!!!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I have made this bread a few times and it is a definite favorite! I even like to sprinkle some coarse sugar on top of the glaze for a little crunch. Has anyone tried to freeze the loaf and can tell me if it keeps? I freeze pumpkin and other breads all the time, but I was wondering how this one would hold up.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I just made this today exactly as directed. It turned out perfect and is absolutely delicious. It really filled that 8x4 pan and I was worried it would spill over but it didn't. I set the timer for 50 minutes and it wasn't quite done so I left it in for close to 10 minutes longer. This is a keeper. I read after it was in the oven about coating the blueberries with flour but luckily didn't have problems with then sinking to the bottom. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#0#I make this during summer blueberry season, with fresh berries and fresh lemon juice. It's a huge hit everywhere, and lots of people have asked for the recipe. The glaze makes it really awesome. Hint - gently shake blueberries with 1 T. of flour from the recipe, to keep them from sinking. I use a slightly larger loaf pan than what is called for. Definitely a keeper! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I am making this for the second time today. It is very flavorful and moist. I am going to try a powdered sugar and lemon glaze this time on a cooled loaf just to experiment.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#1#DO NOT BAKE THIS IN AN 8x4 PAN AS DIRECTED. MY BREAD HAS BEEN IN THE OVEN 1 HOUR AND 25 MINUTES AND IT'S STILL GOO IN THE MIDDLE. I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE BATTER WAS DELICIOUS AND I'VE USED 3 LEMONS AND A 6 OUNCE CONTAINER OF BLUEBERRIES. WHAT A WASTE. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This is easy and tastes soooooooooooo delicious! I will file this under Best 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I love this bread, so moist and flavorful! Next time I will try baking in two small loaves rather than one big loaf.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Great recipe! Everyone who i make this for loves it. I used the throwaway aluminum container and it worked perfectly fine. i found it needed to cook a bit longer (but my oven is a bit off). Couple of tips- when the top was getting a bit brown, i put a piece of aluminum foil on top, and it ruined the beautiful top when i took it off, so i decided to just lower the temp a bit and it seemed to do the trick. next time i wont put any foil on top. also flour the blueberries before mixing in so they dont fall to the bottom :)
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Yes, butter and flour a glass bread pan. 50 minutes baking seems pretty fine, in my oven (test with toothpick). Then 10 minutes rest time in the pan on a wire rack. Finally, cut out of the pan and cool on the rack. The bread is super, and glaze is not needed, but would probably be excellent, too!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Excellent!! Made bread and glaze according to recipe. First time I made it in metal loaf pan and evidently did not grease pan adequately-lost the entire top of bread. Now I use a Pyrex loaf pan and spray bottom and sides. Also need to wait t least 10 minutes before inverting., It is easy and delicious! I Before serving-I warm it a few seconds in the microwave and put a little butter mixed with a good quality blueberry jam on it----really good!!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Added a few extra blueberries, it was delicious!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This bread is outstanding! I've made it numerous times since the recipe was first published in 1995 and it always brings plenty of compliments. It's definitely a family favorite! As a volunteer Field Editor for TOH, I highly recommend it. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I made this bread for a church function and it went together so fast that I decided to make another one for my family. It is so good. I'm not even a big fan of lemon and I loved it. With the fresh lemon peel and juice it is such a great quick bread. Will be making this again. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I made the blueberry bread into Blueberry Muffins. I didn't made the glaze for the top. I did add more berries then the recipe call for. They were delicious, my husband took them to work and passed them out to co-workers. Several people ask for the recipe. This will be my go to recipe for Blueberry Muffins. Thanks, Taste of Home cooks. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Can't say I followed the recipe to a T as I had half a lime and didn't know what to do with it. I followed the recipe as written but used lemon-lime juice and peel. This is a wonderful recipe and will definitely make again! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Delicious
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Fabulous! Turns out perfectly every time.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Great use of bananas & blueberries. Yummy!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#1#0#Fabulous bread. I was out of milk so used 1/2 c nonfat plain Greek yogurt 1/2 t baking soda. Also I didn't use the lemon rind, but with the lemon glaze it was VERY (deliciously) lemony. I did heat the glaze until the sugar dissolved. Only baked it for 35 minutes (but split the recipe into 2 smaller pans).This was the best sweet bread I have ever tasted! Was so light - we ate two loaves in one afternoon (Mom and 3 kids!). Will definitely make it again. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This bread turned out really yummy. Took advise of other reviewers and cut cooking time to 50 minutes. Also covered the loaf pan with aluminum foil during the last ten minutes to ensure the top didn't brown too much. Unlike one other reviewer I thought the lemon flavor really came through. I did increase the blueberries to 1 1/2 cup and cut the sugar to 2/3 cup. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#i did everything the recipe said except i only had to bake it 50 minutes. the top came out hard..not crusty but hard and chewy. i couldnt taste any of the lemon flavoring. next time i will add alittle more lemon juice...if i make it at all. i was very disappointed
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Loved this cake! Very lemony and moist. Used frozen blueberries from our patch and followed recipe exactly. I agree with one of the other reviewers to start checking for doneness after about 45 minutes. Thanks for another great recipe!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This is the absolute best blueberry bread! The lemon juice and zest very nicely complements the blueberries. Regardless of the size of your loaf pan, I suggest setting the timer to 45 minutes then checking thereafter, as 60 minutes is too long as a starting point.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Very good. I used only 3/4 cup of sugar in the bread and used powered sugar for the glaze.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Really yummy and easy. A nice change from banana bread. Didn't change a thing. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I substitute sliced cranberries instead of blueberries in the fall!!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I recall making this bread and if I remember correctly, I'd used 5 miniature loaf pans.I greased and floured the loaf pans used. If using other pans, I suggest one to two 7-1/2x3-1/2 loaf pans, greased and floured! I'd used the peel of 1 large lemon, 1-1/2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries with 1/8 cup all-purpose flour mixed in with the berries to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the loaves! I'd used 1/4 cup lemon juice and1/4 cup sugar and I cooled the bread at least 20 minutes so that bread had a chance to settle! I glazed the loaves as soon as they came out of oven. I'd probably bake the miniature loaves 40 to 45 minutes and the 7 loaves at least 45 to 50 minutes. I used my cake tester to test the loaves and made sure that the cake tester came out clean! This recipe is a good one! Thank you for sharing this recipe! delowenstein 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Absolutely the best blueberry bread I have ever eaten. It was out of the oven and we ate it up so fast, I just made a 2nd loaf. :)PS: To the person who commented that her blueberries fall to the bottom of the pan, I used frozen blueberries in my recipe (did not need to thaw them out) and the blueberries stayed put and did not sink to the bottom.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Delicious. Added 1 tbs. vanilla, it was amazing!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Made these today. Very moist and delicious!!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This was a fantastic recipe. Followed directions exactly and bread disappeared quickly. To the reviewer who said their blueberries fell to bottom of the pan. The solution is to reserve 1 Tablespoon of your flour and put in sandwich bag then add your completely dry blueberries and coat them. This prevents them from falling to the bottom of your pan.This is a bread you could take anywhere and be proud. Thank you to the person who took the time to post/share with me.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Flavor was very good but the blueberries sunk to the bottom. Not really happy with that.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#The very best lemon blueberry bread I have ever made. Made it for the 4th of July, everyone loved it. Making it again today. I triple it each time and it turns out great.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Fragrant and moist - I've made this bread several times now and it is consistently delicious! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#OMG I love this recipe!! Everyone who tried it loved it too. I will make this again.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I love this bread and so do my children
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#wanderful blueberry bread made this today
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Wonderful recipe. Was perfect to mix up quick with a cup of leftover blueberries. I left out the nuts and added a teaspoon of the lemon zest to the glaze. Yum!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Wow!! Fantastic recipe! Baked a loaf last evening (without the nuts) for a carry-in at work today and it rapidly disappeared plus received several requests for the recipe. This is definitely a recipe I'll make many more times.Although the glaze is fantastic, I'll probably omit it unless I'm going to serve this bread as a dessert, just to save a few calories. I took another reviewer's advice and greased and floured the pan plus I lined the bottom of the pan with waxed paper to make removal a snap. I would recommend this additional step to all. It's so frustrating when your loaf won't come out of the pan in one piece. Amazing recipe!!! You won't be disappointed. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Really delicious! Followed the recipe except used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup flour. Love the lemon glaze - it's so simple and really adds a nice touch! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I have made this twice now (omitting nuts due to allergies) and my husband says it is one of the best baked goods he has ever had. He loved it. I made it once in a loaf pan. The second time I doubled the recipe and made it in a bundt for a dinner party. It was devoured and I was begged for the recipe. This is going to be made for many years to come!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#The best Blueberry Bread EVER!!! My family loves it, and I will definitely be making this scrumptious bread again.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This recipe is amazingly refreshing and highly recommended! The smell and taste is great for the whole family! Yummy
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I've made this several times now and it's gone before it has time to cool. I use extra lemon in both the bread and the glaze to give it a yummy tart flavor. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I substituted orange juice and orange zest since I am not a lemon person and it was wonderful, will definitely make again!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#THIS IS A FIVE STAR PERSONAL FAVORITE!! I never make the glaze. It's plenty sweet without!! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Rave reviews from church members!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I've been making this one since the early 90's! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I rate this 5 stars! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#My 2nd time making this.Only thing I did different was reduce the sugar to a heaping 3/4 cup and 1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice (instead of 3). Was way too lemony for my taste buds the 1st try as written. Also, if you're allergic to nuts you can substitute with poppy seeds or leave it out altogether. Great find! This recipe is a keeper. Thanks! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Wonderful pound cake like texture Great flavor .Tweaked a bit used oil instead of butter(prefer a finer crumb + health/calorie benefits).Also used pulp from lemons as well to pump up flavor.no nuts in pantry.thank you for a great recipe.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This is one of those'perfect' recipes - - exactly as it is written. Made my first loaf yesterday and my second one a few minutes ago - - to share (maybe!). 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This bread is excellent. I used fresh lemon juice and fresh blueberries that we pick and freeze to use all year long. A little less sugar gave it a more lemony taste which is great with the blueberries. We loved it without the glaze. Gooood stuff !!!! Wildflower
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#absolutely delicious just the way it is, wouldn't change a thing, definitely a familty fave! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This is a great recipe. I changed it up a bit. I used self rising flour instead of regular and ommited the baking powder. I only used a pinch of salt also. And instead of the milk I used sour cream. I like the tangy taste it gives and a richer texture. My husband was really digging this recipe. He isnt a big sweet eater. This last time I made it I baked it in a spring form pan so it was more of a coffee cake!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Great lemony taste. I added 4oz of applesauce.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Incredible! Fairly easy to make. Make sure and flour the pan otherwise the bread will not come out of the pan.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Awesome! I've been looking for lots of recipes with lemons in them, and stumbled upon this one yesterday after I received an abundance of fresh lemons and grapefruits from someone in Arizona. I decided to make this and it turned out really nice and looked so pretty -- just make sure you grease/flour your pan well! Some of the bottom got stuck, but I was able to piece it back together. My boyfriend really liked this bread and said This loaf will get eaten in no time! It has a nice heavy pound cake consistency, and the glaze on top tastes great. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#this bread is awesome & my kids love the lemon glaze on top! We pick and freeze blueberries just so we can have this all winter long!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This is my all time favorite lemon bread recipe! It's something I make quite a bit in the Summer. Excellent! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Excellent and easy recipe. I did leave out the nuts because I didn't have any on hand; no one missed them. My fiance said that it was very moist and this recipe is definately a keeper. That's a big compliment coming from him. Thanks for sharing the great recipe! 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This is an excellent recipe. Very moist and tasty: definitely a keeper!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#1#I wasn't a fan of anything containing cooked blueberries until I tried this. It has long been a favorite recipe of mine. 
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Excellent recipe! So much flavor and very moist, almost a dessert instead of a bread.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#I used fresh berries for this Lemon Bread. Oh My it was gone in a flash! Loved by all. I recommend this recipe and it was easy to prepare.
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#This bread was delicious. I doubled it to make for a brunch....everyone loved it and wanted the recipe! YUMMY!!!
Lemon Blueberry Bread#0#0#Delicious, and a quick easy recipe. Made recipe exact, just had to sub 3 teaspoons of lemon extract for the lemon zest as I didn't have any lemons on hand. Also didn't make the glaze, personal preference.A definite keeper. Thanks Julianne
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#2#3#I used a combination of ground beef and Italian sausage, omitted the salt, doubled the oregano, and used regular lasagna noodles. The filling tasted good, but the noodles turned out with a weird, hard-to-describe consistency - like chewy cheese or mushy noodles. In the future, I think I'll just make it in the oven. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#3#0#This was good. I used a 24 oz can of pasta sauce and then added 5 oz of tomato sauce instead of the 29 oz tomato sauce. I also used ricotta cheese in place of the cottage cheese, as we prefer ricotta. I served it with French bread and a tossed green salad.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#1#0#Great! Will add It. sausage next time
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Love this recipe! Makes great leftovers too.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#1#1#Cooked this last night, subbing 29 oz. canned tomatoes for sauce. The lasagna was so delicious. I was surprised at the good taste and the ease of this dish.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#What size crockpot do you recommend for this recipe?
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#made as reciept said next time will use crushed tomatoes instead gives better flavor
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Made this today and used jarred spaghetti sauce, ricotta, and the cottage cheese. It turned out quite tasty, although not the perfect squares that lasagna in a pan gives you. Much quicker to put together. I did rim the slow cooker with aluminum foil to keep the edges from drying out as others suggested and it worked out fine.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#1#I took this in for a work luncheon and everyone really enjoyed it. I did use half ricotta and half cottage cheese for the cheese blend. I always make that combo when making lasagna. It's something my mom always did growing up and I feel makes a big different with the flavor
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#always a hit. I like to make a double batch and use half ricotta and half cottage cheese. My husband like me to add ground italian sausage in.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#1#10#Lasagna made with cottage cheese?? Disgusting............. Lasagna is made with Ricotta cheese..........
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#So good!!!!! Love that this can be cooked in the crock-pot. Add a salad and some garlic bread and supper is ready!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#1#1#I have been making this for years. It is always a hit. I make it for pot luck dinners too and I never have left overs!!! I use regular Lasagna noodles though instead of the no cook lasagna and it turns out great. It's so easy and frees up my day to get other things done. Everyone things I work for hours over making it. The left overs freeze great. I was pleasantly surprises at that. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Excellent recipe and easy to put together. Like others, I used Italian sausage instead of beef (taste preference), otherwise made as is. Thank you!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This is delicious! Love using the slow cooker in the fall and winter. Just be careful not to overlook, some of my noodles got a bit crispy around the edges!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This was great! So nice to have it ready when we got home on a busy day! We added extra sauce on top because we'd like it that way! 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Very quick and easy. We actually had to eat this the day after due to a change in our plans and it was still very good.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#After I started making this, I began to wonder why all the work just to put it in a crock pot. It did taste okay, but I think I will stick with making lasagna and then baking it in the oven.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I like the simplicity of this recipe. However, I am a very busy Mom, so I did not make my own sauce. Rather, I used Mid's brand pasta sauce with meat and mushrooms. I then added about half a cup of water around the sides of the crock-pot. It turned out absolutely perfect and delicious! We are a family of six, and the portion size of this recipe was great also! 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#1#This is now my all time favorite as well as my families favorite. They said the would rather have this one than the one I had done for years.It is great and simple and it doesn't take as much time to fix as it did my oven recipe. The only change I made was I left out tomato paste and replaced with one 14.5 ounce can of Hunts no salt diced tomatoes with Basil,Garlic & Oregano. This will be my forever Lasagna. A big shout out too Lisa Micheletti from Collierville, Tennessee. I am also from Tennessee. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This is the best slow cooker lasagna that I have tried. I have a trick that I learned. Make a ring of foil wrap around the edges of the cooker before preparing lasagna. Only the sides, not the bottom. This way there are no noodle and cheese burnt spots on the edges. It works awesome. It also makes clean-up a breeze!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Perfect make ahead recipe! Delicious just as written but easy to adapt for any family to make their favorite.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#1#0#This was my first time making homemade Lasagna. I t was so easy and fun! I also used a crock pot liner which made clean up a breeze.to boost the flavor I used hot ground sausage mixed with 1 packet of dry French onion soup mix and added I egg to the cheese mixture which made it easy to spread,I also used the regular lasagna noodles and turned out great, flavorful!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I love using my slow cooker, and this was a hit!! A keeper!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This is amazingly good. Easy to make just put it together and forget it type recipe. Loved it!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This was great. Next time I will add Italian sausage for a bit more flavor. But this is a keeper.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#1#0#Very good Lasagna. I was surprised it was done in that short amount of time, but it was. I used spaghetti sauce as suggested by other reviews and used a slow cooker liner which made it easy to remove and made cleanup a breeze. Not sure what I'm going to with all the leftovers as it's just my husband and me. I'll let it cool overnight and split it up in another 3 portions. Three more meals headed for the freezer. Thank you Lisa for the recipe. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#1#This was so dang good, but have to say we changed it up a bit b/c we thought it might be a bit bland for us. Added 3/4 lb hot Italian sausage, 5 mushrooms, replaced the water w/ low sodium beef broth, used tomato paste w/ basil, garlic & oregano, added 1+ tsp each dried oregano, basil & Italian seasoning, 1/8 tsp each red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper, and added 1 c Italian shredded 5 cheeses. Next time will use a crock liner to make removing it easier. Really great the next day too, lots of flavor!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I didn't put as much mozz. cheese in it, but my husband (the bottomless pit) ate a bowl of it and was full! Delicious! 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#When they go for seconds and thirds you know you've got a winner in my house!! 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Tremendous! Inexpensive, easy, and quick! If you follow the directions, it turns out perfect. It doesn't need any tweaking in my opinion 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This is really a tasty and easy lasagna recipe
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This turned out awesome! All my oven lasagnas turn out runny. This was firm and held it's layers like it should. The flavor was great!*I forgot to buy cottage cheese so that was omitted and it was still good but, I'll be adding it in next time. I used 3/4 lbs of hamburger meat and 1/2 lbs pork sausage and added a small can of sliced olives. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Wow! This is the best lasagna I've ever made! There were actual layers! All my oven lasagnas have been very runny. The flavor was really good!*I forgot Cottage cheese so that was vetoed from the recipe. I only had 3/4 lbs of hamburger meat so, I added about .5 lbs of Jimmie Dean all natural origanl pork sausage, and a small can on sliced black olives.I'm impressed! :) 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#1#0#I have made this several times. It is perfect. I use ricotta and cottage cheese. My family loves it.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I used a jar of Prego chunky sauce instead of the regular tomato sauce and a can of Del Monte diced tomatos with mild chiles and topped it with Cheddar cheese
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This is an excellent lasagna recipe. I am pretty much considered the crock pot queen of the family!!! This recipe gets an A++++++
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#1#0#5 stars with adjustmentsThis is the only way to make lasagna - I tried making lasagna the traditional way - what a pain.I've been using this recipe for several years. I use cheapy Hunts spag sauce (find it for 99 cents), sm can of tom paste and 8 oz tom sauce and add seasonings and ingredients (olives, green beans, red peppers to stretch, etc as desired). I usually make the sauce a day or two ahead. I've used up to 32 oz of cottage cheese and mixed with basil and seasonings and it was fine and different combinations of cheeses. I use an oval crockpot with no problem and if I'm in a rush, have cooked on high for 3 hours and it's perfect. Sorry so long, I can't believe I haven't reviewed before. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This was fantastic! I will never make a traditional lasagna again!! I reduced the recipe by half and used 1/2 can spaghetti sauce and an 8oz can of tomato sauce for the sauce. I was pleasantly surprised by how much better this was in the CP.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This was so much easier to make than my regular lasagna recipe. The pieces weren't quite as pretty but the taste was fantastic! 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#First time ever making lasagna. I thought the recipe was pretty good; however, I thought it was way too salty.I'll make it again but will definitely cut down on the salt. Other than that the family loved it. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#It was so easy! My son who is so picky even loved it.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This is now my go-to recipe. I make it for special occasions, and it never fails that someone wants the recipe before they go home.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Get rid of the cottage cheese. Super gross. Use Ricotta instead.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I made the recipe just as directed and it turned our delicious, moist and full of flavor. I didn't have just plain Oregano, but I had the Italian Seasoning spice so I used it. My family loved the recipe and I'll certainly make it again. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Pleasantly surprised! I used an oval crock pot. I was worried that the noodles wouldn't cook right because I had to overlap them in each layer. Turned out great. I don't see how this dish could turn out dry, there was plenty of moisture. I cooked for 5 hours. My family liked it! 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I did not care for this at all!! Dry and not flavorful. Maybe because I used a bigger crock pot then the 3 quart?? I did everyhting else as the recipe said. Only cooked for 4 hours. I prefer the oven baked version. sorry!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This is easy and delicious!!...loved that it could go in the crock pot!! making it tonight for the 2nd time :)
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Awsome,making it for the second time using regular noodles! Used spaghetti sauce with diced tomatoes,easy and tastes great!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Easy to assemble!! I used a jar of spaghetti sauce with the water to thin the sauce. Worked fine.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I love so many of the recipes posted on Taste Of Home, but this is not one. I would give it a 3 on taste test, but the biggest problem is what the slow cooker does to the noodles. The noodles are so overcooked you cannot hardly tell what is sauce and what is noodle. I like a firmer noodle. I also cut the cooking time down an hour, but still no better. Did anyone else have this problem? I might try it again but cook in the oven..
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#1#This is delicious and I make it all the time. I use italian sausage instead of ground beef, ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce, oh and a LOT more garlic than the recipe calls for, and I omit the parmesan. One thing that i've found is that it helps to use the crock pot liners when cooking this-when I don't use a liner the noodles get a little burnt around the edges but its perfect when using a liner...my husband raves about this too 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Great tasting easy recipe. My family loved it.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This was good but next time I think I will use spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce for a little more flavor and will try ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. It came out great, though. I thought it would fall apart when scooped out, but it didn't. Very easy. I cooked it all day and it was fine. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Making for the second time. It was great the first time but did add more seasonings and used cottage cheese and more italian cheese blend. Used a rectangle slow cooker that works great!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#this is a good starter recipe,as there is no taste as is. I did everything in the recipe but added 1 T. zesty italian seasoning,1 tsp. basil,1 tsp. thyme,2 tsp. pesto, mushroom's, less than a 1/4 c. each black and green olives. a good splash of white wine and balsamic vinegar. i would use regular lasagna noodles, run them under hot water to form to pan,don't boil them. as the no cook get's to mushy and looses their form. It would be great for a work pot luck,where you want to keep it warm. It makes a big batch and not recommended 4 two people as you have to keep it in the crock to keep it's form,in the refrigerator. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#My husband thought this was the best lasagna. Even better then my recipe that takes forever for me to make. I will be making this a lot!!!!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#1#0#Very tasty with a few tweaks. Used 1/2 c. water, added 1.5 tsp dry Italian seasoning, used regular noodles (not the no-boil kind), used 7 cups Italian 5 Cheese Blend instead of the individual mozzarella and parmesan. Was a little salty but otherwise was AWESOME!!!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I added Italian sausage for the more meaty version, plus a teaspoon of dried basil. Also substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese at the request of my wife. Definitely the best slow cooker lasagna recipe I've found! 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#1#0#Fixed this for my family visiting on a Sunday. They all loved it!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I have made this recipe a couple of times this time I made it with bottled spagetti sauce and regular uncooked lazagna noodles. It was great my boyfriend loved it said it was almost as good as my scratch.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Made this for dinner tonight. We all agreed that it's really good. Definately will make it again but will tweak it just a little w/ extra cheese and more seasoning -- Italian blend maybe. The flavor was just a little bland for us. I used regular lasagna noodles and they worked just fine. A keeper. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#for susie77....i have never like cottage cheese either, but my sister in law made us lasagna one time with cottage cheese instead of ricotta and i loved it!!! been making my lasanga that way ever since!!! i ususally make this recipe in the oven, but i think next time i will try it in the slow cooker.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Deliciously, unbelievable!! I added mild italian sausage (as suggested by another review)! Loved it!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#1#0#Lots of great cooks here. Thanks for the tips. Made this last night and it rocked. I used low fat everything, including turkey sausage (rinsed in hot water). I would cut down some on the liquid; even after sitting for 1/2 hr., it was a bit runny. Other than that -- five stars! (This review won't let me change to five from three.) 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Did not care for this recipe. Lasagna was very juicy. Also to much salt. Prefer a baked version.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#wow..cooking lasagne is always a pain.but now ..no problem..
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Did not care for I would much rather make mine in the oven .
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Easy to get all of the ingredients together--plug it in, turn it on and forget about it for a few hours. A keeper in my book.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Was in the process of making 60 cabbagerolls and needed the oven space for them when I came across this recipe. OMG this is fabulous. I added some green pepper pieces and zucchini I had on hand and am as I type am enjoying the slow cooked lasagna Thank you for a fabulous keeper recipe.MMMMMMMMMMMMM
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#some slow cookers like mine are oval and you can cut square''ish'' piece out 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#How do you serve it in the nice square pieces (like in the picture) when it is in the slow cooker?
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#As stated before, additional spices really make this recipe exceptional. I used ricotta with great results using same amount. Only four stars because needed just a couple modifications. Try this...wonderful and easy.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I have made this a few times. It is easy to alter the ingredients (turkey or just vegies instead of meat, etc.). I do like to turn the cooker off and let it set for a while before cutting. Yummy and easy.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Haven't made yet. Don't care for cottage cheese in recipes. Wonder if you could substitute ricotta instead? 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I make a similar recipe, so I would add that you do NOT need no cook lasagna noodles. Regular noodles, whole wheat noodles, or even rice noodles (we are gluten free) work just fine in this or similar recipes! 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#It was so easy to make and my entire family liked it!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I added 1lb of italian sausage along with the ground beef so it was meater....Also added 2 cups extra moz cheese...used sweet basil instead of oregano and extra of that too...Turned out GREAT!!!!!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I would recommend more spice, oregano and basil
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This is great. I've made it many times now. The only change I make is to add one or 2 extra teaspoons of oregano or Italian seasoning. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#THIS ROCKED! It was so easy to make and everyone I have made it for raves about how yummy it tastes!!!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I made this for the first time today and it will definitely be part of our rotation. I used 1 1/2 jars of Prego pasta sauce with mushrooms, and did half hamburger and half sausage, and tripled the garlic. I omitted the parm. cheese and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese as i didn't have any and only used 1/2 cup water and no bake noodles. I found that 3 1/2 hours on low was the perfect time...they were a little overdone at 4 hours. Next time I will use more spice and maybe spicy sausage, also i think this would be good with some mushrooms. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#great very easy, I'll never make lasagna the old fashioned way again! 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This is great! I made it for Sunday dinner and my daughter has been requesting it constantly. I'm making it again tomorrow. It cooks while I pack for the move. The recipe is definitely going to the new house! 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I have made this 5 times and changed the meat each time. I even used canned Spagetti Sauce once and it turned out great. My family loves it
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I've never been able to master making lasagne. I've made this several times, and it turns out great everytime. It's so much quicker and easier than the traditional method. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This one is a keeper!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I was worried about the cottage cheese (as I am not usually a big fan...) but, I followed directions exactly as written (including the cottage cheese) and it turned out perfectly! My husband says its the best lasagna he has ever had! It was very easy to make. Definitely a recipe to keep!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This was better than I had expected. It turned out great even with all the broken noodles I pieced together. It's just as good as oven cooked lasagna, if not better. I will definitely use this recipe a lot in the summer when I don't want to warm the house using the oven. Keeper! 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#AWESOME!!!! I did use ricotta chese in place of the cottage cheese. also I added some garlic powder, onion powder, basil, and itaian seasoning. very very good! and I do not care for most Lasagnas!! but this one I will make again and again!! a keeper for sure!!!!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Was great and was easy to make. Everone enjoyed it..
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Every time I've made this recipe I've used canned sauce so I can't say whether it's better using the tomato sauce, paste and oregano but it is very good. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I've made this a quite a few times and my family loves it! I sometimes throw on an extra layer which is nice and is something you can't do in a baking pan. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#MMmmMMmmMMmmmm.... I love coming home to this scrumptious lasagna after weekend errands. At one time, I did have some of the tomato ingredients so I substituted the sauce ingredients for a can of spaghetti sauce, and it still came out just as amazing. Good stuff!!!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#We made with with Turkey Hamburger to cut calories...it was amazing. I love this recipe!!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Pretty good
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Family favorite - fantastic and easy for the holidays!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This is one of my go to recipes. I add a can of green beans and olives and Italian seasoned diced tomatoes to stretch and I use a red pepper with the ground beef. I also use a crockpot liner (cleanup ease wins over possible carcinogens).
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Easy and delicious! Who would have thought you could make lasagna in a slow cooker??? Mine was done after only 3 hours though. Definitely would make again. Leftovers warm up good. Emailing this recipe to friends and family. It is a keeper!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I love this receipe, so easy and tastes GREAT!!!! This is one of our family favorites!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#yum-o!!!!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I didn't use the recipe for the sauce. Instead I used 1 1/2 jars of sauce. This worked great. I used regular noodles and didn't pre-cook them, but just added the extra sauce from normal. All the teenage boys at church are begging me to bring it again. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Easy to make. I usually add some fresh baby spinach between noodles and it is just delish!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#very easy and good!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Really good. I added more oregano and 1-2 tsp. Italian seasoning as well.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#after reading the reviews i was skeptical about making this in crock pot. no soggy noodles and no sticking to pot. it turned out perfect. only cooked it for 3 hours. definitely a keeper. next time the only thing i would add is to put mozz. cheese on top maybe half hour before serving(just so it melts)
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#i have made this recipe twice and the noodles are always very soggy, even when I lessened the cooking time. the flavour is good though.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#excellent
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#My family absolutely loves this lasagna. Its quick and easy and satisfies everyone.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This is easy and contains items I always have. Already made at least 3 times. Gone quickly.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Oh my goodness! I've cooked this---a long time ago---and everyone loved it! I lost the recipe and have tried to find it for a long time! My husband just asked me the other day why I hadn't made that good lasagna in such a long time! THANK GOODNESS FOR THE INTERNET!!! And Thank You Quick Cooking!!! 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This lasagna was fantastic! It was so easy to make. I couldn't be more pleased. I used fat free cottage cheese to lighten it up a little. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#It was the first dish gone at the potluck (I fed ~ 20)! Super easy to make. I added a few spices and put parsley on the top, it looked 5 star! Everyone was looking for seconds, planning to make it later this week!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I really love this recipe its one of my daughters favorites. Only thing i altered on this recipe was the cooking time. I only cooked it 3 hours instead of the recommended 4 and it did not burn in the bottom of my crock pot like it had previously when i made it and it was perfectly done.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This has become one of my family favorites. Very easy. My family won't eat lasagna any other way. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I was a little worried about making lasagna in a crockpot but it turned out wonderful. My children and husband loved it. No left overs. I will make this again.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I love this recipe. I use ricotta instead of cottage cheese.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#It tasted good, but burned the bottom of my slow cooker. Make sure you spray with a vegetable oil before putting it together.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#The best thing to use are the liners,you put the liner in the crock pot,put the food into the liner and cook as directed on your recipe,NO CLEAN UP!! there great even for your crock pot cakes, just lift liner out when done, it's that easy. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This was the best lasagna I have ever had!
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This is one of the best Lasagna recipes I have ever tried! It turned out great and was so easy to prepare and leave to cook! It's also perfect for customizing to your own tastes. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#I've made this many times. Great! 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This was absolutely wonderful!!! I had a bit leftover, and my son actually had it for breakfast the next morning! I will definetly be making this again, ALOT!!! Thanks.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Was very happy with the way this lasagna tasted. This is a keeper.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#This recipe was great! It works equally well with normal (not no-cook) lasagna noodles that have been boiled for half the prescribed time.
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#1#0#My family loves this recipe, as do I. It works much better than the old fashioned way as Sherri7 put it. I think it is a wonderful recipe. Our family would have it all the time, but that isn't a good idea. So it is an occasional thing. We love it. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#What specifically was wrong with it?
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#Will NEVER make this again. Was terrible. Stick to making lasagna the old fashioned way in the oven WAY better. I think lasagna is not meant to cook for 5 hours. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#No you can't use cheese in a can, and every grocery store should have to no boil noodles, i live is a small town and we have them. 
Slow-Cooker Lasagna#0#0#on the parmesan cheese, can it be the kind like Kraft in the tin can? Aslo, where do you find No Cook Noodles ? Honestly I have never seen them or neither had the reason to look for them! Thanks so much for your time.Beverly_GaHave a great day!!! 
Vegetarian Linguine#7#0#Very easy and very good!! I didn't have a tomato so I used a 14.5 oz can of fire roasted, chopped tomatoes (slightly drained the rest of the liquid cooked out). This is a keeper and will be made again!!!
Vegetarian Linguine#2#0#My family loved it yeah!??
Vegetarian Linguine#12#1#Yay!! A good tasting recipe! This is indeed vegetarian even with the cheese. That other person doesn't realize that vegan recipes have no cheese, but vegetarian recipes allow for cheese, eggs, etc. Tasted great! A keeper! Thank you!!!
Vegetarian Linguine#4#0#Delicious! I was not sure if my husband would like this since there was no meat in it. But he really liked it , the mushrooms take place of meat. It also helped having used my homemade pasta! Will be making this again for sure!!
Vegetarian Linguine#5#1#YUMMY! Made this last night, made as written. Will definitely be making this often. Only change I will make is to serve with the cheese on the side instead of toss all at once. Looking forward to the leftovers! Thank you Jane!
Vegetarian Linguine#1#2#This is a winner! Creamy and delicious vegetables. Some other reviews commented on the cheese seizing up, just add with the heat off and it's perfect! 
Vegetarian Linguine#0#0#This was a quick and surprisingly good meatless meal. I made it as written and baked some corn muffins to go with it.
Vegetarian Linguine#1#0#I'm going to give this 5 stars even though I didn't get any due to the fact they ate it all before I got home!! I picked this recipe because we needed a meatless dinner to shake things up. It also looked to be rather easy and quick to make which I knew would be appreciated by whoever ended up in the kitchen making it while I was volunteering. I was so hungry when I got home and ready for a bite only to find it was gone. Based on the fact that they couldn't control themselves to leave enough for 2 of us coming up late, I trust it was good! 
Vegetarian Linguine#0#0#Super delicious and simple to make. It was a hit in my home. Hubby had seconds. Thank you.
Vegetarian Linguine#1#0#Very easy to make and so tasty.
Vegetarian Linguine#0#0#Super easy to make! Made for a friend and I for dinner, I'm not a vegetarian but she is and I wanted something we'd both like. I added a little more butter at the end and topped with grated Parmesan. So tasty!
Vegetarian Linguine#2#0#Great great recipe! Very fresh. I added more garlic and a bit of pasta sauce for more flavor. The family enjoyed it. I will be making this again! A !
Vegetarian Linguine#0#0#I made this but cut the recipe in half for two people. It wasn't bad but seemed to lack something, rather bland. For us this is not a keeper. I didn't like the clumping of the shredded provolone cheese. 
Vegetarian Linguine#3#0#My 16 year old daughter decided to go vegetarian,, so I try to incorporate some vegetarian meals into the meal line-up. This turned outd out great. I used Shredded Italian cheese mixture instead of the other two cheese..
Vegetarian Linguine#3#0#This is delicious. I will definitely be making this often. The only problem I had was the cheese melting and clumping together when I mixed it into the vegies and linguine. The next time I make it I will add the basil to the vegies and linguine mixture and toss. Then only sprinkle the cheeses on top to serve. Thanks for a great tasting recipe.
Vegetarian Linguine#0#0#Excellent. I will be making this again and again.
Vegetarian Linguine#0#0#Loved it! I will be making this again. I added too much basil, but you couldn't even tell. VERY good! 
Vegetarian Linguine#0#0#Mmmm...yum. I enjoyed making and eating this, but it wasn't really somthing to remeber. 
Vegetarian Linguine#1#0#I've made this recipe many times and everyone in my family loves it. It has a lot of flavor! I've made it as a side dish and a main dish. 
Vegetarian Linguine#0#0#This was so good. I also used some chicken in it.
Vegetarian Linguine#0#0#Yummmm. Loved it.
Vegetarian Linguine#2#0#I added squash and put the cheese on the individual plate. This was the perfect dish for my family. I have a son who is allergic to dairy. He loved this dish! So happy I tried it. It was very easy to make as well.
Vegetarian Linguine#0#0#Great recipe.
Vegetarian Linguine#0#0#as a vegetarian i am always looking for new stuff to make, this was verry delicious and super easy to make, and the whole family loved it!! i plan on taking it to my county fair for my 4H foods project, i hope for good results :)
Vegetarian Linguine#0#0#The whole family loved this! I added chicken and used whole wheat linguine. It was very yummy!
Vegetarian Linguine#0#0#Great recipe, quick, easy and delicious...Added a little more garlic (personal preference)...I will be making it again :)
Vegetarian Linguine#0#0#This dinner is quick, easy, and has lots of flavor! I added an extra clove of garlic for a little more kick and it was delicous!
Vegetarian Linguine#0#0#I try to make it several times a month!
Vegetarian Linguine#0#0#This was WONDERFUL! I did add 1 chicken breast b/c I have it STUCK in my head that i have to have a meat for dinner~ But it was a great dinner! Even my little boy loved it!
Vegetarian Linguine#0#0#Delicious! I loved all the vegetables, and the provolone cheese was the perfect amount and flavor. Couldn't find green onions at the grocery, so I left those out, but otherwise made the recipe exactly as stated. 
Vegetarian Linguine#0#1#this sounds like a super recipe and i'm going to make it for my supper will let you all know how it was 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#5#0#This is the first time I wrote a review. I absolutely hate when I read reviews and they say all the stuff they add that's not in the recipe! With that being said I absolutely loved this recipe - I did double the sauce but made it exactly like the recipe and I put the pork chops on the bottom and then added the potatoes! You could cut the pork chops with a fork it was amazing! Thank you for the recipe!!!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Actually, although the older recipe used canned soup the benefit of this version is creating a homemade replacement version rather than canned.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I can't ever seem to get my pork chops tender. Any recommendations? 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#13#10#I was not impressed. I found the potatoes bland and needed something. The chops were overcooked but I did use loin chops. Still an hour and a half I think would dry out most chops. I wouldn' t follow this recipe again without some serious changes. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#11#6#A good casserole type recipe. Great flavour and presentation. The pork was of course overdone so I think next time I'd be tempted to just brown one side or perhaps put them in raw and just broil for a couple of minutes at the end. I cut back a little on the broth and added a dollop of cream just to spoil myself. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#4#9#Can refrigerated or frozen potatoes be used!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#4#1#Very tastey
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#5#1#Delicious and easy to prepare for a weekday dinner.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#29#4#Pretty good. I think it needs a little more seasoning, like S/P but overall, it is a very tasty recipe and one I will make again. I think buckey's suggestion to brown chops, remove and make gravy in the same pan is a good suggestion. All the flavor is in the bottom of the pan. Mine were done in less than an hour. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#42#2#Very good and flavourful. Brown the chops first in pan and then remove to make the sauce. Makes for easy cleanup.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#3#2#The potatoes were AMAZING, but the chops were a bit dry. Next time I may try adding a lemon or lime flavor to it to spice it up a bit.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#6#0#Potatoes GREAT, chops just ok.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#25#12#Wonderful! We both loved this dish. I did not modify the ingredients, but I did make it with one pan...Cook the pork chops in oven proof pan and take out of pan, add the flour to the chicken broth and pour it into the pan, add the potatoes (I added sliced carrots) and cooked for 1 hour covered and 1/2 hour uncovered. Delicious! And only one pan.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#0#A delicious dish. I will definitely make again.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#13#1#Agree with John- this looks great, very easy to make, but despite how wonderful it looks, it doesn't have a lot of flavor. For folks who can't have a lot of flavorful things due to diet restrictions this may be a really good recipe. Good recipe to build on- perhaps fry the potato slices some to golden brown in the leftover pork chop drippings, add some garlic somewhere - it needs more umph for me. r- 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#0#Easy recipe and very tasty. I will make it again.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#11#Although this sounds good to some it is not by any means our favourite pork chop recipe. Ours is still, from the applewood smoker on the deck. BBQ'd or smoked chops are the absolute best. Breaded with spices and Panko, egg wash, flour etc is the next. Done the way in this recipe they become a little too tough and relatively tasteless. Definitely will not make this one. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#2#0#This recipe brought a smile to my face as I remembered my mother making this delicious meal often. I had forgotten that wonderful memory and I thank you for posting it. I will be making it soon.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#79#5#I enjoys these reviews. Rarely make the recipes. Jaw-dropping amazing how mean some of these reviews are. That someone would sign in and go out of their way to tell someone learn to cook, this was terrible, what's wrong with you people, this is a recipe site! Why do you have to be infect your personality onto this nice place by being jerks?
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#So easy to make! I have made with boneless chops but they are more dried out.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#1#Bernice Morris, recipe is GREAT! BTW, I was born in Marshfield, Mo. Do you know any Hastings or Tuckers???
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#7#2#I think my family must have been last :) We never made separate white sauce.. we layered potatoes, flour, butter pats , salt and pepper..then we poured milk over the top ...if we had pork chops as our meat we put them on top of the potatoes..
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#6#0#I made this according to recipe except sprinkled Lawry's on the chops, baked the potatoes and onions covered for 30 minutes then added pork chops and baked uncovered for 30 minutes. Pretty good. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#6#1#I read all the reviews first and then made this dish. I preboiled the potatoes after they were sliced, then used that pan to make the sauce to put over the potatoes. I seared the pork steaks in the iron skillet, moved them to a platter and arranged the potatoes and onions in the iron skillet and poured over the sauce. I put the pork steaks on top of the potatoes and baked this for 30 minutes covered. I removed the foil and baked it 15 more minutes. Everything was done and delicious. My family raved. I will make this again.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#4#0#Not impressed won't make this again.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Sounds great, but, three pans in order to make one dish! No way.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#10#2#Delicious! But I tweaked it a little. I baked the potatoes and gravy first for half hour. And I put onion powder in the gravy. I also marinated the pork with cajun seasoning and olive oil for a few hours before hand. Then I coated the pork with corn starch to hold the moisture inside. Pan fried it with a little olive oil enough to sear it. Then add to the potatoes. And I keep it closed the whole time. Bake another 30 min in 325F
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#6#1#I made this for dinner tonight, but cut it down to 2 pork chops for the two of us. I made it per the recipe, except for the addition of poultry seasoning sprinkled on the chops (I like this on chops) and the potatoes (I thought they could probably use more than just salt and pepper). I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes and onions very thin. The potatoes were delicious, but after 25 minutes the 1/2 inch thick pork chops were dry and way overdone. I could not see baking this for the recommended hour and a half since the chops are browned, which par-cooks them. I would recommend checking for doneness early. I did have my doubts about scalloped potatoes with chicken broth, but they were so good I would make them on their own next time. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Made this for my family
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#2#1#Used no salt added chicken broth, did not add salt, after 1.5 hours meat was overdone and inedible and potatoes and onions merely okay. Waste of money on pork chops. I will never make this recipe again! Salinity was fine!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#0#Excellent flavor and very tender.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#9#1#I have made this recipe several times with a little tweaking. I use pork steaks instead of pork chops and I cook them for about 3 hours at 300 degrees. the pork chops come out fall apart tender and the potatoes are nice and yummy. Two pork steaks and potatoes give my wife and i enough for two meals. But these are really good. Brown your pork in a cast iron skillet that is really hot so you get the nice sear. I have also browned them on the grill and then put them in the oven which is really good as well.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#2#0#Reminds me of my mother's recipe, except she would use Cream of Mushroom soup. She would sometimes use rice instead of potatoes. Delicious and heartwarming. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#3#2#FYI to the reviewer who said ...how many servings...it does say...6 chops, 6 servings. Just sayin ??
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#10#1#Brown the chops then bake for an hour? I would think this would overcook the chops. Chops are best at 145° f, which is USDA safe for today's pork. I have found browning is often sufficient to nearly reach this temp. Cooking according to this recipe is a throwback to when a pork chop had to be cooked until it was dry. Cooking above 145°f squeezes the internal fat and juice out of the meat fibers as they contract. The hotter the meat, the more squeezing. Pork today is much leaner than years ago when it had to be cooked much higher to be safe to eat (to avoid Trichinosis). I suggest baking the potatoes and sauce first then add the browned meat maybe the last 15 minutes depending on the internal temperature of the browned chops. Ideally, pull when the meat reaches 145°f. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#0#I make a similar recipe with cream of celery soup diluted with 1/2 can of milk. Heat the soup mix in pan after browning chops. Otherwise, recipe is the same. A favorite of my family and all I serve it to.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#39#Looks terrible calorific and basically junk food. Please learn how to cook!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This recipe was easy to downsize, l used 4 chops. I enjoyed the broth instead of milk. I'd make it both ways in the future. I served it with oven baked onions. Nice combo. Janet. VFE 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I love all of your recipes but I wish you would say how many it feeds.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#2#0#Perfect and extremely tasty and easy!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#2#0#Pork chops aren't always my first choice but love this recipe. Whole family enjoys it. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#5#For my heart patient husband I had to leave out the coconut (regretfully) but otherwise followed the recipe.By far the BEST carrot cake EVER! I finally just printed out a bunch of recipes to hand out, everybody raved over it and it is even better the next day (if there is any left over!)
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This recipe had great flavor. It was fancy enough to serve to guests, but easy enough for an anytime dish. Leftovers were amazing too.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#MADE THIS TONIGHT. I USED MILK INSTEAD OF BROTH AND ADDED CHEESE INTO THE SAUCE AND IN BETWEEN THE LAYERS....YUMMY
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#0#Yummy. Will make it again. Mom many years ago would make it. Did not last very long. Mom said that the potatoes tasted a lot better the next day. This is my go to recipe.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I make my scalloped potatoes with cream of mushroom or a cream soup of any kind .I cut the soup with 1/2 can milk The soup gives it much flavor and no need to make a white sauce. It's a lot easier and delicious. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#2#0#I found a similar recipe in (dare I say it?): a Betty Crocker cookbook years ago. It actually uses the BC scalloped potatoes in a box. Super easy. Of course anything home made beats box, but when you're short on time you do what you have to do. I adore TOH recipes. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Great recipe! Family loved it. Will make again.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I have used this recipe several times and is easy to make and everyone love's it 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Delicious and easy to make.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I have a similar recipe. My recipe follows as yours, I just add pimentos. Great recipe.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Delicious.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This sounds amazing. Does anyone know how long to cook it for two pork chops?
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#0#Used the onion soup marinade. Also put chicken broth in pan after Browning pork chops to get the flavor from Browning and then added it to the roux. Also saiutade onions. Excellent.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I didn't make any changes and found this recipe using one sliced onion would have been much better with less onion. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Put a package of lipton onion soup mix in the chicken broth in a gallon freezer bag with the pork chops. shake it up and put in refrigerator over nite. then proceed with step 1. Not enough flavor is solved. slice potatoes thin and only bake 1 hour for juicy chops. with you roux and onion powder soup it is not runny and VERY flavorful.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#0#I followed what the reviewer Wintere suggested and OMG - will make these again. They were fantastic. But I cut the entire recipe down for 2 since there is only me. Thanks again.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#A friend fixed this dinner for us many years ago. We loved it and got the recipe from her. This is one of my husband's favorite dishes. It's a winner! 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I used boneless/skinless cutlets.Excellent Dish.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#2#1#Wow!!! Just finished cleaning up after making these for dinner tonight. Everyone loved them! I liked the fact that the pork chops stayed moist, but crispy at the same time; Baking them with the potatoes make it simple. I coated the pork chops in 1/2 C Flour 1 tsp Paprika 1/2 tsp Salt 1/2 tsp Pepper 1 tsp Oregano. For the sauce, I chopped the onion and sauteed it in the butter, added 3 TBS of the seasoned flour mixture, and followed the rest of the recipe as written. I served this with a side of steamed carrots and buttermilk biscuits. Yum!! Thank you so much for sharing. I will make this one of my regular recipes for Pork Chops.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Great potato sauce - better than any cream of XXXX soup
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#0#I have a recipe by the same name, but it's a bit different. You dredge the pork chops in seasoned flour, then saute them in oil in a skillet till browned. Then remove the pork chops, add 1 tablespoon to the drippings in the pan, add more seasoning if needed, then add 1 cup milk. Cook on medium heat until thick. Slice potatoes and onions and layer in a baking dish. Pour gravy over the potatoes and onions, then top with the pork chops. Bake at 400 degrees, covered, for 45 minutes. Remove cover and bake for another 15 minutes....delicious 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#0#Unfortunately I felt like this recipe had very little taste. I won't be making it again. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#The pork chops were delicious, but I was actually even more impressed with how flavorful the potatoes were. My kids loved them too! Everything was done perfectly after the first hour, so I didn't bake any further after uncovering. I will definitely make this again. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Delicious! Easy to prepare and cooked perfectly.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I'm not a big fan of pork chops. Every recipe I've ever tried to make turned out dry and flavorless. I was shocked at how good this was. I followed the directions exactly and used loin chops. Besides the long cook time, it's relatively easy to prepare and doesn't have any crazy ingredients. My husband loved it too. For potatoes without cheese, they were very flavorful. We did add the paprika and (dried not fresh) parsley at the end. Next time I make it I am going to try breading the pork chops in Italian bread crumbs because they were good but I thought there was room for more flavor. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Followed the recipe except I only baked for 1 hour. My husband said they were the most tender pork chop he had ever had.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#0#Worst dish ever.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This recipe received rave reviews from the menfolk in my family. I liked that it was very easy to make. I enjoyed the taste, too.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#great recipe. Since there are only 2 of us, I halved it with no problems. Also made with like amount of chicken broth made with bullion since I was out of broth. Tasted great and met with Husband approval! Watch the salt amount if using bullion or not homemade chicken broth. Skipped extra 30 min uncover time as they were done already.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#1#First time writing a review but wanted to comment after following some of the other reviewer recommendations. Sadly, I should have tried the recipe first as written but so many said that additional sauce was needed. So rather than double the ingredients, I did a 1.5X the amounts and had enough sauce to sufficiently cover the potatoes. After an hour, I removed the foil and there was so much sauce/juice that the dish was swimming in liquid. I literally spooned out all of the extra sauce which easily made up the extra 1/2 that I added. The potatoes were very tender (used a mandolin for thinner slices) and the sauce was a hit -- delicious. Next time I would brown the chops and only add to the dish at the last 30 minutes of cooking. I used 1 inch chops and they turned out dryer than I'd like. Will make again but without the extra sauce 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I followed the directions and to me it was a waste of meat. The chops were horrible, very hard. Potatoes were good with the gravy.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Very tasty and moist! The only thing I would change would be to skip the last 30 minutes uncovered. It seems to dry the pork out. Mine were done in the hour the chops were covered. Delicious!!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Absolutely delicious. One of our favorite recipes.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#MMM MMM Good! Easy comfort food. Keeper!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#It's the first time that I try to prepare something so easy, It turned delicious and even my 3 yo son enjoyed. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Prepping takes a bit of time but the meal was good. Only fixed four pork chops because there are only two of us. Potatoes were better the second night warmed up with the remaining two chops.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I'm thinking 1 hour is too long to cook these chops. I think I would just brown the chops and put them on top of my scalloped potatoes that have been in the oven for awhile and let everything finish at the same time. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#0#The gravy was bland..no flavor. I added some sharp cheddar to the broth mixture and it made it much tastier. More like a scalloped potato.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#2#This recipe claims the prep is 25 mins it has been over 1 hour and 20 mins and i have only managed to chop my potatoes, make the gravy which wasnt enough to cover my meat so ill be making another batch and cook 1 pork chop will never make again i only made 4 pork chops because i was so hunrgry and felt like passing out didnt have the energy to make the other 4 chops. It took 1 hour and 15 mins to bake on 350 for an hour then 375 for 15 mins. The flavor was delicious og the gravy i added some garlic in it an my potatoes were perfect but my chops were dry tasting. My grandma used to bake her chops with potatoes and i was craving it but this is definently not my grandmas way of making it her chops were very juicy and delicious and the gravy was more liquid like but she is passed so the recipe is still a mystery ??but this helped curbed that craving. I do suggest not adding salt to this dish because the chicken broth already has alot of salt in it!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Very good base recipe. The gravy was tasty and easy. I made it in the crock pot and cooked it for 4 hours on low. The gravy was thinner than it would have been, but we didn't mind, and it kept the pork moist. I added a lot more salt and pepper, and some rosemary. It needed the extra flavor. We served it with broccoli. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This is great! Loved how the pork came out and the potatoes cooked perfectly with a gravy sauce.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#We really liked this. Great flavor and very tasty.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This recipe was a hit with my family and easy to prepare
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#1#This recipe was a favorite of our six children when they were growing up. Easy to prepare & easy clean-up. I doubled the recipe as they got older & added sliced carrots to the potatoes to stretch it a bit. Our family likes pork chops with barbeque sauce, so we had plenty of flavor!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#0#Decided to make this recipe and read reviews prior to making it...I doubled the gravy...everything came out so tender but it was so, so, so BLAND even with extra seasoning to gravy and pork chops ...Not sure I'll make this again 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This recipe is absolutely delicious!! I am not a big cook, but during a rare week off for me, I spent a lot of time on the Taste of Home website searching for recipes I felt I could handle. I came across this one and had everything I needed to make it. I reduced the cooking time a little because the pork chops I had were boneless and thin cut, but everything was tender and delicious. Even my teenage son, who is a pretty picky eater, loved it!! I would definitely recommend giving this one a try.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I had some thick boneless pork chops in the fridge so I searched TOH. I wanted something I could pop in the oven. These were fantastic. Will definitely make again.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#The very best, bar none! Will make it MANY times more, thanks Bernice.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#With a few little ones running around and being very pregnant this was easy to make and tasted great. Thank you for helping me out Bernice :)
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I follow this recipe to the tee making a double batch of the gravy. My four picky children all eat this and my even pickier husband usually has seconds. It has become a staple in our monthly food rotations. Something we all look forward to eating. Yummy!!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Amazingly delicious
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Great recipe cooking time to long pork dried out,reheated next day made with pre cooked pork sausage balls covered with grated mozzarella good also.potatoes still great.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I have made this and it is delish. I have also used boneless chops and instead of the chicken broth, I have used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup mixed with a 1/2 cup of sour cream. Both are wonderful.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This was very good, but I forgot to trim the fat off the chops. The casserole was a little too greasy. I'm going to try this with boneless skinless chicken breasts -- has anyone tried this? 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#So easy and great comfort food! Doesn't freeze well. I cooked it in a slow cooker on low for 3 hrs and worked great. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Love this recipe, especially during the cold months! Would I be able to put this in a slow cooker too instead of baking it?
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#0#This was good... not great
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Easy and delicious. Will make again! Next time I will do as many others recommended, put the chops on the bottom, and for the last 30 minutes put them on top.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#1#I make this recipe all the time, although cut back on the amount as it is just myself to cook for now. Like others, I add more broth to make a bit more sauce, and put the chops on the bottom to cook until near the end, and then transfer them to the top. I do add garlic though and a little dijon mustard as I find the dish a bit bland otherwise. A great dish though, no matter how you cook it.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Great recipe. I didn't bother to brown the pork chops and it still came out great. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I've made this recipe more times than I can count....because the chops are ALWAYS tender and the potato/onion combination is addictive! It never fails to please anyone sitting at my table. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Very nice indeed!!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#The only difference I made was that I put the chops in the middle of the potatoes
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Fabulous! Super easy!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Great flavor! Do put the chops in the gravy so they don't dry out. Definitely double the gravy! 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Made this tonight but since 2 of us most nights I made about 1/2 the receipt...This and green salad and my hubby was very happy and I was too.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Easy and great flavor!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Lovely dish. Next time I'll use a little less butter. My almost-4-year old also enjoyed it! 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#My dad made this when I was younger. Never really knew how he made it. It is one of my favorites!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#wonderful! I sprinkled the paprika in the sauce mixture.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Made this a one pot meal by browning the pork chops in a 12 cast iron skillet then removing them to a plate (I only had 4 - 1 loin chops). Next I made the gravy scraping the bits from browning the pork chops. Had read reviews and put the pork chops back in the gravy followed by the onions and potatoes. Pulled the pork chops back to the top during the last 30 minutes. Perfect! Excellent meal and hardly any dishes. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Very good
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#My family loved it, but I would cut the salt in half next time. I even used my own homemade chicken broth without salt, just poultry seasoning. I too cooked the chops on the bottom and they came out perfectly moist and fork tender. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Wow! I made this dish tonight and my entire family LOVED it (& they can be very picky--3 teenagers)!!! I had 2 packs of pork chops and followed this recipe for 1 pack and a different recipe for the other pack. This one won - - hands down! I used everything listed in the recipe, but used Lawry's Seasoning Salt with the pepper. This is by far the best pork chop dish I have ever made. Something to note: After an hour, I took the cover (tin foil) off and checked the pork chops and potatoes. They were done, therefore, my meal was done in 1 hour instead of 1 1/2 hours. I'm so glad I checked them so that they didn't end up dry. This was an easy and delicious 5 star meal that I will be making often! (*I did not need to double the sauce because this recipe made plenty of sauce.) 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This dish was delicious . I added cheddar cheese and it was tasty.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#It was delicious. Everyone in my family enjoyed it.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Made this tonight and it is fantastic! Easy and flavorful, the pork chops are tender and juicy. A great, hearty meal!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#If doubling the sauce, do you also double the salt?
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#It really looks excellent and delicious!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I have been making this dish for years. My family love it . They are meat and potatoes men. The meat is very tender and flavorful.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#So many of the recipes are on the presumption that everyone has a large family. I am only 1 person so these don't benefit me. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#My husband is a very picky man, it can get frustrating, when I cooked this for him he actually complimented my cooking!!! Needless to say, I'm making it tonight again :) 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#WOW!! This dish was the best ever!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This recipe has that authentic down-home flavor! It deserves a blue ribbon.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#0#I really enjoyed this recipe. I did do the chops on the bottom like others have recommended but they were still a tap dry for my tasting, I'll double up on the sauce next time. I also threw in portobello mushrooms which my wife thought was a nice touch... I will be having this dish again! Thanks for the recipe! 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Excellent!!! Best Pork Chops & Scalloped potatoes ever! Our whole family loves them! I also put the chops on the bottom, and then in the last half hour after removing the cover, I brought them to the top, to brown up a little bit more. 15 minutes one way, then turn them over and 15 minutes more. This time can vary, if the potatoes arnd chops already tender...may only need 10 minutes on for each side. Enjoy...pure deee-licious! ??
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Am I ever glad I read the reviews and decided to make this dish. It is SO GOOD!! Put the chops on the bottom and doubled the sauce, even added a few carrots that we had leftover and my husband kept saying how yummy it was. Nice for a winter comfort food dish!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#My family really enjoys this. I do put the pork chops on the bottom of the pan, piling the potatoes and sauce on top of the bone-in chops. They are always tender. I love the gravy/sauce so I double it. Thanks for the recipe.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#A great all-in-one meal. I added some extra seasoning to give it some more zip, but it's a really nice, simple, and hearty meal that my family enjoyed. I will definitely try the tip about putting the pork chops on the bottom next time, because they were slightly dry. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This recipe is great and so easy!! My whole gang loved it and there were no left-overs! Thanks for sharing!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#1#This was excellent, in fact my wife texted me this morning and said that it was the best pork chop she had ever eaten! I did however do as advised and place the meat on the bottom and that kept it very moist. I also doubled the amount of sauce. YUM!!!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Absolutely delicious! The best pork chops ever! To save on cleanup I browned the pork chops first, removed, and made the gravy in the same pan. I had extra onion, so I placed a slice on top. and poured some gravy over everything. A very easy recipe with great results! Plan to make it again.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This recipe came out in Taste of Home magazine several years ago, and I have been making it for my husband and our four children since then. It is one of their very favorite meals! My oldest daughter has been known to request it as her birthday dinner or on weekends when she comes home to visit. This is easy to prepare and Yummmy!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Doubled the gravy as suggested and it was ridiculously good. I made it for the first time a few days ago and hubby is already asking for it again tonight. This is now one of our favorite recipes!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#It was quick and easy to prepare. I doubled the sauce as others had suggested. Ever since I made it, my family has asked when we can have it again! Especially my husband, who usually doesn't care for pork chops! 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I like to double the sauce so we have extra to top the pork chops with gravy. I also increase the potatoes to 8 cups.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#we really enjoyed this make sure your pork chops have a little fat on them.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#The potatoes are excellent. The pork chops were dry, but I think it's because they were too thin. They say 3/4 chops for a reason :-). 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#horrible
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#made this recipe in the crock pot; it was OK, but the pork chops were bland. It needs something to flavor the meat more. I will try it in the oven next time; if not better, then will not make again.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I have been making this recipe for years - it's a favorite. I sometimes make just the potatoes and substitute vegetable broth to serve vegetarians in my family. Delicious! 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This is one of ours family favorite recipe
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I made it for my coworkers and they loved it.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#0#To keep chops from drying out and staying tender, I put the chops on the BOTTOM and the potatoes on top. Turns out tender and moist!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#A simple and comforting dish. Loved it!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#Easy and delicious!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This recipe was a great dinner. The most time consuming part was cutting up the potatos. If you have not every made scalloped potatos its time consuming
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#1#0#This was DELICIOUS! The only thing I would do different would be to double the sauce. It soaks into the potatoes, and then there is not enough to use with the pork. This is definitely in my rotation.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This was a great recipe. However the meat was not as tender. Not sure what I did wrong.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#I first saw this recipe in the very first addition of TOH which I still have. I have made this several times for family and friends and they all love it. Thanks TOH
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This has been a family favorite ever since it was first published--one of the first recipes I tried from TOH! I make the recipe as is, with great results. I use boneless chops. The food processor makes quick work of slicing the potatoes.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This recipe was great,very quick and easy to make. We will certainly make it again.
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This recipe has that authentic down-home flavor! I doubled the gravy ingredients and added 1 teaspoon FRESH lemon juice and 2 teaspoons Kitchen Bouquet just to give it the best color. Also, I don't think it needs to cook as long as the recipe says - I only cooked it 1 hr. 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This dish comes together very easily, and is delicious. My husband had 2 servings; he generally does not care for scalloped potatoes. I know we'll be having this again and again. Thank you for sharing your recipe!! 
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#OMG! this is a great recipe! I used my own homemade chicken stock & the potatoes were fabulous!
Pork Chops with Scalloped Potatoes#0#0#This is a great recipe! I make it often and my family really likes it. My son in law doesn't like scalloped potatoes, but he really likes this dish. It's a great meal to make for a new mom. I serve it with peas.
Chicken and Dumplings#8#11#I had a beautiful pan of dumplings. Turned off the heat and went to get our plates and not a dumpling in sight. They all fell and turned into hard lumps of dough. I don't know what happened. Was trying something new for my hubby and didn't turn out 
Chicken and Dumplings#30#32#southern dumplings are not made with egg, carrots, or celery. I just use chicken, and chicken broth, salt, pepper, butter. For dumplings I use self-rising flour, small amount of shortening (about the size of a small egg) and water. mix this up till stiff. Cut in strips or pinch off,) I pinch mine, then Add to boiling broth. You can continue to add them even when they cover the top. Just take a spoon and put them down, keep adding as long as you can or want to. you will have to make more than one batch of dough. I usually make 3 batches and use a 6Qt pot. But be careful, they will boil over. When you are done adding dough, turn heat down, and continue to cook until they are shiny. Then they are done. If you want them like a biscuit inside, make bigger pieces to drop in. When you get enough dough, it will thicken itself. I you get it to thick, and more broth, or water. Serve with Cornbread
Chicken and Dumplings#37#3#This was SO yummy. My husband loves chicken and dumplings but I could never find a recipe turned out for me. I did add a little garlic and onion powder and did not use low sodium chicken broth, just for flavor. I also used a rotisserie chicken because my husband likes dark meat better. The dumplings were so good, even the next day for leftovers. Thank you for sharing this recipe - Its a keeper
Chicken and Dumplings#11#0#So simple and delicious! Loved the flavors and how comforting the dish is!
Chicken and Dumplings#23#0#At end of instructions, I felt it necessary to add 2 TBSP of cornstarch mixed in with some cooled broth, in order to make it a little thicker. I also added 1/4 tsp more of the poultry seasoning. The dish is tasty and quick to prepare.
Chicken and Dumplings#7#4#This was very good and my kids loved it. The only thing I changed was I used Italian seasoning instead of poultry seasoning because I don't like sage. 
Chicken and Dumplings#4#10#Loved the flavor of the chicken soup . I did end up thickening it up with instant potatoes. Did not like the dumplings though; ended up fishing them out and dumping them. 
Chicken and Dumplings#4#0#SuperFly Easy & very good! I made it even easier, I think. Cubed 3 small chicken breasts cooked in olive oil & cavenders til done, added the carrots and celery, water, better than boullion. Allowed to cook until veggies were a bit tender then dropped the dumplings on top. My fussy eating daughter liked as well as the rest of the fam.
Chicken and Dumplings#2#6#I made this tonight. SO good. I sauteed fresh broccoli, fresh sliced carrots and chopped celery. I used 2% milk. Also added a shake of garlic powder, some dried parsley and some dried minced onion to the baking mix. Used a little bit more broth than stated. SO good. Will Definitely be making again!!
Chicken and Dumplings#3#3#Reminded us of a chicken version of traditional beef stew. We peeled and cubed one large baking potato and added with the celery and carrots. We also added two bay leaves. The dumplings were a gummy mess but I normally do not have issues with dumplings and think this was just poor execution on my part. The broth did thicken and look creamy from some of the dumpling residue. Will make this again, great for a cold Minnesota dinner.
Chicken and Dumplings#1#0#I made this and it is easy, delicious and a favorite on a cold day.
Chicken and Dumplings#5#0#No Low fat alternative choices if you want REAL fluffy dumplings like your (my) mom made. She made large ones
Chicken and Dumplings#6#2#No, actually dumplings do not ALWAYS have egg in them. Actually, traditional dumplings are baking powder, flower, salt, some type of shortening and a milk product. It is the way the shortening is mixed in that makes them so moist and fluffy. And being steamed on top. This is a good recipe. I made my great-grandmother's traditional dumplings on top though, approved by my boyfriend's brother who is a Master chef. He says dumplings are NOT traditionally made with egg... 
Chicken and Dumplings#1#8#Exple, thanks for the dumpling recipe! I really don't like the ones made with bisquick any more .... and Stewart and Lolygagtx .... you're talking about cooked pie dough and those are the most disappointing, awful dumplings - NOT I've ever tasted. I ordered chicken and dumplings when we went to Cracker Barrel and we have never gone back. Horrible food. A real dumpling is basically a biscuit cooked on top of a stew, just like the recipe states. They are fluffy and delicious and always have egg, baking powder, and milk. Always. 
Chicken and Dumplings#5#0#It amazes me how some think their way is always the only way! I grew up with a southern Georgian Dad and a northern Canadian Mom. The flat dumplings versus drop dumplings fight was settled early. Northern drop dumplings won hands down! Even my soul-food loving Dad admitted the flat dumplings (which were like mushy noodles to me) weren't as tasty as the light fluffy biscuit-y drop dumplings made from scratch! I don't know and it may be good, but Mom never used boxed mixes of anything.
Chicken and Dumplings#3#0#To Stewart...the lumps of dough ARE dumplings.....made Northern style...strips of dough Southern and Amish style....don't like them....don't eat them......real simple to understand. 
Chicken and Dumplings#1#0#These are not Cracker Barrell chicken and du,Pliny's!!!!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Tastes good, family liked it. But the dumplings at the Cracker Barrel's in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Virginia, Georgia , Alabama, Oklahoma, are flat, and not gummy at all.
Chicken and Dumplings#3#3#I've made chicken and dumplings for years! Using dough strips strips is a Southern thing! My mother and Grandmother made dumplings the Northern way - I use typical soup ingredients and when ready my dumplings are: 1 c. flour, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt I add amount of dry parsley to flour mixture, Mix 1 egg, 1/4 c. milk , add to flour mixture and drop by tablespoon - cover and cook on low heat - Note: makes a lot of dumplings and you can add any dry herbs you love (thyme, dill, oregano, basil, or add the cheese packet from mac'n cheese mix!) 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#2#I've made this a couple times and it's on the menu for our frigid weather coming tomorrow. My three year old LOVES it and it is great comfort food. Use a rotisserie chicken for convenience and just shred it. Really easy to make and a family winner!
Chicken and Dumplings#3#3#Love, love, love this recipe. Super easy, and so good. I use a Bisquick cheese garlic mix, and it adds an addictive flavor to this! Great as a dutch oven camping treat on a cold campout. Precook the chicken, and you heave a hearty meal in minutes over the campfire.
Chicken and Dumplings#3#25#Where in the world did a recipe like this come from? Certainly not from the mountains and if it did I would have eaten at your house 1 time and that would have weaned me. Ain't even close to what a dumpling should be. Balls of dough that you called a dumpling ( ugh).for one thing milk does not go in dumplings at all. A good strong broth is the flavoring of a dumpling salt and pepper. A cup or two of cool broth to mix with your flour. Rolled out thin on a floured surface and left for an hour or so. Cut with a pizza cutter in 1x2 pieces and drop into boiling broth and stir gently continuously to keep from sticking. Salt and pepper to taste and you can thicken with a mixture of plain flour and cold water . Add while it's at a gentle boil while stirring. Turn down to simmer. It's very easy to over boil and dumplings will fall apart. Do not put a lid on the dumplings. You can add shredded or cut up chicken if you wish.
Chicken and Dumplings#2#0#I would give this five stars if some seasoning had also been added to the dumpling dough. While the poultry seasoning in the soup is good, it doesn't make up for the lack of seasoning in the dumpling. I will continue to use this recipe, but will do the dumplings a little differently next time. 
Chicken and Dumplings#2#1#Very similar to my MIL's recipe, which I loved! I did use 2% milk (that's what I had), cooked the dumplings 10 minutes uncovered and 10 minutes covered (I THINK that's what she did) and I added a cup of peas (for more veggies). True comfort food! 
Chicken and Dumplings#1#1#Yall just changed my recipe for my chicken and dumplins!
Chicken and Dumplings#1#0#This is wonderful, quick, and delicious. After making it a few times as the recipe says, I've started adding a tsp of poultry seasoning to the biscuit mix. Really good! 
Chicken and Dumplings#1#0#Marion, I would substitute with whole milk also, but the milk goes in the biscuit mix, not the soup
Chicken and Dumplings#2#0#I would definitey substitute the fat free milk with whole milk...to get that rich creamy full bodied gravy.
Chicken and Dumplings#1#0#Our family loves comfort food. Made this in the fall on a cool evening. Was a great dish. Easier to make than alot of other chicken'n dumpling recipes. We used precooked rotisserie chicken and just shredded it. Worked out great! 
Chicken and Dumplings#3#0#This is the chicken and dumplings I grew up with. I don't want those flat, gummy things others call dumplings. Love this recipe. Thanks for sharing. 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#A whole lot easier than the chicken and dumplings my grandmother made. It took me 5 years to get her recipe right. The only difference is I add milk or half and half to the broth after it is done. I prefer the milky broth to the clear.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#2#This recipe looks great but the dumplings at the Cracker Barrel in Tulsa don't look like this--they are flat. 
Chicken and Dumplings#3#0#Very good! The only change I made was to cook the dumplings uncovered over low heat 10 minutes then cover and cook 10 minutes longer as instructions on my biscuit mix instructed. This makes sure the dumplings are done and tender. It also thickens the sauce a bit.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Absolutely delicious and soooo easy! The leftovers thickened up in the fridge, so it was even better the next day. I can't wait to make it again! 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I used frozen mixed veggies. It was good. I think the sauce should be thickened. The dumplings should be flipped when firm so the other side cooks.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Easy and delicious. Will make again.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Made this for the first time....thought there would be leftovers....and not one drop left...big hit with my family..thank you for sharing.... next time I will double the recipe. :)
Chicken and Dumplings#0#1#I haven't tried this recipe yet, I gave it 5 stars, because this is the Chicken and Dumplings I remember as a kid. Not Chicken and Noodles, as so many call Dumplings now. I will be making soon, since we're in the middle of Winter. Thank you for sharing. 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#it was very good, i cut recipe in half as there is only two of us. I wasnt sure what to expect so I was a little surprised to find it as soupy as it was, just thought it would have been a little thicker but still very good 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Fantastic!!! Next time I'll double all but the biscuits so that leftovers don't soak it all up. Loved this! 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Delicious! I added marjoram and parsley to both the liquid and the dumpling dough.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#1#way to much sodium over 1000mgs in a single serving?
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#This is our go to recipe. So good with a pan of cornbread. I know carb overload but soo good!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#5 stars for quick, easy and tasty. I didn't grow up on chicken and dumplings but my husband and kids liked this recipe just fine! 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Really yummy although I couldn't find reduced fat biscuit mix and I used 1% milk since that's what I had on hand. Leftovers were great the day after! 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Excellent!! My husband loved it and he is a picky eater. I added basil and a bay leaf for extra flavor. I will definitely make it again, soon!!
Chicken and Dumplings#2#1#Nothing quite as good as C&D on a cold night in my opinion. Reading the recipe I was really hoping it would be something that would spur a need to make them in a month or two.My taste buds and sense of smell are not what they used to be. I have horrible allergies/asthma. I know that when I cook now I have to do a lot more seasoning so I can have any flavors at all. Unfortunately for me I can't see using an 1/8 t pepper (ever) in any recipe or 1/2 t poultry seasoning either. Still&all appreciate you posting recipe, I'm sure it's very good. 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Very good recipe, added rosemary and a bay leaf for more flavor. I also added a 1/4 cup low fat shredded cheddar cheese to biscuit mix. Yum!Family loved this and will definitely make again!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I have made this numerous times. It's so good & easy! 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Fast and full of flavor
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Quick & Easy! I too cooked for 20 minutes.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#NANCY: Your recipe was quick and definitely delicious. Thanks for your lovely recipe for a delicious & quick dinner after a busy day!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#This was very easy and very tasty. I had always used biscuits cut in fourths for dumplings . These were much better . Followed recipe except didn't add carrots ( personal preference) 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I use thawed frozen mixed veggies instead of the carrots and celery. I have also made it using cream of chicken soup instead of broth. Very rich and easy.
Chicken and Dumplings#1#0#Tired this and making it a lot we love it and it is so tasty and easy to make I added tarragon for extra flavor and makes a difference is so good my husband loves it added tarragon to the dumplings also, you must try this
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#First time I made Dumplings! Turn out Great! Thanks!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Good
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#This is absolutely delicious. I never had luck making chicken and dumplings and gave up a long time ago. I decided to try once again. The dumplings turned out perfect. I left them cook 20 minutes to be on the safe side like some of the others suggested. So glad I did since any time I did make dumplings they were always full of doe in the middle. Husband says I have to make this again, which I definitely will. I also added onions because we are big onion fans. Excellent Recipe and is great in a time cruncher. Thanks for posting
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Super fast and easy way to get a hearty meal on the table. This tastes like it has been simmering all day. I will be making this recipe many, many times. It's a keeper. 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I was in a time crunch last night and remembered I had printed this recipe out, and was glad I did.I am a sucker for biscuits and that was why I wanted something super fast, easy and delishAnother thing you could do to make it even faster is use frozen biscuits.Very nice recipe, will be making this again.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#1#if you can't remove the lid how can you insert a toothpick see when the dumplings are Done???? I am confused 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#This was a big hit with my family easy to fix and taste is great.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#This recipe was loved by my husband and my two picky girls! I used carrot, onions and peas in my recipe.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I had four cups of rotisserie chicken in my freezer that I wanted to make good use of, and this brutal, unending winter makes me yearn for comfort foods. I searched the internet and came across this recipe, which I followed with the exception of the chicken amount. It turned out great! Very filling and satisfying! Definitely a keeper.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Easy and tastey. Perfect comfort food for a chilly night. I like to add additional veggies, whatever I have, sometimes even frozen mixed veggies.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I have made this recipe and one that uses refridgerated biscuits and cream of chicken soup. My children and husband all liked this recipe better. I did not use the vegetables because my kids will not eat their veggies if I put them in a casserole or soup.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I have made the cream of chicken soup version and this one, Minus the vegetables because the kids will only eat veggies separate. I honestly thought they would like the cream of chicken soup better but all three of them and the hubby liked this one much more.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Although my family absolutely loves dumplings, I've NEVER been able to make them. They either end up under-cooked or spread out all over the pan like soup. These worked out perfectly though! Reading through the comments, I went ahead and let them cook 20 minutes without lifting the lid. Then I tested them with a toothpick to check for doneness and they were just right. When I make a new recipe, the big test is whether my family would want me to make it again. I received a resounding YES on this one. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe! 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#This is only the second time I've made this and it is so easy and good. This time, though, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and a 16 oz bag of edamame. 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I make this probably once a month because we love it so much!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I added about 1/3 of a large onion, and some garlic salt(just a pinch.) My sons favorite is chicken and dumplings-he LOVES this recipe! :) Thank you Nancy, for sharing it with us!
Chicken and Dumplings#2#0#I rated this recipe as it was written. First it was pretty bland so I added a small chopped onion, a minced garlic clove, a handfull sliced mushrooms and 1 1/2 T. chicken soup base. Then I made the dumplings and I wondered about the thin consistency but cooked them anyway. They never did cook all the way through. More like dough lumps and the tasted BITTER. I ended up fishing them out and made another batch with 2 c. of bisquick and cooked them as directed on the box, 10 minutes uncovered and another 10 with the lid on. Perfect dumplings although by now the broth had reduced to nothing and I was literally left with chicken and dumplings.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Loved by 4 boys and a Dad!!! Can't believe how good the sauce turned out. So quick too! We could add other veggies next time too. Thanks for a great recipe! 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Love this recipe, really easy. Just needs a little extra flavor for my taste. Added an onion to the veggies and some garlic. Also added some salt and rosemary and parsley. Quick and really good. Might try another reviewers idea and use a rotisserie chicken next time...
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#This recipe turned out to be very, very good. Makes an awesome dinner on cold evenings, will definitely be making this again...soon.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#did not have bisquit mix to make the dumplings but I did have a box of potato dumpling mix so I did a substitute and everyone loved it. Will add more broth next time for a soupier consistency 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#This recipe was super easy to make and really tasty! I did make some modifications...I added on medium diced onion a sprinkling of garlic salt and one heaping tsp. of cornstarch mix into 1/4 c. water.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#So easy to make, and so good !!!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#This was so easy and pretty tasty, especially for a healthier recipe. The family really liked it so I?ll be making it again. Next time I might add some onions and skip the poultry seasoning.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#LOVE this recipe. For Picky eaters & kiddos plus Mommies trying to watch their waistline. FINALLY, one meal for EVERYONE! I used canned chicken and added some ground fresh spinach leaves- getting in the greens is never easy with toddlers.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#This was so incredibly good! My whole family raved about this. We'll definitely be making it again and again. I was surprised at how simple the recipe was to taste sooooo good! I let mine simmer extra long to be sure the dumplings were really done, so it cooked down to a nice chicken stew consistency. I only used 20 oz. of chicken breast, so between less chicken and simmering down quite a bit, I ran short on servings of the actual stew to go with all those dumplings. But other than that, it was perfect! Delicious! 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#1#Very tasty, and so easy! I didn't have carrots, so I thawed some frozen mixed vegetables and added them in with the broth. I also used leftover turkey. I didn't use anything reduced sodium or reduced fat, so it was definitely salty enough. 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I Really like this recipie for its versatility and simplicity. I had never made this dish before, and it was a great starting point.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Very easy to make....hardest part was chopping the veggies! Very tasty, my husband loved it, too!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Very good and SO easy! It did need some salt I thought- I added about 1/2 teaspoon or so. I made a few alternations as well. Instead of canned chicken broth- my Mom makes and freezes it. I put in about 4 cups of broth. I also added one less cup of chicken. Instead of using 1 2/3 cups biscuit mix, I used 2 cups using my Mom's homemade biscuit recipe. This is what I used:2 cups flour, 1 T. baking powder, 1/2 t. salt, 2 T. lard. Mix all ingredients together then add your milk, you may need to add about a tablespoon or so more mix. So easy and quick. It tastes a lot like stuffing.......... 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#My family loved this. I will make this again.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Me and my Family loved it we will surely be making this again 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I really enjoyed this recipe.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#This was delicious and so simple to make. I bought a rotisserie chicken from the deli which gave the recipe some extra flavor. Will definitely be making this again.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I LOVE making this recipe. It is ssoo easy and tastes great. I sometimes make it when taking a meal to someone. It is always so well received.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#This was very good! The broth thickens up as it cools. I cut the recipe in half but made the full amount of dough for dumplings and there were 7 large dumplings for us.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Simple and delicious. I have made this several times over the past couple of years.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#This was great and easy to make!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#My family LOVED it! Definitely making it again!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#First time my chicken and dumplings have came out!!! I used a rotisserie chicken and added the skins to add more flavor, added onion with the celery and carrots,and I also added garlic, because we like garlic and it was wonderful!!1 Everyone said they would like to have it again! Thanks!!!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#This recipe is great and so easy. I ahve neer made chicken and dumplings before, and my husband was a little skepticle. Everyone was plesantly supprised and satisfied after dinner was done.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#It tasted good but needs some alterations. For starters it wasn't very soupy and could use either some water or another can of chicken broth. Good starter recipe that could be great with some improvements. 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#This is very good and easy to make in a hurry. I cook a whole chicken in my crock pot and debone and soup is ready to go in just a short time.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I've tried several times over the years to find a chicken and dumpling recipe like my mother used to make and was always disappointed with the results until I found this recipe. I don't always put vegetables in it but it is delicious either way. Anytime I cook a chicken in the crockpot I always put a single serving of shredded chicken with some broth in the freezer and make a small batch for my lunch when I'm home by myself. 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Yes I would make this again, but I would for sure use the sodium reduced everything, I didn't use sodium reduced broth and it turned out a little salty. But will keep this on my remake list. I made my own dumplings from scratch and every one liked them. I also put in peas, garlic,onion, a bay leaf, and I substituted 2 of the cans of broth to Cream of chicken soup. I will definately make this again. 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#My hubby loved this! I chopped a small onion to saute with the celery and carrots. I also used olive oil instead of coating my dutch oven with cooking spray. Delicious!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I made this recipe last night, using everyone's review suggestions: Adding poultry seasoning, a little salt, etc. I also used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the store to speed the process up. It was absolutely delicious! The only thing, next time I will make the biscuits and not cheat by using a Homestyle refrigerated brand. It's just not the same as homemade. Kids LOVED the meal, too. Big plus! 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I cut the recipe in half and it was very good. The only thing I did different was to add some chopped onion to the vegetables and then cook them for 5 minutes in a little bit of canola oil. I was regretting that I didn't have any cream of chicken soup to thicken the broth but I found it was not needed. The broth was a perfect consistency after the dumplings were cooked. 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I have never made this recipe exactly how it says, but I use it as a guide. I don't add carrots; I use celery and onions. The biggest change I make is using homestyle canned biscuits. I cut each biscuit into thirds and toss in flour, which helps to thicken the soup. My husband's favorite!!! 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Very easy and the whole family loved it. Next time I will try adding some cream of chicken soup to thicken it a little.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I followed all the directions exactly except I cooked the biscuits for 20 minutes and they turned out great. My husband and I loved it very much. This recipe is a keeper!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I have made this recipe several times, and always with rave reviews! It's so easy, and soo good! It's a wonderful comfort food in cold weather. 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Made this the other night and everyone loved it. The perfect comfort food. I read everyones reviews and suggestion it really made a difference. I used some cream of chicken soup which helped with thickness. I also used some onion and also peas. Also, let the dumplings cook extra long. They turned out great. There was so much leftover, I just reheated the next night and made more dumplings. I can't wait to make it for my college daughter to send back with her. 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#The whole family just loved this! The left overs were even better after sitting in the fridge all night. It really thickened up. This is a really quick and easy meal!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#It was really good. The only thing I would change is probably add onions and a little salt with it. But I will definitely make it again.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Everyone at work was sick, so before I caught the cold I wanted to make some hearty chicken soup. I added tons more broth and spices to give the soup an extra kick. I also added egg noodles which turned out great. The dumplings did not come out as planned, but still tasted great, just did not look that appetizing!
Chicken and Dumplings#1#1#I like a lot of veggies in mine, so I added a handful more carrots, one small onion, and a cup of frozen peas. (I stirred in the peas before adding the dumplings, as the other readers did). Since I'm a spice girl, too, I used a rounded 1/2 tsp of the poultry seasoning, and added 1/2 tsp salt, plus a pinch more pepper. Delicious! 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Love love loved this. The definition of quick and easy comfort food!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Very good. I also added some chopped onions and when I added the dumplings I also threw some frozen peas in. I also added 2 red potatoes and loved that. My 2 1/2 year gobbled up an entire bowl and then ate some of my husband's dinner later! 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#this was really easy and good my kids and husband loved it, i DID NOT use reduced chicken broth or fat free milk and biscuit/baking mix it turned out fine, i will be making again!!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#My family loved this recipe!! The only thing I did differently was to season with extra salt and pepper. We will definitely make this again soon!!!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#The dumplings took a little longer than the recipe said, they were very pasty looking, but tasted very good. I subbed corn for carrots ( I didn't have any carrots!) and it turned out really good. Even my picky six year old really like this, I would make it again for sure. 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Another favorite!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#1#I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup plus a large can of broth. I also cut up a couple of small red potatoes (sometimes I used diced hash browns) plus chopped onions. My final addition is once I add the dumplings, I gently stir in a handful of frozen peas. My family requests this recipe often during the winter months.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Made this for my family. They loved it. Had enough left over the next night to serve over biscuits. Would be great served over cooked noodles, too.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Very good. I used leftover turkey instead of the chicken. Regular biscuit mix and salt free all purpose seasoning.
Chicken and Dumplings#1#0#I can't imagine chiken n' dumplings w/o sauteed onions. :-) So I added a chopped onion w/the carrots & celery. Yummy! 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#really good! Everyone loved it. I also put fresh garlic in it.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Kids loved this one. I would add more broth next time though.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#I used regular Bisquick and they turnout out perfect. Maybe skip the poultry seasoning, but mine didn't seem to stick to the dumplings. They were even better as leftovers!!Chefleslie 
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#i use a stock pot instead of a dutch oven and I follow the recipe on the baking mix box for the dumplings. The dumplings have always come out puffy and light! This is a favorite!
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#My dumplings did not rise and they were heavy. As well the poultry seasoning collected on the dumplings, therefore they had a very strong flavour. I used regular Bisquick, as the light counterpart is not available here. Any thoughts?
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#What if you don't own a dutch oven? Can you use a crockpot instead? 
Chicken and Dumplings#1#1#I use a can of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom and use refrigerator biscuits cut into quarters for dumplings. Campfire style chicken and dumplings.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#This has been a great receipe, I only changed one ingredent and that was to add range free chicken broth that is fat free and sodium is low. JP in WY
Chicken and Dumplings#0#1#This is one of my favorite recipes! I make it all the time in the fall/winter. It tastes like it took hours to make, but is very quick. Since I live alone, I usually make half the recipe - which gives me yummy leftovers for lunch the following day.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#wonderful. i will definately make this again.
Chicken and Dumplings#0#0#Easy and good. The dumplings were not gooey Even my picky eater ate some. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Best cookies!! Our new favourites
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#We have made these for many years. It's a great recipe. I use a small cookie scoop and then it makes more cookies. The spice is just right so you can taste it but it's not overwhelming. My young daughter has always said this is her favorite cookie.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Perfect (after adding extra spices)
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#6#5#I have another Ginger cookie recipe that I love but decided to try these from all the reviews. These use less Molasses and smaller amounts of spices so therefore they were flat tasting to me. I use 1/2 cup molasses and 2 t.of spices will return to my old recipe. Also my recipe makes 4 doz. 4 cups flour.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#2#0#I am going to make these amazing cookies tonight for my family. I know that they will love them. I will enjoy them too.??
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#1#So yummy with a cup of tea. Nice and spicy, better the next day.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#6#1#I never write reviews but these are AMAZING. In fact this is the first review I have ever written because I never think it's worth it. But these cookies are worth writing a review for. If you are thinking about making them, DO IT.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#12#3#When I was in middle school, I found this recipe and, subsequently, used to make it every year. When I found out I had a gluten allergy, I had to stop making them (they didn't have good gf flours then). However, this year when planning cookie gifts for Christmas, I remembered these cookies and found this online version of the recipe. I LOVE these cookies and so does anyone who I make them for! This time, to avoid my hands getting so sticky from shaping the balls, I took out about a tablespoon of dough and threw it into my sugar bowl and coated it with sugar and then shaped the ball. This really helped speed up the process and my hands didn't get so messy. Also, I recommend taking the cookies off of the pan almost immediately. With the last pan, I didn't do this immediately and the cookies collapsed slightly. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#0#One of our favourite cookie recipes this time of year. I've been making them for years and they always go over well! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#7#5#i have made a similar cookie for years, but lost my old recipe. These were actually softer than my recipe, which I like. I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup (I reduce the sugar in almost all recipes), increased the flour to 2.5 cups and they came out perfect in texture and sweetness. Next time I would add a bit more spice, but otherwise very good.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#2#1#I made these cookies for the first time today. The flavor is excellent! My cookies came out very flat, though. I think I will try them again and add just a little more flour.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#21#2#Can I freeze this dough to bake later?
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#8#0#I made absolutely zero changes to the recipe. I was tempted at the end to roll the dough balls into raw sugar but I stuck with the granulated.  The resulting cookies are crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, perfectly spiced. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#2#0#This website is great can't wait to find more recipes 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#10#2#The best ginger-molasses cookies I've ever made. I multiplied the measurements by 1.25 and it makes 3 dozen even with my scoop size (which is around 2 tablespoons in size). My dad loves'em and he's not easy to please with cookies! I've made a LOT of fail cookies. They're either too moist and somehow bake up crunchy or doughs that are too dry and flavourless. This has a lot of great flavour and you don't have to be shy about kicking up the flavour. I increased the cinnamon and ginger in this recipe to our tastes and added a teaspoon of vanilla with amazing results. A+ cookies! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#3#1#Wow! This cookie was delicious! Easy to make, soft, didn't stay around but 2 days. This one is a keeper!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#3#0#I was looking for a nice soft ginger cookie and these are perfect. I've used this recipe twice now and they've turned out excellent both times. Highly-recommend these! :) 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#14#0#These cookies are the best cookies and my favorite. I literally make 3 batches a week and they only Last 2 or 3 days!! And I honestly have never written a review on anything in my life. So take that to the bank ??????
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#1#Love these cookies, but for whatever reason mine don't flatten at all. They stay big and round. Everyone else has the opposite issue it seems. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#6#0#Perfect flavor and texture! Strong ginger and molasses flavors. Crispy edges and gooey middles.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#3#Good
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#3#12#Please give high altitude adjustments! Many of us live above 4500 feet! They come out flat! I want big fluffy cookies!! Please give high altitude adjustments for this an all your recipes!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#0#Everyone loved them...AMAZING
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#10#3#This is a great recipe. Like others I increased the spices by using the spice amounts in Tartine's ginger cookies: 4 t. giniger, 1+1/2 t. cloves, 2 t. cinnamon, and 1 t. black pepper. Also 3/4 t. salt and slightly less sugar than a cup. They are incredible and a real keeper recipe I will use again and again. They also ship well 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#2#1#These were fantastic. Like others I could have used more ginger and cinnamon. I followed the directions and creamed the butter and sugar for 5 min and I baked them maybe 15-17 min and they are still really soft. I will be making these again!!Thank you!!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#4#2#This is a good base recipe. But the flavor is a bit flat. If you bake much, the lack of vanilla extract, and the small amount of salt would jump out at you right off the bat. Also, for those having trouble getting them to be thick an chewy, remember that it's virtually impossible to over mix dough until you've added the flour. Get it good and fluffy. Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl several times if you're using a stand mixer. I made the following changes/additions, and the richness of the flavor was extremely popular with friends. 3/4 tsp salt 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp vanilla extract 2 tsp Lebkuchengewurz (German Gingerbread Spice) I use a #40 disher for consistency. My old convection oven would finish them in 12 minutes. My recent one takes 14 minutes. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#4#0#This is a great recipe! The dough formed perfectly for me, it almost felt like playdoh. I didn't have any ground cloves on hand, so I left them out and they taste just fine. They needed and additional 2-ish minutes in the oven, but that's no biggie at all. This is defiantly my new favourite cookie recipe! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#3#1#These cookies are fantastic! I read through the comments before starting and was worried about the issue with the runny batter, spreading cookies, etc., but I proceeded anyway and the dough turned out perfectly and there was absolutely no major spreading in the oven whatsoever! I did follow the tips about creaming the butter and sugar for 5 minutes and also chilled the dough for 20 minutes before scooping and baking. I'm really not sure why some people had such problems with it, maybe their butter was too soft. I will say that for my family's taste, I did need to add additional spice. I added a whole extra teaspoon of the ginger and increased the cinnamon to a full teaspoon and honestly, I could've done with even more, which is why after tasting the test batch I rolled them in a cinnamon sugar/pumpkin pie spice mixture. The texture is exactly what I was looking for: soft and chewy with just a touch of crispiness on the outside. These will absolutely be in my Christmas cookie line up for every year to come. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#2#0#I made these soft ginger cookies and thought they were really good and soft, but have decided I like the crispy old-fashioned version better so will be making those instead. If you like soft cookies, try this recipe.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#My family absolutely loved this recipe. My son told me he doesn't care for gingerbread cookies but he really likes these cookies. Winner! Thanks you!!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#0#Best ginger cookie I've made. Love the soft, chewy texture! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Great chewy crispy texture and perfect ginger flavor!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#0#Very delicious, we loved them! I'll make them again and again! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#0#These are our favorite ginger cookies and I've been making them for years. Family and friends look forward to them every Christmas and I *have* to make them no matter what other cookies I make. I make a few changes to best suit our taste, but nothing that significantly alters the recipe and they come out perfect every time. I use Crisco butter flavored shortening to keep the cookies from flattening out too much; 1/2 C. granulated sugar and 1/2 C. brown sugar; 1 tsp. each ginger and cinnamon, leaving the amount of cloves the same; roll the dough into 1-inch balls to get 48 cookies; and only dip the tops of the dough balls in granulated sugar before baking, finding that adds enough for us. The recipe doubles easily, which is good so we get some for us to enjoy after giving lots away! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#0#My family LOVES these cookies!! They are so soft and delicious!!!!!!!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#3#0#The only problem with these cookies is how fast they were consumed. Delicious.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#1#These cookies were delicious. My entire family enjoyed them. Soft, chewy, and crunchy. This was my first time doing this type of cookie, and it was easier than I thought. I would recommend chilling the dough before rolling. I will use this recipe for gingerbread men! Thank you!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#1#I used 1/4 c of bacon fat With 1/2 c crisco for the butter and increased the ginger. The bacon imparts a slightly smokey flavor which nicely complements the ginger!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#1#It was a chilly September morning so baking was on my list ! The cookies are scrumptious but I didn't feel they had enough ginger so I added about 1 1/2 -2 tsp of Ginger paste that was in my refrigerator ( Aldi find ) I also use thicker coarse colored sugars in a rusty red autumn color. They have the coarse sugar at TJMax or Marshalls far cheaper than anyone. ! I took them out of my convection oven when they were soft and voila the center is soft and the outer edges are crispy! My house is toasty warm with the taste of home so reminiscent of my youth when my Mama was baking up a storm. ????
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#The cookies are wonderful. I used cold butter and mixed it in a stand mixer to soften with the sugar and the cookies did not spread. Just perfect!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#1#I made these cookies this morning and they are just GREAT!! There is no other word for it. The reader that mentioned all the things she did to it and they didn't spread out, I can see why! Just make the recipe, no different flour's, etc. When I make them again I might add a little more ginger is all..... 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#2#I think this recipe is a great starting point for ginger cookies. The ginger flavor isn't super noticeable though, if you, like me, crave the warmth of a strong ginger taste. I've made a couple modifications to make these cookies healthier and tastier while not compromising the softness of the cookies: 1. Replaced half of the flour with ragi flour. Ragi is a finger millet and has high protein, mineral, and fiber content. 2. Reduced butter to 8 tbsp. With the additions below, there is extra moisture in the batter and no need to use as much butter. You could in fact reduce butter further to 7 or 6 tbsp since I found my batter a little sticky and hard to form into balls. 3. Increased ginger to 3 tsp 4. Added half a cup of shredded coconut 5. Added half a cup of flax seed powder I haven't had a problem with the cookies spreading out too thin. In fact I've had the opposite issue of them not spreading out enough. It may have to do with where I am located - even in the summer it's quite chilly. I leave my egg and butter out to let them warm up to room temperature, and use a stand mixer so they get nice and fluffy. I also use molasses which is super sticky, so that may contribute to reducing the spread.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I had no molasses so I used honey and dark brown sugar instead. The flavor of these cookies was good, although I think next time I'll add a little more ginger and a little less sugar. Also, like many other people here, the cookies spread out a lot and became flat once I took them out of the oven. This made them weirdly floppy? I chilled the cookie dough for 30 minutes before forming the cookies and then put them in the fridge again before baking them. Maybe next time I will add more flour or use less butter. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#1#This recipe looks pretty clear to me. I usually chill my cookie dough for10-15 minutes while I preheat the oven. This will keep your cookies from spreading too much. Also, 3/4 tsp isn't an unusual amount. Most bakers have 1/2
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#First attempt at these today a success and I'm no baker! Followed recipe to a T but did sift the flour and dry ingredients together as my ginger and cloves were kinda old. Note: when it says softened butter, I DID NOT microwave the butter. It was just room temp so took awhile before it appeared light and fluffy. In fact I was skeptical about it! Took awhile to achieve light texture and was definitely not fluffy. Proceeded on with the room temperature egg, etc. I did use the hand mixer for adding in the first 1-1/2 cups of the flour mixture but then switched to stirring. Then I made all the balls up. Then I got out a little bowl and put 1/4 cup sugar in as a guesstimate. I rolled the balls in that. It was more than enough. I baked mine 10.5 minutes in a gas oven. Took them out as the cookies cracked and puffed up. They are just perfect. Outside is firm but inside is soft. Best ginger cookie recipe ever!! Hope they will stay soft.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#0#Gave 4 stars because as other reviewers said, the batter was thin so that it was hard to roll the dough. I added 1/4 C more flour and chilled the dough balls for 7 minutes before baking. Still they were very flat after baking. The flavor was excellent however. Loved the spicy taste of the ginger spice blend. When cool, they were slightly crunchy on the outside, and chewy on the inside. Will make again, and try adding more flour to see if I can get them to be a slightly thicker cookie.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Delicious
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#0#@Ashen My dude you just need to take a 1/4 measuring cup/tsp and use it 3 times. These cookies were delicious and didn't give me any problems despite my use of GF all-purpose flour. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These cookies remind me of the ones my grandma used to make. Love how easy they were too man, and they are perfect for dipping in coffee on a cold day!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These are amazing! I've made these 3 times and they spread a bit HOWEVER I accidentally added 2
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Ashen, I think you're new on TOH. Some suggestions for you, kiddo! 1) After you've cooked, baked, etc. for some years, you'll realize that 3/4 measurements are common in recipes, so you're going to have to accept that. Find a 3/4 tsp. measuring spoon., or use 1/2 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#20#Worst recipe ever. Did everything right I even triple checked the recipe and measurements. It came out as a huge gooey glob. Looks disgusting. Also stop using 3/4 measurements. Make a real recipe with real fkg measurements. Despicable.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These cookies are a favorite of my husband's and I've been making them for years. I freeze the dough balls before baking so they don't spread excessively. Sometimes I use dried ginger along with the ground. They're always so soft and don't last long at our house!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#We love these cookies. We didn't have molasses, so we used all brown sugar and added a little corn syrup for liquid. We doubled the amount of ginger. And rolled them in granular baker's sugar so they had yummy crunchy sugar on the outside. They're so good. Everybody LOVES them....especially still slightly warm from the oven.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#5#I'll give 5 stars for flavour, but no way do these cookies deserve a high rating. I followed the recipe exactly....the two inches apart should be been 5! The dough is way too soft and just runs into a big mass of a dough sheet! I reviewed the recipe because I thought I had made an error but no. Sorry but there are much better recipes out there for soft molassses and ginger cookies!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#We opted to make these smaller, using a mini ice cream scoop , which yielded 50 or more. I mixed white and demerara sugar 50-50. Real molasses is hard to find in our part of India, so I used melted palm jaggery. SUPERB recipe. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I love these. The only change I made was making them about 2 inches and so I only got 16 cookies. But I like them big!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#tastes excellent. rich flavor from the cinnamon' cloves and ginger combination 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Great recipe. My family loves them. I keep seeing comments on the sugar amount, it's 1 cup of sugar for the cookies. The additional sugar is to roll the cookies in once you have them formed into the ball. I put mine in a Tupperware container, place one cookie at a time in it roll it around to cover the cookie, then I place the cookie on a cookie sheet and bake. The amount of sugar changes depending on how big or how many cookies I make. I believe that's why there's no amount for it. I usually start with a cup and go from there. Best of luck. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Fantastic- I added a tiny bit more sugar- they are so so so so good. A little kick to them, very rich, but delicious.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These are absolutely perfect! My family are not huge on fall spices, so the amount in the recipe in each are just good enough. Love the texture, the flavor and easy to follow! This recipe is a keeper!!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#5#Additional SUGAR RAW is not an ingredient one can act on. Recipe does not say how much sugar and the multiple adds for PRINT RECIPES is so annoying. By accident I clicked on it and then had to spend time to take it out. I just signed up for this site, as I saw the recipe on my FLIPBOARD page, but due to the navigation around ad challenges and inability to get accurate recipe ingredients, I am seriously considering deleting my account. Frustration is not a customer service plus.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These were great! I took one reviewer's advice and used 1 cup of sugar and they came out wonderful. I had to bump up my time a bit but I think it's because I made them a bit too big lol 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These have been a favorite since I stumbled across this recipe last fall but at some point the amount of sugar needed dissapeared! I used 1 cup of granulated sugar and the cookies turned out just as they always have, perfect and delicious!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I don't see the sugar amount? 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#How much sugar does this recipe take?
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#0#Excellent recipe!! My husband loves cookies with ginger and molasses and these were a huge hit. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. Watch the cooking time closely. I took them out of the oven after 11 minutes. I was concerned they may not be fully done but they were perfect!! They've stayed nice and soft. Definitely added this to my favorite recipes. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#So good! I prefer more spice flavor so I add more ginger and cinnamon. Do watch the baking time, I try to take them out just before they appear done, for that chewy, soft texture, once cooled and set. These are a classic around the holidays but they are also a great summer picnic cookie, with a glass of lemonade!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#0#Made these for my 2 sons. They loved them and ask me to make them for their offices. Now if I ask them and my husband what kind of cookies they want, it is always these. Their office mates even request them. Definitely, a winner.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Seriously? Can only see the first 4 ingredients because of a stupid ad!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#1#How ridiculous. Your sponsored ingredient eggs put an ad you can't close over half the ingredients! So thanks for that, I would have loved to make these. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#1#Got started making this and realized most the ingredients covered by an add
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#It would be nice to see the entire recipe, not just butter eggs sugar and molasses...
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Is there anything I need to do differently for high altitude? These were awesome to start but didn't know if I need to alter the recipe for living in Denver Colorado?
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#1#Oh my. This cookie was just what was needed on this cold rainy day. I was unexpectedly out of regular sugar and so used Demerara for both the actual cookie and for rolling. The cookies had that bit of crunch from the sugar and were heavenly. I am not sure I will ever make them any other way now. Thank you.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#The ease of the recipe was great, and having all ingredients, but one, in the house made it enjoyable to make. The cookies looked exactly like the cookies in the video. The texture was spot on: crunchy outside and gooey inside.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I have made this cookie just as the recipe says and it turns out perfect every time. This is my husband's favorite cookie. I always double it each time I make it. I do not flatten the cookie balls at all. I bake for 10 minutes and leave on the cookie sheet about two minutes after taking them out of the oven. They look just as the picture shows and taste fantastic. I highly recommend this recipe.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Love this I had to make a second batch because my family ate them all and I had none left over to give away. The first time I made them the dough was dry, but I think that's because I had to place it in the frige to step out, the 2nd time it wasn't dry but both time absolutely delicious it's going to be one of my go to cookie recipes 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I made an account on here just to rate these cookies 5 star. They were easy to make and came out perfectly. I've never made ginger snap cookies before but they came out incredible, could recommend this to everyone!!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I'm a professional baker and this is the best soft ginger cookie recipe I've ever tried. I followed the recipe exactly. I tried, like some others suggested, to flatten the cookies a bit before baking, but I got better results by NOT flattening like the recipe says. I used a 1 oz. cookie scoop to portion out, roll in sugar, and bake as instructed. They came out perfectly. Highly recommend this recipe. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I made these one night; they didn't last long and I was asked to make another DOUBLE batch! Just the recipe I've been looking for... crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside. First time I made them, I rolled them in white sugar, as directed in the recipe. When I made the double batch, I rolled half of them in white and half in brown sugar... OMG... tastes like a'creme brulee' topping! Great recipe, Barbara! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#What I love about these cookies is the buttery flavor. I do like ginger snaps, so I halved the baking soda, and they turned out perfect! Also used granulated cane sugar on the bottom of a juice glass to flatten them just a bit before baking. Could not be happier with results. Thank you, TOH!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These are good. Recipe produced a really stiff dough, for me anyway -- wish I'd started stirring the dry ingredients earlier (stand mixer was not happy). And, I'm with those who suggested to flatten at least a bit (mine didn't flatten as they cooled). My mom had a recipe, who knows where it came from, called Super Ginger Snaps. A soft-type drop cookie but more strongly spiced. Still my favorites! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I made these exactly as the recipe was written. The flavor was great but they came out flatter and crispier then they looked in the picture. My oven temp is fine. When they came out of the oven they looked like the picture but as they cooled they flattened. How can I get a thicker, lighter cookie?
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#0#The recipe caught my eye at Soft and Ginger. The reviews that read chewy, easy and Ginger Snap flavor convinced me it would be worth the effort. Used the exact ingredients/amounts, and a 1 1l2 cookie scoop; lightly pressed each dough mound with a heavy flat-bottom drinking glass, dipped in sugar. RESULTS: crackled top, soft, chewy and Ginger Snap flavored perfection. Shared the first batch with my taste test field specialists; a.k.a. family members-huge hit. Made a second batch (altering nothing) the very next day; same great results. Can't perfect, perfection! This will be another family favorite added to my Taste of Home collection! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These cookies are ama ZING!! My Mother gave me this recipe years ago,, always a hit. Perfect for a cold fall day, the house smells like Thanksgiving.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Made these and they are more of a ginger snap taste than a gingerbread but that was fine with us! Very easy. 2nd batch seemed a little dry to roll but added a little more butter and it came out easier to roll. Definitely will make again!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Made them and they came out flat. Any ideas why?
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Made these today,turned out great!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#0#I work at a cafe that makes fresh pastries and desserts and when looking for recipes I settle for absolutely nothing less than the best. I have a very high standard and I was skeptical. But these were wonderful cookies and I admit that I ate them for dinner and then for breakfast the next day. I couldn't keep my paws off of them! They are not big like the recipe says but pressing down on them before baking does help a lot. These will definitely be going in my lineup at the cafe! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#this is the third time i've made this recipe, i make it just like instructed and it's perfect, better than coffee shop cookies. i tend to refridgerate cookie dough for 5-10 mins before i bake. make sure to press down on the cookies slightly so it cooks evenly. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Excellent recipe! Definitely will be making these cookies again.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#In nature, light creates the color. In the picture, color creates the light. Your Recipes are just awesome. Keep up the good work!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#0#5 stars. I have made over a dozen 5 star recipes, but this one was PERFECT. I used what I had in the kitchen, vegan butter and flax eggs. It was still delicious! I also ran out of sugar and rolled the cookie balls into powered sugar. Can someone say cracked out! Our pleasure sensors went nuts after a bite.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#0#I seriously think these cookies are just about the best I've ever tasted! I made them for my pregnant daughter-in-law (because of the ginger) but loved them so much I intend to make another batch today! By the way, I followed the recipe exactly; didn't change or add anything. Perfect!! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These are perfect! Followed the recipe, I wouldn't change a thing
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Excellent! Followed instructions exactly and made 32, finished size 2 1/2 , not all that big but perfect size. I have one of those old Cushionaire cookie sheets (think that is what they are called) that always makes perfect cookies every time - never burnt. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Very good. Made 30 cookies but they are NOT large. I would call them average to small.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#This is perfect!!! The only thing I changed it double the ginger and used all spice insted of cloves. Ourfriends kept saying This is a perfect taste to make a gingerbread house with. AOH and we rolled them in colored sugar insted of white sugar and he kids went crazy for them!!!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#FANTASTIC! Quick & easy to make. Delicious cookies! Followed recipe exactly, except that I used Big Brown Demerara Sugar Crystals for the additional sugar to roll them in. It has a nice, strong flavor! And, it looks pretty. Dough was just right. Cookies are Soft. Chewy. Delicious. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Followed the recipe. Resulting dough was too slimy and runny. Added 1/2 cup more flour to thicken the dough. Helped to shape them and get them on the baking sheet. Cooked for 10 minutes on 350 as directed. When I took them out of the oven 70% of them had burned on the bottom. They also look nothing like the picture. At least the part of the cookies that were not burned taste good, I guess.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These ar the best gingerbread cookie. I didn't have any cloves, so I used nutmeg. And I also added a little more molasses, and let them cool in the refrigerator. They did not spread, they came out perfect. This is my go to gingerbread cookie recipe from now on.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Fantastic fresh out of the oven with milk. Also, my house now smells delightful.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Added a little more molasses, and added some nutmeg. Perfect!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These are super tasty and wonderfully soft!I chilled the dough for half an hour before baking and they did not spread at all. I think they need a little nutmeg, but otherwise they taste great!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Soft and chewy ! Our office staff loved them!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Great flavor. Soft and chewy
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These cookies are so yummy!! The aroma throughout the house while they are baking is wonderful!!!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I tried this recipe yesterday and was quite pleased with the results. Soft, chewy and delicious. I made a couple of changes. I used 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I didn't have any cloves so used nutmeg instead. I also added a bag of Cinnamon chips. I used a 1 1/2 inch scoop rather than making the balls. Less mess and the cookies are uniform in size.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#My husband is a ginger snap-aholic and is forever bugging me to make them just like (his) mom. I just made a batch of these, and they came out big and soft and chewy, and pretty darn close to what my husband is used to! Can't wait until he comes home to try them!! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Phenomenal recipe. After reading other baker's reviews I increased my ginger to 1.5 tablespoons and increased cinnamon to 1 tsp. Fearing a spread I added 1/4 cup oat flour for chewiness and spread prevention. Bingo!!!Perfection! Thank you fellow bakers for the helpful tips. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I've made this recipe twice. Both times the directions and cook time came out perfect. The second time I added 2 tablespoons of ground ginger opposed to 2tsp because I really love Ginger. I felt that the first batch had too much of the clove flavor and not enough of the ginger. I used Wakaya pink Fijian ginger which is a high impact ginger, mainly to add a more healthy twist on this delicious recipe. I did not change the amount of cloves. This is now quite possibly the best tasting cookie I've ever had. My wife is a big Baker and she thinks that they're possibly the best cookie she's ever had. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Great cookies! A tip: they are best after 2 or 3 days (you'll have to hide them though!) 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I wouldn't give it 5 stars as is, but they are pretty good. The key to getting these to stay soft is to not over bake them (which is very easy to do) 10-12 min max. You almost have to take them out before they look totally done. Also, for those who had issues with spreading, it's likely also because of the use of only butter in the recipe. Butter makes cookies flatter. I used half butter, half butter butter flavored crisco and that did seem to help. I think next time though I would use all crisco though. I also nearly doubled the spices, I tasted the dough first and it just didn't have that ginger taste I was going for so I adjusted. Instead of rolling in sugar, I used a hard cookie glaze and dribbled it over them-- came out pretty great! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These are sooo good. It's hard to resist them after baking too as the house smells wonderful. I stored mine in an airtight container and they remained soft. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#My new favorite ginger cookies! I followed the recipe as written. I have made them 3 times in the last week, doubling the recipe the 3rd time. I have given some away in a treat bag for a small thank you and a little Christmas treat.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I followed the recipe and it turned out excellent. I think I added 1/4 tsp all spice.. The texture of the cookie is the real star--soft and chewy, not cakey (and still is a week later)! They are not too sweet, which I also love and they baked so perfectly, they look like I bought them. the prominent flavor is the molasses to me and the next time I make them I might have a little fun experimenting with a little cocoa in the batter or some cinnamon in the rolling sugar.. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These are absolutely delicious. Perfect for the flavor of gingersnaps without the crunch. I have made these several times and they are always delightful. The first time I made these I worried that the dough seemed too wet, but I learned to just be gentle when rolling and sugaring and they turn out beautifully. I find they always need more like 15 minutes to get to the proper doneness. These are a holiday favorite in my home!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I was super excited to make big fluffy ginger cookies. I bought new ingredients. Sorry to say these cookies turned out flat, just like the crunchier ones I've made. They were softer, but the flavor lacked the prominate ginger taste. I'll go back to my old recipe next time, as they had a better flavor. Sandy in Spokane wa 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I live in a high altitude state and didn't know if I needed to adjust the recipe, but I made as printed and they turned out so good! Perfect ginger cookie. They have a little crunch from the sugar on the outside, but soft and chewy on the inside. I will be making these again! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#This recipe for Big Soft Ginger Cookies is wonderful. Easy to make. Tastes like the holidays to me!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#This recipe is excellent! I added 2 teaspoons of finely chopped crystalized ginger for extra gingery goodness! This will be a family favorite!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Perfect molasses ginger cookie! My grandmother and my mother always ate their molasses cookies with peanut butter spread on top.................delicious!! Try it.........it really is soooo good, especially on this soft and chewy cookie version.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I just made these following the recipe exactly and they came out very thin, not at all like the picture. Maybe refrigerate the dough next time ??
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I've been making these for 20 years. Always perfectly round, always an asked-for recipe. They are fantastic 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#1#0#This is one of our favorites, and I make them all year, not just in the fall or Christmas. I love the deep crevices in the tops. Sometimes I sandwich marshmallow creme between two and make sandwiches!!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#This was amazing. My dad is extremely picky but he loves these! My only question would be if I could make them gluten free? Thanks!!! AMAZING COOKIES
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These are good. I made them this year and last to give out to my neighbors for Christmas. :) My husband really enjoyed them.I did have a problem though, they came out puffy instead of chewy like I was hoping. Any idea why this would happen? What did I do wrong? Thanks.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These cookies are wonderful!! I've used this recipe dozens of times, following it exactly, and I always get tons of compliments and requests for the recipe. The outsides are a tiny crunchy, the middle is soft, and the spices are perfect! I wouldn't change a thing! This is my go to recipe for ginger molasses cookies. I just whipped up a batch and am now going to go enjoy one... or more : ) 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#As an earlier reviewer suggested, I swapped white sugar for brown sugar, and increased the amount of spices. In a word: yum! Just the right amount of spice without being too overpowering, and I did roll mine in white sugar for that nice crackle effect. I would suggest rolling them to at least 1 1/2 balls (or more a pinch more); otherwise; they will poof instead of flatten out. Bake at 10 minutes, tops! I made a double batch yesterday and just finished a second double batch today. These are great holiday cookies (any time of year, really!), and this will definitely be my go-to recipe in the future! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These cookies are SO good. I rolled them in Raw Sugar before baking They turned out so yummy, soft, with sparkly sugar which added a nice crunch with each bite. Yes, yes yes, I will bake these time and time again.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#My daughter needed to bring a small batch of cookies to something she had going on at school, and she'd fallen in love with molasses cookies when she helped her friend bake a batch at the friend's house earlier this year. My mom never made molasses cookies or gingersnaps much, probably because my dad didn't care for them. He preferred peanut butter or chocolate chip cookies (which I still make for him, now that my mom has passed away). So I did a search on the TOH website and came up with this recipe. Read the reviews and added a couple of tbsp. of chopped crystallized ginger to the dough, but otherwise made it exactly as written. The cookies turned out fabulously. My daughter's classmates and teachers hoovered them up and she received three requests for the recipe. The cookies are soft, but that coating of granulated sugar makes for a nice thin crisp glaze. We will definitely be making these again. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Now, I will begin by saying I probably would have rated this a 4 Star had I not increased the spice measurements. I LOVE a robust, full of deep flavour ginger cookie and each time I have tried a recipe (I have tried about 3, I have ALWAYS regretted not adding more of the spices). The alteration I made was: 3 tsp Ginger (instead of 2 tsp), 1 tsp Cloves (instead of 1/2 tsp) and 1.5 tsp Cinnamon (instead of 3/4 tsp). Also, as per previous reviews, I used 3/4 Cup Brown Sugar (Instead of 1 Cup White sugar). I also added in 1/3 cup molasses instead of the 1/4 cup!These where phenomenal!! nice and THICK, just like I was hoping for. Countless recipes before yielded thin, weightless cookies, that lacked in depth of flavour. Whereas these are thick, hearty and chewy. If you liked a fuller spiced cookie I would definitely recommend adding in the extra. I also didn't miss the added sugar because they were rolled in it anyway ;) 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I'm generally not a huge ginger cookie fan, but I was looking for something new to bring to a friends house. These were just amazing! The ginger flavor is not at all overwhelming, and the texture is exactly what I look for in a cookie. CHEWY! This is a keeper. I froze half the batch and they freeze very well. Still have the same chewy texture. I think these would be a good cookie to send to someone if you needed something that would hold up and stay fresh over the delivery time. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#WOW!! Incredible Spice Flavor! Chewy on the Inside! Highly Addictive! ALL UNDERSTATEMENTS! We made these cookies 12 times during the 2014 Holidays!! ????My Lessons..Do Not Over Bake! (8 mins in my convection oven) Do Not Press the Cookie Dough Balls Down BeforeCooking UNLESS Crunchy Hot Cocoa Dunkersare what you're craving!! Either way this cookierecipe is a keeper!! ?? 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Wonderful recipe! I always use brown sugar in place of white sugar and butter flavored crisco instead of butter in my cookies.. Turned out PERFECT!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#excellent; I did add some candied ginger....about 2 tbs. but they are great just the way they are
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Perfect amount of spice. Made a double recipe. Your house will smell like the Holidays ??
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Love these cookies!!! I will be making them every year for the Holidays!!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These are soft and delicious. Very easy to make. Will definitely make again!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These cookies are soft and delicious. A couple of them made it to day 2 and still soft! I also increased the cinnamon to 1tsp. and flattened before baking & got about 2 dz. per batch. Will be making more of these!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#You will not regret making these
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These are lovely cookies. I used a 1 1/2 inch cookie scoop. It made a 3 inch cookie, so if you want something bigger-change accourdingly. It made 35 cookies. I baked till just lightly browned on the edges. I let cool 2 min on pan before removing to racks to cool.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#My Family Loves Loves Lives TheseCookies! EasY And Wonderful.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#This recipe makes perfect ginger cookies. I used a medium Oxo cookie scoop and got exactly 2 dozen cookies. After taking the cookies out of the oven, I pressed each cookie down with the bottom of a glass to make them less puffy and give them more cracks. I needed flat cookies because I used these to make pumpkin ice cream sandwiches.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These are absolutely the best ginger cookies ever! And my father just goes crazy over them! (:
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#This year, I was trying to opt for soft gingerbread cookies, as my son just had his braces put on and can't have anything too crunchy-and what would ruin the holiday mood than biting into one of your favorite cookies and damaging your braces/teeth?! I found this recipe and wanted to try it...WOW! We JUST finished baking these for the first time about 20 minutes ago and my family is already hooked! What a great recipe! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These are great! Easy to make and perfect served warm with a cold glass of milk. Perfect for the holidays.....the spices really set the mood for the coming cold weather.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I have made this recipe at least a dozen times and the cookies come out perfect every time. The only change I make is to use 1 full teaspoon of cinnamon. My family and co-worker love them and request them often. Also, they are so simple to make!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#The cookies were delicious, soft and full of flavor. Both my husband and I loved them. The only reason I didn't give the recipe five stars is because it says this recipe should make 2 1/2 dozen but I made it too the letter (1 1/2 balls for the dough) and it only made 19 cookies. I would double the recipe. 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Great recipe, our new favorite!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Just made these for the first time and they are AMAZING!!!! I will be making tons more for christmas for sure!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#This recipe is super easy and they are delicious!! They even turned out just like the picture (which doesn't always happen!) My son and husband LOVED these cookies so will definitely be making them again soon!! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Last Christmas starting December first, my family and I decided that we wanted to make a different kind of cookie every day for the whole month of December. Well, we needed cookie recipes so I decided to look on tasteofhome, and stumbled upon this recipe. We absolutely love these cookies, they are amazing, the molasses and ginger blend very well together and just like the title, they are big and soft! We make these all the time, my brother had some friends over and said that they wanted cookies so I decided to make these for them, and they ate the WHOLE batch! One his friends said that they were the best cookies he ever tried. Would definitely recommend making these cookies for any occasion. Happy Baking!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#The only Ginger Cookie recipe I make!!!! It is fail proof and they ALWAYS turn out the same:)
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Delicious! I made the cookies a little smaller than the recipe said and cooked them for about 9 mins. Made 48 cookies... smaller ones are perfect as a snack or to give with a thank you note. The smaller ones are a tad bit crunchier on the outside, but still have a soft center.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#A WONDERFUL cookie recipe!!!!!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I make this same recipe , except I use 1 cup of packed light brown sugar. A family favorite.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These are outstanding in flavor and texture! A wonderful soft ginger cookie. I will definitely be making these again.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#made them again today, for husband and I....I added in some ground black pepper...YUMMY!!! and they came out just like the recipe says...soft....
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#love the taste but my cookies came out flatand chewy hard to get off pan it did not come out like the picture can any one help?janeupton21@metrocast.net
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#very good!!!!!!!! daughter didn't have cloves....so didn't add that....I doubled the batch so I can freeze half the dough for her to use later.....YUMMY!!!!! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Just made this and they are DELICIOUS! A definate keeper.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#The best ginger cookies I have ever had or baked. These are delicious!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#these cookies are so good!!!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Love these cookies..ty
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#I have been making these for years. They are wonderful!
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Big Soft Ginger Cookies says it all. I decided to dip them in white chocolate after they cooled. They are wonderful. I will be adding them to my Christmas Cookies this year. Very Pretty
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Easy and delicious. I rolled mine in raw sugar and it made them look nice and gave them a little sugary crunch.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#Delicious. Would definitely make again!! I added raisins, about 1/2 cup and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. Worked very well.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#My first''soft'' gingersnap and what a success. the whole family love them ! 
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These are wonderful.
Big Soft Ginger Cookies#0#0#These cookies are wonderful! I usually make the crisp gingersnaps but these are a great soft ginger cookie.
Creamy Coleslaw#3#0#Made this for a cookout. My husband asked for it twice within the week after the cookout. Great old tyme flavor. Also makes a great dip for veggies and crackers. I didn't have celery salt so I very finely minced a celery stalk and that was great. A little extra crunch with a lot extra flavor! 
Creamy Coleslaw#5#1#The recipe won't print. Had another of your recipes do it last week. Please fugure out what's wrong. 
Creamy Coleslaw#2#2#Super duper easy. I used a bag of broccoli slaw. And instead of ground mustard used whole mustard seed old fashioned mustard. Winner for sure !
Creamy Coleslaw#4#0#This is my go to recipe for coleslaw!! I have used different vinegars in this recipe but I agree with Susan, Tarragon is the best!! 
Creamy Coleslaw#5#5#I made this for a cookout and I'm glad I doubled the recipe. The only thing I did different from the original recipe was added Tarragon Vinegar. If you have never tried it, you should! I loved the flavor! It's a bit sweet, so you can definitely cut that down the sugar if you wish. If doubling, I would also start with a cup of Heinz Mayo and add more later if it needs it.
Creamy Coleslaw#7#0#I go to this recipe all the time. I will say that I add 2 T. cider vinegar to the ingredient list. I keep it in a pint in refrig so I have it on hand when I want to mix up a small Batch for the 2 of us. Yummy!!
Creamy Coleslaw#7#0#Love this recipe. It is sweet, creamy, a touch of tart, and oh so good. I always follow the recipe the first time and then tweak for my taste if need be. I added 1/2 tsp. celery seed in addition to the original ingredients for the second batch. I have made it numerous times since and it tastes just as good with or without the added seed. It is a KEEPER!!!
Creamy Coleslaw#11#11#This is really good as is, but I did make a couple of tweaks to suit my palate the second time around. Now I use a package and a half of cole slaw mix; I think it's too wet otherwise. I reduce the sugar to 2 tbls and add 1 tbls vinegar and a little green onion. I didn't have celery salt the first time I made it, so I used 3/4 tsp celery seed and increased the seasoned salt to 1 tsp. It worked out well, so that's what I continue to do. I'll certainly never buy that jarred slaw dressing again; this is so simple to make and infinitely better. 
Creamy Coleslaw#15#4#Loved this recipe. I added a small chopped red onion and celery seed as I didn't have celery salt. I will reduce the sugar next time as I personally found it'too sweet', but the rest of my family loved it. 
Creamy Coleslaw#21#9#I shredded my own cabbage and added Carrots and Sweet onion. I tasted the recipe before I added the mustard or celery seed and it was just the type of dressing I have been looking for to reproduce the coleslaw of one of my favorite restaurant's so I omitted those ingredients. Very tasty. 
Creamy Coleslaw#11#2#Left out seasoning salt and added 1 T, celery seed and then regular salt in place of the celery salt. I loved the creaminess and slight tang the sour cream gave it. I've never put sour cream in coleslaw and it was so yummy. Very simple but yet tasty recipe. 
Creamy Coleslaw#30#2#My husband and I both love this recipe but I leave out the sugar and use Stevia instead (one pack for us). And I disagree with the comment about it not being good for leftovers. We think it's even better the day after. 
Creamy Coleslaw#1#3#Lovely will try to have it cream looks yummy also the ingredients thanks for recipe.
Creamy Coleslaw#5#1#Absolutely a wonderful recipe that I have searched for so many years. The only alteration that we prefer in the mixture is the addition of 1-1 1/2 tsp. fresh ground horseradish. Makes great even better!
Creamy Coleslaw#1#0#This is my go to recipes. Yummy. Delicious. Will make it again
Creamy Coleslaw#0#2#yum, yum, yummy! Although this is not great as a left-over so I would recommend figuring out how much your family will eat in one setting and adjusting amounts accordingly. Also, I only had red cabbage ready in the garden so I used that. Thanks for sharing!
Creamy Coleslaw#1#6#Sounds good, the ground mustard & celery salt sound interesting, might have to give this a try. We have used a KFC clone for years & you would be very hard pressed to tell the difference between it & the real thing.
Creamy Coleslaw#23#1#How can someone rate 1 star when they're lactose intolerant and can't fix the recipe? Anyway...Love this recipe! Thank you for the submission! And I did sneak a little granny smith apple in as one of the Kitchen Tips and everyone LOVED it! 
Creamy Coleslaw#1#0#Tasted this in a restaurant years ago, this is the closest to that recipe I have ever had , it is wonderful.
Creamy Coleslaw#8#1#I used this recipe exactly as is and we loved this side dish for the 4th of July Stay-at-Home celebration. I bought pre-packaged cabbage/carrot mix but this homemade coleslaw dressing really put it over the top. I will definitely make this a summer family staple dish.
Creamy Coleslaw#9#5#Didn't bonniesunshine read that a store bought bag of Cole slaw was used? It usually has carrots in it! 
Creamy Coleslaw#6#1#This was just to sweet for my taste and I only added a Tbsp of sugar. Started over and deleted the sugar and added lime juice for some tang. It tasted great after those adjustments.
Creamy Coleslaw#1#12#Odd. Pic shows carrots but not mentioned in recipe ingredients?
Creamy Coleslaw#1#1#Love this recipe so quick easy and yummy. I don't like my coleslaw sweet or tart so followed the recipe and added tomatoes!
Creamy Coleslaw#2#1#I omitted the mustard and used apple cider vinegar for tartness. I also used regular salt and added a little black pepper and diced green onion. This is pretty darn good dressing. The sour cream makes it really creamy and keeps it from being too sweet. I will absolutely make it again. Thanks for sharing it!
Creamy Coleslaw#1#0#Try using tarragon vinegar for an even better twist! The apples add crunch and flavor; thanks for suggesting it!
Creamy Coleslaw#1#1#This is the only coleslaw recipe that I use. Sometimes I also add onions.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#69#Has dairy. My family are lactose intolerant.
Creamy Coleslaw#7#1#Loved this but a little too sweet, added Apple cider vinegar and it came out great ??
Creamy Coleslaw#3#0#Delicious!!! I've been looking for a great coleslaw recipe and this is it!! Thank you!! I only had brown sugar and did add a tbls apple cider vinegar. 
Creamy Coleslaw#1#0#So easy to make and so tasty
Creamy Coleslaw#2#0#We loved this coleslaw! I usually buy the jar coleslaw mixer and I will never buy again! This was easy and yummy! Thank you for sharing!!!!
Creamy Coleslaw#3#0#Good recipe but use half or no sugar. The first time I made it with the sugar the second time with half the sugar. Still a good recipe with less sugar.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#3#Needs more flavor. Next time I would add finely diced green pepper and sliced green onions. Also, red wine vinegar in the dressing. A tsp or 2.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#2#I make a similar coleslaw, but I like to add fruit. I add pineapple tidbits, cut mandarine oranges and dried cranberries, have even added diced Granny Smith apples. I like things sweet rather than savory and this fruit addition adds the sweet I crave.
Creamy Coleslaw#3#0#I usually don't use sour cream in my slaw, bu this came out fantastic! I shredded a third of a head of cabbage, two big carrots and half an onion through the food processor. Outstanding! Ed
Creamy Coleslaw#5#0#I have mode this about 5 times now always to rave reviews. It yields a very wet coleslaw so I'll sometomes back off a bit on the mayo part. I too have always added a tablespoon or so of vinegar.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Easy and delicious cole slaw! After reading the reviews, I decided to half the recipe for one 14 ounce bag of cole slaw. I also added a bit of cider vinegar. Perfect side dish for a summer barbecue!
Creamy Coleslaw#0#1#This is my go-to coleslaw recipe. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I always add some cider vinegar to perfect the dressing.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#The best creamy coleslaw that I have found. It reminds me of the coleslaw we get from the famous fried chicken place.
Creamy Coleslaw#1#0#Delicious! I love the flavor the seasoned salt, dry mustard, and celery salt give it. I've used normal coleslaw mix and broccoli slaw. I've also halved the sugar. It's all been good. The only reason I give 4 stars is because it needs a splash of vinegar (I use apple cider vinegar). It also is too much dressing. I either double the slaw mix or halve the dressing. That being said, this is the only coleslaw recipe I make! No need for any other. 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Very Good, I did not use the coleslaw mix because I had fresh cabbage from the garden. I really enjoyed the dressing but next time I will add some fresh lemon juice. I will definitely make this recipe again.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Very creamy and delicious, next time I would add a little vinegar just to give it a little added zing, but that is just my personal preference.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Just made this and put it in the fridge for supper. Delicious!! I did add the white vinegar. Thanks for a great recipe!
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This was amazing. Loved it!!! Nice and creamy. Definitely making this again. Thank you
Creamy Coleslaw#11#0#Love this recipe!!! So did most others, I'd consider that a success!! And to DAVE...I don't think buying a bag of coleslaw mix constitutes a lack of originality, just a plain time-saving move. What you add to it makes it your recipe. 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I have made this several times and it is perfect. I add a little white vinegar.
Creamy Coleslaw#1#37#1 package (14 ounces) coleslaw mix?This goes the same for people who use canned soups in recipes...If you lack the originality to think up your own recipe thenPlease Don't Post! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Made this for a Super Bowl party and it was indeed SUPER! Creamy and delicious. I added a tablespoon of cider vinegar as others recommended, and was very impressed by the creamy, delicious flavor. I'll never need another cold slaw recipe!
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This is really good. Only change I made was celery seed instead of celery salt....because I didn't have any. I did add some more shredded carrots for color and was able to use 2 bags of slaw. Added the second bag after salad sat overnight in the refrigerator and dressing had relaxed a little. Yummy 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I agree with Christine ... picnic and folks will rip the bowl out of your hands.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#3#I am definitely in the minority here. I really, really disliked this recipe. I made it exactly as stated using a bag of angel hair cabbage . It was so wet I added a second bag and it was still too wet. It was so sweet I added THREE tablespoons of horseradish and could barely tell I added any. I gave up and took it to a gathering with a sprinkling of smoky paprika on top. Very little of it was eaten. It continued to get more watery with standing and looked less and less appealing. 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Scrumptious! And so easy! Didn't change a thing except for doubling recipe. 
Creamy Coleslaw#2#0#Yummy and so easy. Will make it again and again.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Very Good and very creamy! I added the 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar as was recommended below and it was really good, but be sure to taste and adjust to your tastes. I will make this again!
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Made this tonight and added 2 tablespoons cider vinegar. Love it!!! My new favorite.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Five star when I added about 2 tbs cider vinegar.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Super quick and easy. Makes cole slaw interesting and zippy. I did not have any sour cream and used just mayonnaise and it was still good
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Creamy indeed. I love the slightly sharp edge that the Sour cream adds to this recipe. It seems to lighten up the heaviness that Mayonnaise can sometimes add to a recipe. Due to health issues I did not use any salt at all. I used Celery Seed, and I cut back on the sugar. And to liven it up even more some Cider Vinegar. Some freshly grinded Black Pepper completes this tasty side dish. One of our favorites during the summer. I know my family is really going to enjoy this one. Its a keeper.JanieTaste of Home Volunteer Field Editor
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#what is ground mustard please? I have dried mustard powder and mustard with mustard seeds. is either one correct?
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Yes, a splash of vinegar and this turned out just right!
Creamy Coleslaw#0#1#&gt; I used to work the salad bar at ryan's - we used the simple ingredients (buttermilk, mayo, sugar - mixed together and poured across the cole slaw mixture! we used this combo dressing for many of the other fruit salads and broccoli & cauliflower salad & carrot and raisin salad! when making dressing... 1/2 cup buttermilk, 1/2 cup mayo (kraft or duke's or sauer's) and 3/4 cup of sugar... NO salt is added (u get to do that u eat it) 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Delicious! I have made it with only mayo when I haven't had sour cream in the refrigerator. 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Love this I add lemon juice
Creamy Coleslaw#1#1#This was a really good slaw but like some other reviewers noted, it did need a bit of vinegar. I added 1 tablespoon of cider vinegar and the flavor elevated. At first I thought it was a lot of mayo and sour cream for only one package of slaw mix but it was the right amount. Before you combine the dressing and slaw, taste to adjust flavor to your tastes. I also added black pepper, just because I like pepper! As a Volunteer Field Editor I recommend this recipe.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I really love creamy, mayo based cole slaw. This one has a great mix of sweet and sour, although a bit of vinegar might add a little acid to accentuate the flavor. I made it for guests and they all loved it.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I have never really been a coleslaw person, but my entire family loves this recipe and so do I!! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#To make this a one disher versus two dishes, I made the dressing first, in a Rubbermaid type container, then added the cabbage mixture. I can flip it every so often in the fridge til dinner time, instead of stirring it.I've made it several times since then, and we've enjoyed it. We enjoy a hint of vinegar (lime juice, or other acidic) to cut down on the overall sweetness, so I did add that, in the additional makings. I also cut down on the sugar ever so slightly (personal preference, not the recipe's fault).To make the slaw the star, we make tortillas on these hot summer nights, using this slaw, a tortilla wrap, and leftover grilled pork (though shrimp, fish, or chicken are all okay, too).Thanks for sharing this recipe. Sorry I did make the modifications, so it isn't really the original, but, I hate doing dishes, so, I try to conserve whenever possible. 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Very easy to fix and good to eat. Using coleslaw mix really cuts down on prep time.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This is a great recipe especially for the appealing stick to veg texture of dressing. If thinner is preferred, spruce up with either cider vinegar, or buttermilk or a splash of pineapple juice! It's all good!! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I love this recipe....after having it sit in fridge for couple of hours I add more coleslaw too. It is the best recipe I have found .....definitely a 5 star recipe.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Loved this dish . I did shred my own cabbage and added a little onion, green pepper, carrot and 1/8 tsp white pepper. Also substituted Splenda for the sugar. This deserves a 5-star review!!!!... Next time I make this dish, I will either make less dressing or add more cabbage as it is a little heavy on the sauce . 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#The flavor is good, but the texture/consistency of the dressing is too thick. Coleslaw dressing is typically more drippy or runny. Since this is a mayonnaise/sour cream base, it's the same base that's used in veggie or chip dips (thick). This recipe will do until I find a more traditional one. 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Great Recipe! Made this last night, very easy & yummy! For health reasons, used light mayo & sour cream, followed the recipe exactly. Will never buy ready made coleslaw again!Thank you for sharing your recipe.
Creamy Coleslaw#2#0#This coleslaw recipe was excellent! rave reviews at dinner! I had a 32 oz. bag of the shredded cabbage which is over double the recipe and decided not to double the dressing mix to cut on calories and after the slaw sat for awhile and I stirred it occasionally the cabbage shrinks and there was plenty of dressing for me. I am watching my calories and did not change the dressing part. Hellman's is my favorite mayo. I did add craisins also and it was great! Thank you for sharing! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#YUMMY!! I didn't have celery salt, so I used celery seed also. The mix of mayo & sour cream did it, Perfect!! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This recipe is Amazing!!! Been using it for years. Haven't came across another one yet that tops it. Thank you for sharing it. Everybody I serve it to loves it! Didn't change a thing or add anything to the recipe. It's perfect as is! 
Creamy Coleslaw#2#0#In my entire life, I have never been able to make coleslaw and actually have it come out good despite having tried just about every recipe on the planet. I decided to give it one last ditch effort and all I can say is, this TO DIE FOR!!! It has the perfect creaminess and balance of tastes for us - thank you so much, Renee, for saving me from ever having to buy supermarket coleslaw again!
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I try to watch my salt intake so instead celery salt I used celery seed. Other than that no changes. Delicious!
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Recently moved away from NYC. Missing good deli salads. This coleslaw recipe was just perfect. Rave reviews from the entire family!
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This is, hands down, the best coleslaw recipe I've eve made! Didn't change a thing except that my daughter actually liked it! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This is a wonderful tasting salad. I used some of it to top pulled pork sandwiches and it makes a nice mix. The only change I would make next time is to add some apple cider vinegar, personal preference. Will make again.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#excellent
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I have been making a form of this recipe for years - without the salts. Doesn't need it with the mayo and prepared mustard. Also I thinly slice celery into it. 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#1#I made this yesterday and it is DELICIOUS! A friend of mine stopped by our house today and tried it, she loved it too and demanded the recipe. I added a little extra celery salt, and a splash of apple cider vinegar. I also wasn't sure which type of mayo to use, so I used half Hellmans and half Miracle whip. It was simply AMAZING! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This is the best coleslaw recipe I have ever made. I did shred my own cabbage and carrots, but otherwise, I followed the directions exactly. I was amazed that it was so good, as I have tried other recipes I did not care for, and even some restaurants don't make it well. This is a keeper! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Have made this for years..but cut the mayo to 1/3 cup and add 3 or 4 Tb of vinegar, cut sugar to 1Tb
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Our favorite coleslaw recipe!
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Looks yummy and healthy food...good idea
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Super easy and turns out great every time.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Very easy and delicious. Family loved it. Will be making this regularly :)
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#What kind of seasoned salt do you use?
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Very good and simple.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This is GREAT!
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I have made this several times and it is delicious. Never any leftovers.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#So simple and everyone should have all ingredients in their pantry. It's delish! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Quick, easy and delicious! !
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#best coleslaw in the world wouldn't change a thing on it easy to make 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I felt it was somewhat bland. I added celery seed and a splash of apple cider vinegar and that made it much better. It's a keeper. 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#We thought it was rather bland. For leftovers, I add some shredded cheddar cheese & that improved the flavor a little. Needs celery seed, green pepper, onion, or some other add-ins.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This is the best coleslaw that I've ever had & I made it! So very tasty & creamy. 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This is my go-to recipe for coleslaw. Haven't found another one better. Have been making this recipe for years! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This is so easy and delicious! I added one half chopped green apple. Thanks for sharing - it is one of my family's favorites! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This is the slaw recipe I've been looking for...fantastic! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#FINALLY! I've tried so many times to find a coleslaw recipe that would win my husband's approval. He said this was perfect! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Very good! I didn't have the celery salt, but it was good without it. I also added one chopped green apple for extra crunch and sour flavor. My husband said it was a keeper! Thanks for sharing! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Been looking for a great slaw recipe for long time - found it! A local BBQ restaurant makes delicious slaw and this recipe is almost identical. I did not use pre-packaged slaw mix; used small head of cabbage & few small carrots. This will now be my go-to slaw recipe! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I have made this recipe often and always get requests for the recipe and the family loves it too. This is now the only recipe I use for coleslaw. It is perfect and so good. The only change is I use two bags of slaw mix.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I cut the sugar by at least half, and cut my own vegetables. Other than that, this recipe is basically excellent and very tasty and easy!
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This is an excellent recipe. I have tried a lot of others. My family loved it. Will make again.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I personally felt it was too rich and that it needed more of an acid, so with a little bit of apple cider vinegar it turned out great.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I sub. plain yogurt for sour cream since is what I had on hand. All family said they would have never guessed it had yogurt in it. Tangy, but not sour. Better than Colonel Sanders!
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#didnt like the taste was kinda blaw
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This is the best coleslaw that I've ever tasted and that includes all the restaurant slaws. I always make it the day before I'm serving it. Then right before serving, I drain it well. I've used this recipe dozens of times and have gotten dozens of compliments. Excellent recipe! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I used a bag of brocolli coleslaw this time and it worked just as well. Very versatile dressing
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This is the best homemade coleslaw I have ever eaten. It is now a family favorite.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#That
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#So good and so easy! Love it! :)
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I have been using this exact recipe for years and everyone who eats it, loves it. They all want the recipe. I am the only one who is allowed to make the coleslaw. Thanks for a great recipe.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Basic coleslaw recipe at it's best. Simple assembly, perfect balance of sweetness. 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I used celery seed instead, added some grated carrot to add color. Doubled recipe for large head of cabbage since we like real creamy. This recipe beats my mother's recipe and I always loved her slaw! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Sometimes coleslaw is too sweet and sometimes it's too tart. This is a good balance. I used celery seeds instead of the celery salt because I like them. A keeper. 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#My husband and family just love this cole slaw recipe. After making it the first time, we decided to add 2 bags of cole slaw instead of just 1 and it is even better. We will be making it all summer for BBQ's! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This is a great dressing recipe for this type of coleslaw. Will be making this often in the future.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Loved the creaminess! Next time I'll add a little kick - maybe horseradish! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I accidently used red wine vinegar instead of cider but it's awesome anyway! Will be great with steak! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Delicious and sooo quick!
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#forgot to add the 5 stars.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Excellent! I added chopped green onions.mmmm
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Good coleslaw, but nothing fantastic. A lot of cholesterol and fat in one serving! I prefer my old recipe with apple cider vinegar instead. Easy to make if time is tight. I substituted freshly cut cabbage and carrot instead of slaw mix.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This is a really good slaw recipe. I don't usually like a creamy dressing. Sometimes I make the dressing and instead of mixing it with the cabbage I slice cucumbers and onions and put the dressing on that. Very good, try it! 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I love this recipe and I usually don't rate recipes but this one is a 5 STARS in my book 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Another winning recipe to add to my collecton! I have family who won't eat cabbage. They loved it! Quick and easy as well as easy on the budget! Will beaming often. 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This is the best coleslaw recipe - and so easy! I have requests for it every time I make it and take it somewhere.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Very good basic slaw dressing without an overpowering flavor of mayo or vinegar. I left out the celery salt because I didn't have any. 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#The best coleslaw I ever made..... creamy and sweet!
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#We love this coleslaw.I've tried other recipes but keep coming back to this one. 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#I don't even like most coleslaw but I love this one. 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Love this coleslaw. It's my go to recipe. I always add a little red onion and sometimes celery or red pepper as well. 
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#Very Very Good!! I make it all the time now!
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This coleslaw is sooo good! It was a hit with all of my friends. Because of the variety of spices this coleslaw was fresh and tasty.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This was so fresh and tasty! I will never buy store-made coleslaw again. I reduced the amount of sugar by half and added a half teaspoon of dillweed for taste and appearance.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#This coleslaw was very tasty! Because of a low sodium diet, i did not add the seasoned salt or the celery salt and it still tasted delicious. Thanks for the recipe.
Creamy Coleslaw#0#0#excellent recipe!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#We call them Glorified Snickers and they are requested every holiday!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#2#0#Hi I haven't tried this one yet, but in reading the recipe instructions and the comments about taxing job of cutting, perhaps you could lift the candy out of the pan and cut it with a large pizza cutter? Just a thought. I will be trying this one!! ??
Chocolate Caramel Candy#2#2#This is hands down one of the most delicious things I've ever made! It is a little putzy, but it's not difficult by any means. I couldn't find regular caramels, so I used caramel bits and didn't have any difficulty with oozing like others have commented. The only bad thing is that trying to cut the candy is like trying to cut a brick with a pair of scissors..... Also, if the candy gets too soft, despite how hard it is to cut, the top layer with come off, so I'd place it back in the fridge halfway through cutting and then cut again. Despite the effort, I'll definitely be making this again. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Delicious! These are time consuming, but fun to make when you have some time you want to spend in the kitchen. Well worth the time. Always get lots of compliments.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This is a wonderful recipe and everyone who tries this candy loves it! It's true that it tastes like a Snickers bar, only way better! I have no trouble with the candy falling apart, contrary to what some of the other reviewers have stated. Cutting into the chocolate with a warm, sharp knife will help make the cutting easier. I also add less heavy cream (almost by half) when melting the caramels. I followed other reviewers' advice on that and it did prevent the caramel from oozing between the layers. Also, in the past, I've placed the pan in my freezer to help speed up the hardening process of the different recipes. This candy is especially great when made around Christmas time.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#8#Why is this listed under low carb recipes? Not even close!!! 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I started making these at Christmas three years ago. They are the best and liked by all of my family. That is the first candy they ask for.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#These are delicious! I took them to work and they were a hit!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#These are delicious but they are time consuming as many other reviewers have stated. Also, I had big problems with them falling apart too. I'd like to know how they got that pic posted because even in the fridge the chocolate slid off the top of the caramel. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I followed the directions exactly and they were AWESOME! Reminded me of my recipe for nut goodie bars or Snicker's bars only tastier! 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#1#Very time consuming to make, a lot of steps and ingredients. The taste is that of a Snickers bar so for me it is not worth the effort. I followed the recipe exactly and made sure that each layer had set up in the refrigerator before adding the next and let sit over night before cutting. The fudge cut into perfect one inch squares.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This is the BEST RECIPE. Cant put it down !! 10
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Taste just like Snickers candy bar. It all held together for me. I put mine in freezer then took it out after about 1 hour then cut it. It cuts much smoother very cold or almost frozen.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I have made this recipe for years. It's always a hit and one of my hubby's favorites. I don't make it often enough for him!! I do use a little less cream in my caramel mixture so it is not as runny. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#1#Tasty but otherwise a flop! Top layer separated from caramel. By the time I sawed thru the caramel the nougat layer was smashed. Am an experienced cook but these bars made me look like a beginner. I would love to hear if anyone was able to cut these neatly enough to put on a serving tray. If someone did--add details to the recipe. As it stands, I will never waste the time and money on this recipe again.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#five stars for taste, 4 stars for time consuming. everyone loves the taste. have to keep them refrigerated or the filling sags. wonder how it would be with Dulce de Leche in place of the caramel layer?
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This candy is one of our family's favorites! As others said, it's time consuming to make; that's the only reason it doesn't get included every Christmas. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Question: Does one 7 ounce jar of marshmallow cream equal1 1/2 cup needed for recipe?
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#2#I was just wondering if these can be frozen?
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I tried this recipe today,time consuming,the big problem I faced was one cooled and cut the top layer was sliding off the rest of the bar also the photo on the recipe shows the bar having a carmeal color and mine has a chocolate colored topping...help please I want to try this again.This bar is very tasy but with the top sliding off its not what I can serve
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#1#This stuff is awesome. DO take the time to make it! It's not like eating some piece of candy from the store. It tastes homemade and way better than Snickers. I wrap the pieces individually and box them as gifts. People RAVE about this candy! I always have reprints of the recipe handy because I'm constantly asked for it. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I have been making this for years. The family and friends love this treat.Thank you for sharing this recipe. We all love this treat.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Haven't made this yet, but I know it will be something I'll make again and again. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I used your filling layer and caramel layer and let it set up. Then I cut them into bite size pieces and dipped them in chocolate candy coating. They are just like snickers mini's. Great recipe. Thank you. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Remind me of a snickers bars. Time consuming to make but easy.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#So good, taste like a homemade snickers bar!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Love them! They are always a big hit among friends and family :)
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This is the best candy!!! If you love snicker bars, you're gonna love these!!! 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Very good. Next time, I'll decrease the amount of cream in the caramels. Like last poster, they oozed. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#So delicious ! They don't last long. A little fussy, lots of steps but easy. I ended up keeping them in the fridge, if not they kind of ooze. The nugget layer reminds me of a Big Hunk bar. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This is delicious, far better than any candy bar I have even eaten! Although the process is time consuming, it is very easy!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Absolutely Phenomenal!! WAY better than a snickers bar. Everyone who has had these always asks when will I make it again?
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#These are the bomb!! We left out the peanuts as our family isn't a peanut fan. We had to keep it refridgerated because the carmel melted. I will definitely make again!! 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#The caramel candies are great, you have to try them !
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Very good and very tasty. Would make again.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#OMG! This will be a new Christmas treat every year. It is really putzy and kind of hardto cut into nice squares but well worth it. I left out the peanuts because I don't like the texture. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I have made these Caramel Candies two years in a row, they have been a big hit. I wrap them individually and use for gift giving.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This candy received such great reviews that I tried it. I froze the layers and gave them time to set then refrigerated the whole thing. It seemed to turn out great so I put them in treat boxes for the holidays. After a little while I started noticing the melting that someone else mentioned. The candy started to slide as the caramel softened. I think these either need to be served chilled or need to be dipped in a chocolate paraffin to keep them together.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Used marshmallow fluff instead of creme
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Every time I make this candy everyone asks me for the recipe. It is a real winner!!!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Everyone loved this recipe. It kind of taste like Snickers. It's really delicious. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#1#0#I made this recipe when it first came out in the Taste of Home magazine in about 1998, I think. I may as well not show up for Christmas Day gathering if I don't have them. ;-) I share this recipe with everyone. The only change, which puts it over the top for flavor is that I make home made microwave caramel instead of buying it. It makes it irresistable! 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Christmas favourite!!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#TASTES GOOD ENOUGH, A LOT OF STEPS, MY FAMILY JUST WAS'NT A BIG FAN 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This candy is outstanding! A little putzy because of the layers, but worth the effort.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Made this for my cookie trays this year. After sitting out a while the caramel melts so to fix this I just coated the pieces with chocolate and they looked like a mini candy bar. Tastes just like the real thing. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Hi, Can someone help me, these are really good, but they fall apart even after I let them set and freeze them.  What am I doing wrong?  As messy as they are, they are still GOOD!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This candy got rave reviews everywhere I shared it. I wound up having to make two batches to last throughout the holidays.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I made this over the weekend while doing my holiday baking. Everyone absolutely LOVES it! Will definately make this again and will share the recipe with family and friends.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#My layers are seperating when I try to cut into square. I let it sit for 20 min. before cutting. Then let it sit a little longer but then the marshmallow layer starts to squash out. Any suggestions????
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This recipe was ok but I had a problem keeping the caramel firm. The warmer if got, the more it melted. I think next time I would use a more firmer caramel recipe (ie sweetened condensed milk)
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#These are very good! I was concerned about how long it would take them to get firm in the refrigerator, but it was ready by the time I prepared the next layer.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This recipe is excellent! I've been making this each year ever since I found the recipe in Taste of Home! It is a family favorite during Christmas and into New Year's. It is well worth the time, effort and money spent to make it!! 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I made the candy today. I had one problem with the filling. I couldn't cook it for 5 minutes. After 4 minutes it became very gritty and I couldn't use. I threw the filling out and started over and cooked for less time. I did add 2 tablespoons of honey for all layers that called for peanut butter. I always use honey in all peanut butter recipes. I also use a square cake pan 8 x 8 for the candy. I like my candy thicker with smaller squares when served. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This was the favorite candy for my Christmas Candy for the whole family.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#My family won't even let me through the door if I don't have these in hand. I've been making these for years - absolutely the best! 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I've been making these for years and is a holiday tradition! My family LOVES them!! 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#These are to die for. When I make them I have to freeze half the recipe if not they are all gone in 2 days.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This candy is worth every penny you spend on ingredients and every pound you gain from eating it. Delicious and impressive.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This is soooo yummy! I've made this several times. I am now asked to make it each Christmas also by family & friends who have tried it. Excellent recipe! 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I have made this recipe several times. It is delicious and reminds me of one of my favorite candy bars. A hint for those who are having problems with the chocolate topping cracking when trying to cut into squares. Take the pan from the refrigerator and let it sit on your counter until the chocolate warms up a little. The caramel will also soften some and be easier to cut. It is a winner!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This took time to make but the results are amazing. Everyone who has tried it has loved it and I have passed the recipe on to many friends and co-workers. I kept it refrigerated.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I made this recipe a few days ago for the first time after reading all the rave reviews, and found it to be awesomely good! However, like some of the other reviews, I too had a problem with the top icing layer cracking and breaking to pieces when I cut it, and it didn't stick to the caramel layer under it. I was dissapointed by that happening and wondered if anyone has a solution to keeping the top icing layer from breaking into many pieces and not sticking to the caramel layer? I followed the directions completely and also followed what the reviewer, spoir10692 wrote on December 22, 2010 to keep the top icing layer from spliting/cracking, and it still didn't work. I also had a problem of cutting it into nice square pieces since the caramel layer was hard to cut through and it came out in jagged edges. It didn't look like the evenly cut pieces in the picture at all and I found it took me a long time to made it. Well, after all this, I still will keep trying to make this turn out right since it was SO delicious and adictive! 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This was a huge hit at both parties I took them to this year. Easy to make, although they take time because of the need to let them harden between layers. Had no problems with the icing cracking or the caramel running. We kept them in the refrigerator or freezer until about a half an hour before serving. To store, I buttered the bottom of a pyrex container lightly, made one layer with the candies, then put parchment paper down and made another layer on top. Between chilling them and the parchment paper, it kept them from sticking together too much.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I give it 5 stars for sure. Everyone loved these candies. I had a problem with the carmel running though. Any tips?
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This was great and it makes alot. Alittle pricy to make but worth it. It will become one of my Christmas candy favs.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This recipe is going to become a regular to make during the holidays....yummy! I figured I would be creative and made it in individual paper cups. This was NOT a good way to go. While it taste just as good, it took a lot of extra time. Save yourself the headache and simply make it in a 9X13 pan as the recipe calls for. After cutting them into squares they can easily be placed in mini paper cups for easy serving so they don't stick together. The nougat filling is to die for all by itself! I'm trying to think of a new candy to make that incorporates that alone. Thanks for submitting this recipe. All that tried it LOVED it! 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This is fabulous! Everyone who has eaten has raved over it. It will be an annual holiday treat at our house from now on.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#My Husband LOVES Snickers. So I decided to give this a try... Needless to say the whole family loves this! Even my sister in law who doesn't like chocolate was coming back for more! Great Recipe! 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This was a fantastic recipe! Very simple and easy to make, and I got RAVE reviews when I took them to our family Christmas party! I have requests to make these again for sure!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I found this to be difficult, time consuming, expensive, and I doubt seriously if I ever try to make it again.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I love this recipe! My icing did not break/crumble. What I did was I let the final icing layer set at room temp for several hours prior to putting it in the fridge. I let it set overnight and then when I took it out I let it get to room temp (approx 1 hour) then cut with a paring knife. The caramel did not run either.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Wonderful!!! Every year the kids demand that I make this! A huge hit with everyone!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This recipe was a hit. As for the chocolate cracking-not quite sure what you all did. My only problem I had was I did not have a 13 X 9 pan - mine was 18 X 12. I just used 1/2 of the pan-it was thin but still a HIT! No cracked chocolate- I used giaradelli (sp) milk chocolate. Had that on hand. Plus it was cheaper than nestles at the time.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This recipe was fairly easy to make. However, the icing didn't work well for me. While cooking, it became very thick and wouldn't spread. So I added a tablespoon of butter to thin it out. It spread very well. I let it set in the refridgerator and did as the instructions said and let it set out for 20 minutes before cutting. The icing fell into a million pieces. So I'm not sure what else I could do. But it is very delicious as is with or without icing and I would make it again. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#The taste was amazing, but even with wiping the knife off each time the chocolate cracked (top layer) and the caramel can't be out of the fridge for more than 5 miuntes without melting. Kinda frustrating as I made them to pass out and they weren't cheap to make. But very tasty. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#It's a bit difficult to cut as it has to be just right at room temperature to cut, but the taste is awesome; I'll definitely add this to my candy recipe box. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#My husband and I made this recipe and loved. We plan on trying ours with pecans the next time. Also made a mistake or two due to drinking wine while making it. LOL Recipe was forgiving on our mistakes. Good Luck and Enjoy!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Try heating the knife in hot water, wipe dry, then slice. Do this before each time you slice and the chocolate shouldn't crack, or at least not nearly as much :P 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This recipe was great, but I got so frustrated when the chocolate kept cracking while I was cutting it. Does anyone have a solution to this problem? Thanks!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I love this recipe, but every time I make these, when I cut them the top layer cracks so they don't look so pretty. The caramel mixture also spills over the sides, not pretty but very good. Maybe I should try freezing them so the caramel stays put. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I found this recepie in one of my Taste of Home magazine I got from my mother in law from 1997. I make it every year for Christmas and they are always a hit.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I made this candy and it was a huge hit! Passed out the recipe to 20 or so people. I did cheat a little and melted the first and last layer in the micro-turned out great! Thanks for a wonderful addition to my Christmas candy tray.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This has become a family favorite. Many steps and many ingredients, yes but WELL worth the effort. Makes an impressive gift also. Make some yourself, you won't regret it! YUM 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Alot of steps, alot of ingredients. Bottom later was a bit too soft to do in a pan again. I may do it in the little candy cups.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This is a recipe with many steps, but the end result is incredibly worth it. It is so very delicious and is a hit with everyone who has tasted it. Yours will be the most popular treat if you make this for get togethers.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I make this recipe a couple of times a year and constantly get requests to make it again. At work they have been nicknamed Nuggets of Love 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I make this every year. It is SOOOOO good. Best candy you will make. One I cut it into squares i place each in a small candy paper cup. keeps them from sticking together.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#made this recipe several years ago. amazing, well worth the effort. My friend and I partner up on this recipe had a great afternoon and wonderful candy to take at the end of the day
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I got this recipe from you a few years ago. I have to make it every year or I hear about it. My grandson asked me to make it for a bake sale one year. It was the first to go. I don't think they would let me in to the family get together without it. This or peanut butter fudge. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I entered this in a recipe contest and won first place. I have made this many times and also tried woth the white chips for a different taste. It's very good made with dark chocolate also. Will make this again!!!Thanks for a great and easy recipe. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I was just thrilled to see this recipe. I used to make it a few years ago, but lost the recipe. I am definitly going to make it this Holdiday season. My family just loves it. Rates right up there with toffee fudge!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#These are now one of my families new Christmas favorites. They did take a bit more time to put together but just worked on other Christmas goodies while they set up for each step. Made them with semi-sweet choc chips and were delicous!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Great recipe! It may seem like a lot of steps, but really very easy. This recipe is a keeper. Even thought about trying to make it with almonds like the Snicker Almond Bar, hmmm!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Although these take a few hours to make, they are delicious!I just took them to my work's picnic and they were gone well before the night was over. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I took this to a bake sale and got calls for a week @ work from people wanting the recipe. My husband loves it also.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#SOOOOOOO rich and delicious. Takes a few hours to put together, but is so worth it!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#These were insanely good. Made a batch and took them on our summer camping trip to the lake. Passed the container around and it came back empty. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Very delicious! Tastes just like my favorite candy bar!
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This is fantastic! We make this candy often, and it's always a hit. It makes a lot, so we have plenty to share. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I took this to work where this was greatly enjoyed. I keep getting requests for the recipe.
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#These look wonderful. I can't wait to get the ingredients and make them. 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#This candy tastes like a Snickers bar... only better! This recipe has made me famous at church receptions! ~Debi
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Hi Jane, I love your Chocolate Caramel Candy. I have made it many times. But I was wondering if this recipe can be made a head of time and then freeze it until needed? Thank You ruthiebear
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Re: Chocolate Caramel CandyI love this recipe Jane. I have made it many times but I was wondering if this candy can be frozen? ruthiebear
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#I'm a big Snickers fan so I had to try this candy. It was delicious!Leigh 
Chocolate Caramel Candy#0#0#Thank you very much Jane for sharing this. The picture sold me! LOL It looks Fantastic! Printing this recipe up and I might even attempt to make it tonight! Have a good evening! Jackie 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#22#2#The order of the recipe didn't make sense and would be more difficult for a novice cook to follow than it should. I would melt butter then add veggies and flour to cook, add broth and allow to simmer. It definitely needs salt and pepper and maybe something else. 3 cups of wild rice is too much, try 2 cups. Omit the wine, just use broth. This recipe just needed to be simplified and add some salt and it's good. I made all those changes and it's much better.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#4#2#This wasn't terrible, but wasn't good. It is greatly lacking in flavor. I would add more celery, carrots, parsley, onion, salt and pepper. It needs a lot of help. 2 stars 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#7#0#I made this soup per the directions with the exception that I did not have cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken. It was very good and I will definitely add it to go to list of recipes. Thank you. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#7#1#I made this exactly as the recipe says and it was soooooooooooo good! We absolutely loved the soup! A definite on the make again list! Outstanding recipe! Thank you so much for sharing.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#15#9#I made this last night for dinner. I did not put any mushrooms in it because my daughter doesn't like them. She doesn't have any objections to cream of mushroom soup but I used cream of chicken with herbs because it sounded good. The soup was very filling, more so than I expected. It was also very tasty. Because it made so much, I may get some mushrooms today and saute them to add to the soup and have again tonight. It will depend on how much I find in the fridge. If I make this again, it will be for more than 2 people. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#16#2#Can another rice be substituted for the wild rice?
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#2#5#This is my favorite soup! I'm not a fan of mushrooms so I leave them out and use Cream of Chicken with Herbs (or Cream of Celery). I purée the soup with the 1/2 cup of broth (or wine). I also add a half cup of toasted blanched almond slivers. A little extra chicken and rice make a thicker soup (I use a wild rice blend). Everyone loves this soup!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#3#1#This was my first time making wild rice, it was simple. We truly enjoyed this soup and the depth of flavor the wild rice gives. The next time I make this, I will increase the amount of white wine for increased flavor. Didn't use the canned soup, instead I used evaporated milk with cornstarch added. To avoid the other reviewer's complaints of runny soup , I reduced the chicken broth to 1 1/2 quarts. I only added 2 1/2 c. of wild rice because the 4oz. package only yielded that much. The soup was a perfect consistency. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#4#5#I grew up eating my mom's wild rice soup, but when I wanted to try it for myself, I couldn't get the recipe right away, so I tried this one instead. It was an instant hit with my family and everyone raves about how good it was for a few days after. I'm going to make it this time using leftover turkey from Thanksgiving, and my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Thank you so much for sharing :)
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#2#0#I make a version of this soup often in the Instant Pot and it's consistently requested by family and now friends. Instead of a cream soup, I use a combination of evaporated and whole milk combined with corn starch for thickening. Otherwise, the ingredients are the same and it's delicious! 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This is one of our family favorites. My son always reminds wursts it when he comes home for a visit.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#4#0#Skipped the canned soup and wine and added heavy cream instead.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#6#0#I am from Minnesota, and I continue coming back to this recipe again and again. It is perfect as written but allows you to adjust if you don't have everything on hand. We often add more mushrooms and skip the chicken altogether. This is the best recipe! 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Question: if I leave out the chopped mushrooms, should I use 2 cans of cream of mushroom?
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#5#Made a couple of improvisions and It was awesome!. I did cut rice quantity in half and think actually 1 cup would be sufficient. Didn't have celery but had celery salt, so I used the bottom heart of romaine lettuce and doused it with celery salt. Preferred chopped carrots, so chopped carrots instead. I didn't use wine in the recipe but used additional broth. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#4#2#I made this during Corona virus shut down so I made adjustments to what I had. I used cream of bacon soup instead of the cream of mushroom as I couldn't find any at the store and I was out, I halved the recipe and didn't have the dried parsley but I did everything else pretty much as the recipe called for. I used canned wild rice because I always have that on hand. It was delicious. My husband loved it and told me he'd be glad to have that again, so It will go into my soup collection but I think I'll stick with the cream of bacon soup because we really liked the subtle depth it gave the soup. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#2#0#I substituted cream of chicken because I bought the wrong thing and skipped the wine. The other ingredients came from a leftover veggie platter and a chicken and rice dinner. It was DELICIOUS.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#1#Great recipe and added to favorites. I left out wine and substituted canned chicken. Tasted delicious!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#0#This is a wonderful soup.. I highly recommend it! I made an easy chicken stock from a rotisserie chicken and then followed the rest of the instructions. Didn't have the wine so I skipped it. This turned out delicious!! 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#3#This soup is quite good, but time consuming for preparation. I followed the recipe to a T ..with the exception of slicing the carrots. I gave it a 4 star rating as the amount of flour/butter did not thicken the soup. 1/3 cup flour 6 T butter would probably be much better. Unfortunately the soup was watery 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#0#Pretty tasty! Followed the recipe exactly except I added a little more chicken broth and some instant white rice along with the wild rice (I used instant for both and added the last 5 minutes). Chopped the carrots instead of grating them because we love carrots and wanted to really taste them. Oh and I did add a little chicken bouillon seasoning powder. Those changes were minimal the recipe stands on it's own. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#0#loved this soup. I also chopped carrots instead of grating them
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#2#0#This soup is awesome. I cook for a large family so increased a couple of the ingredients. I saute' the onion, celery, carrots and mushrooms in a little butter and add meat from a whole roasted chicken, chopped. Also, increased the mushrooms and added 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup. This is a winner! 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#We love this recipe. Great for cold winter days.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#4#0#Loved this soup, definitely a keeper! I followed it to a t but did not use wine. Was skeptical of the thyme as it had a different flavor and have not cooked with it before. Put it in slow cooker all afternoon and the thyme was a nice flavor at 1/4 tsp. Thank you for sharing.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#0#This soup is awesome! Hot, hearty, and delicious, perfect for a cold winter night. I cooked up some chicken thighs and used quick-make wild rice to make the process a little faster. I doubled the spices (garlic powder, thyme, and parsley) since 1/4 a teaspoon of each didn't seem like much and used wine (I'd recommend using it instead of extra broth!) Also added a dollop of sour cream when I served it, made it even more creamy and yummy. Really tasty, highly recommend. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#0#This soup is wonderful! I chopped the carrots instead of grating them, otherwise followed recipe exactly. I know it says you can skip the wine, but do yourself a favor and don't! It adds such an amazing flavor! 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#0#Followed the recipe to a t - EXCELLENT! Added to my recipe file, one of the best I've tried. Great fall & winter soup. Thanks for sharing.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#2#0#Very good soup.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I wish I could have made this soup the way it is listed but due to picky eaters I had to leave out the mushrooms. Instead I added two cans of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken and blended it. It still turned out really good.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Delicious! reviews are spot on! I skipped mushrooms and substituted cream of chicken soup and added spinach instead of celery.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#0#I too am originally from Minnesota & this soup hit the spot! Nothing takes me home quite like a bowl of this soup.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This soup was really good! I added some finely shredded Swiss cheese for a little zing! My family loved it!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This was really good! Very good and easy to make!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This soup was delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe. I made it for my husbands office workers. They said it was better than any soup they have ever had at any restaurant! Its definitely a recipe I will be making again.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#0#This was so delicious! It is absolutely comfort food! I used rotisserie chicken and 2 packages pre made uncle bens wild rice, which comes in airtight bags on the rice aisle to speed up process. Turned out fabulous! Whole family loved it, this recipe is a keeper.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#0#I love chicken and rice soup and the wild rice in this recipe puts it over the top. I also cooked the rice the day before as it takes longer than regular rice!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I love chicken wild rice soup and this recipe is so delicious. It is comforting and filling. It does take a little while to make, but so worth it!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I made a double batch of this soup, and so happy I did because I have a freezer full of delicious lunches!! I hadn't made wild rice before, and didn't realize how long it takes to cook, but well worth it--I will definitely make this again 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#0#This is a good soup. I tweaked it as I didn't have the mushroom soup and skipped the flour, butter, soup directions and made a package of Williams Sausage gravy (really!) as directed and finished the soup. If you don't want to use up another pan for cooked rice, add it raw with the first 9 ingredients and simmer for 40-45 minutes. Sometimes I add 4-5 slices of real American cheese to make it even more creamy. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#0#This soup is amazing! My son tried it and said, This tastes like something you would make at Christmas! The wine adds a delicious flavor. Well worth the effort. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This is an excellent recipe for the whole family. I often just use a box of wild rice side dish mix if I don't have separate wild rice. We have it frequently and my granddaughter loves it. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Really enjoyed this soup!!! Made Near East long grain and wild rice ahead of time and chilled it. Did all the prep work ahead of time, added some frozen peas and it was a cinch to put together. I did use Cream of chicken soup as someone else suggested- yielded a nice quantity. Will certainly make this again!!!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This soup was just as good as the one I always get from a local restaurant. I did make a few changes such as omitting the mushrooms and using cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom. I also used a box of Rice-a-Roni long grain and wild rice with the seasoning packet so because of that I left out the spices since we are not a big spice family anyway. This soup was just as good a couple of days later when we had the leftovers. I will certainly be making it again as the cold weather months get here
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#0#I'm going to try this, bet it is good. Lived in East Bethel, MN 10 years. As I read through the recipe I thought Where is the cream of mushroom soup??? Then I saw it. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#My neighbor made this today and brought me a bowl....absolutely gourmet bowl of heaven! She is a great cook and this was wonderful. Can't even imagine I could duplicate. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I had never made this soup, but being a Minnesotan, I figured I'd give it a try. I was blown away at how easy it was to make, not to mention how tasty it was! Swapped the fresh white mushrooms with Baby Bellas, then BOOM, the flavor is so earthy you just can't stop eating it! And with it being low-cal, I will definitely be making this instead of getting it from Panera! 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I made this tonight using gluten free cream of mushroom soup, gluten free all-purpose flour and mini portabello mushrooms. This is a very good, restaurant quality soup! Thank you for sharing!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Made this soup today and it is delicious. It has lots of flavor and a nice consistency. It is not a thick creamy soup but is full of veggies, chicken and rice. I did make the flour and butter into a rue; cooked for 2 minutes then added chicken broth; cooked another 2 minutes then I added the canned soup to this mixture to heat in order to ensure no flour taste and got a real nice cream texture to add to the soup. The only change I made was to use cream of chicken soup but mushroom would be equally nice. This recipe is time consuming so do the prep work ahead as Virginia suggested or just be prepared that it will definitely take longer than 10 minutes to prepare. Will definitely be making again. Thanks Virginia.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#1#This was a very flavorful soup! I followed both the recipe and some of the other reviewers' comments (mix the flour, broth and wine together and then stir into the butter). Next time, I will use the soup as a sauce for chicken breast (minus the carrots, the cubed cooked chicken and wild rice on the side), as its consistency, smoothness and delicate flavor could easily make this a great sauce for a main dish. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#0#Used less butter and reduced sodium broth, soup and bouillon. Cooked the wild rice in a good rice cooker for perfect consistency. Will definitely make again. 5 stars!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This soup is very tasty! My only problem is that the cooked wild rice didn't yield three cups. I followed the package directions exactly but maybe I did something wrong. I had never cooked it until using it in this recipe. I ended up cooking some 5 minute long grain and wild rice (without the seasoning packet) to add to it and that made it yummy. Other than that, it's a delicious, hearty, and low fat soup! I'll be making this one again! 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#1#I made this soup exactly as listed except I did as another reviewer said and mixed the flour, broth and wine together and then stirred into the butter. I also substituted a wild rice/quinoa blend as that was what I had in the house. It is very delicious. Made enough for two meals for the two of us.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#1#I really, really, really loved this soup!!! I took it to a Wednesday evening church dinner and was asked for the recipe by five different people. I did leave out the wine and the extra chicken broth; otherwise, followed the recipe to a tee.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#The flavor was great. I did add some garlic to the celery,onion, carrot mixture. My husband loved it and he is not a fan of rice.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#2#0#This is my third time making this soup & it is excellent. I'm surprised that some of the reviewers stated the soup is too thin. I use the full 2 quarts of broth & with the 3 cups of cooked wild rice, it is plenty thick. Make sure you don't skip the melted butter and flour mixture because that also will give the soup a thicker, heartier, creamier consistency. I do that part differently than what the recipe says. I use a small saucepan to melt the butter. Then I add the flour and 1/2 cup broth (I actually use water) and bring it to a boil till it's thick & pasty. Then I add it to the soup mixture. Works great! I also add 1 teaspoon of salt to the soup - and that is a personal preference. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This recipe is very good & it freezes well!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I've tried to make soup twice a week this winter & have tried different recipes, so have many to compare this to. My only change was to add 3 cloves garlic. It was too thin for my taste so after trying it, I added 1/2 cup barley & recooked the soup until the garlic was done. Much better. It also needed salt & pepper. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I really like this soup & it is so easy to make !! It is really great on a cold winter day or night !!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I began making this after I saw it a few years ago and really like it. Because of illness in the family, I had to do a few substitutions to get so much sodium out of it but there are easy ways to do that now...no-salt added broths, no-salt added cr. of mushroom soup, etc. What I like best about this soup is something a few people know me for...I don't like to waste food. I always put leftover rice in the freezer and when I have enough, I make this soup. The same with leftover chicken. Of late I've been adding a cup or two of chopped broccoli. Good. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#1#Really good flavor! Don't skip the wine if you can help it. It really adds. Was cautious with the broth as others said it was a little too much. I made the soup with one quart broth and at the end when I stirred in the wine and canned soup I added one more cup broth. Think that is just the right consistency. Pretty quick to throw together as well. Will make again. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#So good! Added course ground pepper, extra veggies and extra rice. Used white wine at the end (instead of the extra chicken broth option), which added extra flavor. I served it with garlic butter biscuits, which were used to sop up any extra broth (YUM!).
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Way too much liquid. I eliminated the last 1/2 cup of liquid and it was still too thin. Thickened it up a bit with additional flour & water slurry. Prepare all vegies and ingredients ahead of time. Prep goes fairly fast once it starts.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#It was okay, but way too thin of a soup for my liking. I eliminated the additional 1/2 c. of liquid called for near the end and added another can of cream of mushroom soup and a 1/2 c. of minute rice to thicken it up.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#0#My family enjoyed it!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#looks like a very healthy dish for what ails you!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Love this soup, but I add frozen chopped spinach to it as my family likes more vegies.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This makes agreat meal starter or, with a chunck of crusty bread, a meal. One of the best soups i've ever tasted. And if you will notice there is no added salt. Just do not need it, even with low sodium broth. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I made it exactly as directed. The seasonings gave it good flavor, though I didn't really care as much for the strong chicken broth flavor that the 8 cups of it gave the soup. I imagined a creamier broth based on the picture and the can of cream of mushroom soup it contained, but it really wasn't that creamy--just very chicken broth-y. Still good. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Great taste; made as noted. Very hearty soup--plenty of chicken! (I just boiled two boneless, skinless chicken breasts.). Will continue to make this soup, which consistently gets rave reviews.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This soup is awesome!!! Using some of the chicken broth from boiling the chicken worked perfectly too!! It's hearty and tastes wonderful! 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Good soup.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I have made this and everyone that taste this love it!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This is my favorite soup recipe of all time! When I make it I'm happy to eat it two meals a day for a week. I don't like to share it. It's mine...all mine. Hearty, filling and low calorie. What more could you want. I give it 5 stars and two thumbs up! 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This was very easy to make and tastes great! Will definitely make this again!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Great soup for a winter weather.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#We just made it for the first time tonight. Excellent! We followed the recipe except used cream of chicken instead of mushroom, and the chicken broth sub for white wine. Loved it!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Yummy!!!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Super good! Excellent comfort food:)
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Excellent recipe! I made it with some modifications based upon personal preference and what was on hand at the time (1 quart chicken broth, 4 cups H2O plus 4 tsp. Better than Bouillon, no mushrooms, 1/2 cup celery, 1/2 shredded carrots, 1/2 cup onions, 1/4 tsp. garlic pepper mix, 2 T canola butter, no wine, can of cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom soup and used corn starch as a thickener versus flour. My husband had never had wild rice before, and absolutely loved it!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Followed recipe and soup turned out great. Takes some prep time but well worth it. 10 minutes, I don't think so. Anyway this is now going to be a regular at our house. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I made this exactly as called for by the recipe and it was excellent! Passed the test even with my Granddaughter who doesn't like much of anything!! 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This is SO good!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I discovered this recipe a while back. I had been looking for a really good chicken and rice soup and hadn't been happy with any I had found, until this one. It is chock-fill of flavor and a real family pleaser. I didn't use the wild rice, but used a wild rice/white rice and  herb box mix that was perfect for this! Absolutely a top restaurant quality soup, yet quick and easy---my kind of recipe!! Toni Gommy of 5 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I followed some of the other reviewer's notes and didn't add the cream of mushroom soup. I also added the butter flour mixture right into the soup to thicken. I then added a cup or so of milk + half & half. I also left out the wine. It is very good. I didn't measure the mushrooms, just added all from a small package. I used the broth I made when cooking the chicken. I was very pleased with this and will definitely make again. I think it would also be good as just a brothy soup (adding no milk/cream, etc). 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This time around, I had to add more dried herbs to punch up flavor; also added fresh chives & parsley. No rave reviews from our fellowship. I didn't use the cream of mushroom soup'cuz of the MSG. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#The family LOVED it. Only thing I did differently was to throw the rice in with the first nine ingredients instead of precooking it.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#this soup is Gravy good. Awesome!!!!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This soup is amazing, great flavor. The prep took a lot longer than 10 minutes, but sooo worth it! Used a bit more chicken and rice, a Royal Blend rice.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#So good
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This soup is amazing! Really good.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Very delicious soup. I made it straight from the recipe no changes and none were needed.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#We loved this soup. I've made it twice, once with canned mushrooms and the 2nd time with fresh mushrooms. From now on I'll use fresh mushrooms always as it gave a more nutty earthy flavor to the soup. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This soup is outstanding. I will make it over and over again...My husband says it is one of the best soups he has eaten. I used one box of Uncle Ben's White and Wild Rice (original recipe) for the rice in this recipe. The only thing I did different was add 1/2 stick of butter at the end and I simmered the chicken along with the vegetables...It was wonderful and I can't wait to make it for company... 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This is delicious! Could add more chicken if you like a lot of meat but I seriously don't even think the chicken is necessary. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Everyone really liked the soup, but it had a little too much juice. Next, time I will add less chicken broth.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Awesome soup, going to be a staple recipe in my home.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Loved this soup! Planning on making it again tonight!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#It's a good soup, but rather bland. We added some salt to each serving. I'll add 1/2 tsp. of salt to the pan next time. In addition, I added a handful of shredded cheddar cheese to the last bowlful after reheating it--it was delicious. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#It was a good soup, but missing salt! Next time, I'd add 1/2 tsp of salt to give it more flavor. My family doesn't like mushrooms & carrots, so I had to omit them. I added a handful of shredded cheddar & a bit of bacon to the last cup of soup & it was wonderful. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Wonderful recipe that I will use from now on. Modifications: (1) I didn't use the canned soup, but used 2 cups of half & half at the end; (2) I couldn't find wild rice, so had to use a blended mix; (3) used chopped carrots instead of shredded. Marvelous! Family loved it!!! 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This is an outstanding recipe---family thoroughly enjoyed it and have passed it on to friends.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I did not have wild rice but used a box of Uncle Bens wild rice mix, and it worked great.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Family and friends loved itl. Nice hearty soup for cold days!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Wow! This is one of the best soups recipes I have ever made. My daughter was so disappointed when it was gone that I ran out and bought more ingredients to make more. I did modify slightly the second time around. 1 1/2 qts of chicken broth, 1/4 pound of mushrooms, and added some half and half at the end. The half and half really made it much creamier. So, so good!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#It s very good!!! My brothers like it very much!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Awesome soup! Family loved it.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#One of the best soups I have ever made. Hearty and delicious. Takes some prep time but well worth it. I made it exactly like the recipe - no changes.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Yummy when I added poultry seasoning & fresh rosemary, but put in too much so fished some out.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I used chunkier carrots cause we prefer them that way but the soup was wonderful. Perfect Christmas Eve dinner!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#How many cups of wild rice per 3 cups of cooked wild rice? I am guessing 1.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I'm sorry this isn't a review, but I plan to make this for dinner this weekend and would so like to know more about the garlic/butter/balsamic vinegar broiled French bread that fredaevans mentioned. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Made this for christmas eve dinner. Family thought it was delish! Takes a little time to make but is super tasty. A keeper!!!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This is wonderful! It takes some time to put together but well worth it.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I made this for a girls night out celebration with my close friends. I served with a pan of homemade cornbread. All of my guests asked for the recipe! 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This is a keeper. We had it last night and oh it was sooo good!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#1275 why say this is a terrific soup when you changed the whole recipe?
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This is a'Brain Dead' easy meal to make, and as noted below freezes very well. Serve with a Cesar Salad (yes, yes you want the Anchovies) and Garlic/butter/Balsamic Vinegar broiled French Bread and you have Good Eats! 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This soup is sooooo good. It is one of my all time favorites. Very much a comfort food. This recipe is a keeper, I like to keep some in the freezer at all times. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I don't like store bought soups so I made a white sauce to compensate for the cream of mushroom & added extra mushrooms. Yummy!! 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Wow I must make this soup with all the rave reviews and the fact that my husband loves wild rice I will make it for New Years dinner.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#We had this in a restaurant in MN on vacation, and it was amazing. I make it nearly the same way as this recipe, but I use smoked chicken broth for extra yum. After smoking a chicken, I boil up the carcass to make the broth.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Delicious! I added a little extra mushroom because my family loves mushrooms. Tastes great as a left over as well. Will definitely make again. Perfect for cool weather.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#The only thing I did different was double the spices and add poultry seasoning. It was so tasty! Absolutely will make again!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Really nice flavor. My prep and cook time might have take a bit longer.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Great soup recipe, just the right amount of creaminess. I halved the recipe and used only 3 cups of chicken broth (the original would have called for 4 cups.) I did not have mushrooms on hand so I had to leave them out, as well as the chicken bouillon because I never use that. I loved the seasonings involved in this recipe, very yummy! I also left out the soup and just started the soup out with the original white sauce amounts called for in the recipe to compensate for no soup. ( I used 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup flour, 1 cup milk, some chicken broth and a splash of vinegar.) Instead of precooking my rice I just added in 1/3 cup uncooked rice in the soup and cooked it until done. To add some more substance I threw in about 1/2 cup or so uncooked egg noodles. Very yummy and great topped with Parmesan cheese! Quick and easy and a nice change from traditional chicken noodle soup; will make again.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Never any leftover when I make it, everybody loves it!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Really good although I did season it some more. Makes a huge lot so I hope this freezes well!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I didn't have Cream of Mushroom Soup on hand, so I used Cream of Chicken. Either would be delicious I'm sure. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This soup is wonderful! It's exactly what I was looking for. The only thing I did different was I added half and half. It made it a little more creamy. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I modified this recipe and left out the mushrooms because I don't care for them. I didn't have celery, so I added extra carrots. It turned out so yummy and flavorful! We ate it with a side of garlic toast. It's a very filling soup. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This was so easy and delicious! I used a rotisserie chicken so I had less prep. The cream of mushroom adds just enough to make the broth thicker and almost creamy, but still light. It is the perfect soup for a winter day.
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#Very nice recipe! Strong earthy mushroom and rice flavors, which I really enjoy!
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This soup was amazing! I don't like mushrooms, so I omitted them. I cooked the chicken and then used that broth to make the soup, it was super delicious! I am currently on Weight Watchers Points Plus and this is only 4 points per serving. Gonna make some to freeze for individual servings later! 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#This is one of the best wild rice soups to make. It enhances the flavor of the rice and doesn't get all mushy. This is also wonderful with ham, with ham and chicken or with smoked turkey. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#0#0#I made this and it is mmm...good. Next time I will make it without the white wine and just use the chicken broth. The wine made it tangy and took away from the flavors of chicken and earthy tone from the mushrooms. 
Chicken Wild Rice Soup#1#0#I made this soup for a church fundraiser and it was a hit. Very tasty and very good!! I am not fond of celery, so I substituted celery seed and it came out great. Loved it!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Delicious !!! A Saint Patty's Day favorite. Followed the recipe exactly except added 1 tsp. vanilla to the icing 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#5#2#I have made this many times with mixed results. The flavor is excellent - I only used Dutch processed cocoa, but sometimes it collapses in the middle and sometimes it doesn't. So . . . I now make it in a bundt pan and it's 100% successful. Whip the cream before making the frosting, but I usually just make a cream cheese frosting and whip it up well. I often add a heaping tablespoon of espresso powder to the cake batter as well. I love this cake - dense, smooth, and rich tasting. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#1#0#I don't bake often but this is recipe is a keeper. I baked this cake for my niece's 21st Birthday and the cake is delicious and the topping is fantastic! Everyone loved the cake. Easy to make and came out exactly like the picture. Will definitely make again. One thing the frosting was runny so I placed it in the freezer for about 30 minutes...while the cake baked. Once the cake cooled off I added the frosting. It was delish! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#1#0#So very disappointed. The cake sunk in the middle and had a crusty looking lighter color brown in the middle. I usually use a hand mixer on a low setting but this recipe said combine therefore I used a whisk until all was combined. I needed this for our Easter dinner. Now I need to go to the supermarket to buy a cake. I will cut it in pieces later to see if it tastes any good. I can't serve it as is. I am not too sure if I should even bother making the icing. This turned out to be an expensive cake re: the guinness beer that no one will drink. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#1#0#I made this for St. Patrick's Day. It is a moist cake but doesn't taste chocolatey at all. It tastes like beer. The frosting was quite runny so I added additional powdered sugar trying to thicken it up some but it didn't work. It stayed runny even after refrigerating. It tasted good though. I poured it over the cake. My husband liked it but he loves beer. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#1#0#This was a rich, dense cake that tasted good. The frosting recipe, as written, comes out thin and runny. It tasted good, but was not like the picture. If I make this again, I will try whipping the cream first, as others have suggested.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#1#0#Dry? Mine was moist & ever so tasty. Perhaps Judi over baked or her oven needs adjusted. I did reduce sugar to 1-3/4 C, but otherwise followed the recipe. Definitely on my again' list.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I am a very seasoned cook, make everything from scratch. Made just as written, cake sunk in middle and icing is like soup.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#2#1#I made these as cupcakes and they are very good and moist! I took the recommendation and cut the baking soda to 1 1/4 tsp. Cupcakes took about 12 minutes to cook. The icing is more of a challenge. I made it as directed and it was thin and soupy and just didn't seem right. I read another comment that said they mixed the heavy cream alone until it was stiff and folded it into the mixed cream cheese and powdered sugar. I would highly recommend using this method. I also added about a tablespoon of bailey's into the cream cheese and powdered sugar and it tasted great. I would recommend this recipe. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#1#0#I bake often and this is recipe is a keeper. The cake is delicious and the topping is fantastic!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#2#1#unfortunately i have to rate it before i can ask a question... sounds delicious and i want to make it, but what brand/kind of cocoa powder is everyone using? from reading up on cocoa powders, dutch seems to be the best/most flavorable, bug of course the most expensive. appreciate any feedback!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#1#1#I made this cake for my birthday celebration last week and, wow, it was a huge hit! Everyone raved about it. It was moist, rich and oh so yummy! After reading reviews for the frosting, I mixed a couple teaspoons of the cream with the cream cheese and sugar, whipped the remaining cream, then folded the two together. Perfection! Thanks again, TOH, for another fabulous recipe!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#AMAZING flavor. Rich and delicious. Made it for Christmas and everyone loved it.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#So delicious! The guinness gives this cake a rich chocolate flavor that we all loved. The cream cheese frosting was so good I saved the leftover for serving on other desserts.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I've made this for St. Patrick's Day a few different times and it always turns out moist and big hit with everyone! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#i made this cake for St. Paddy's day and everyone loved it! it was moist and so good. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Awesome cake. Love to make
Chocolate Guinness Cake#1#0#My guests loved the cake. Easy to make and came out exactly like the picture. Will definitely make again.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I love this cake and so does everyone else. I've made it twice and each time it sinks in the middle. No one has given me a reason. Would someone please tell me why it sinks and how to fix it. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Hi Debra,My guess would be your cocoa powder, different brands vary in color intensity. This recipe yields around 5 cups of batter, that should easily fit in a 9 springform pan.Hope this helps!Sue StetzelRecipe Support SpecialistTaste of Home Magazine 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Recipe was a complete success! I followed the it ~almost~ exactly. I substituted all-purpose-flour for cake flour. And I find doing personal sized cakes is much better. Took about 20 minutes for mini cakes in the oven. I also made my own cream cheese icing.They were ~very moist~, and surprisingly delicious! Much sweeter than I was expecting, which is fine because I LOVE SWEET!Next time I may make a ganache.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I made this cake and it was not what I expected or saw in the picture. It was not DARK and made way more then the recipe said. I used Guinness Stout beer but it did not come out dark and chocolate tasting(it was more like a gingerbread cake). It was good, but not what the picture looked like. What might have gone wrong?
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I made this for a St. Patrick's day dessert. It was easy to make and tasted pretty good. I think the Guinness beer took away some of the chocolate flavor, though. I used dark cocoa powder and still thought it lacked chocolate flavor. I would definitely add more cocoa powder and maybe some extra sugar to sweeten it up a bit. The texture was very moist, though, and my kids loved it! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#1#Very moist and tastes OK. Not sure I will make it again though. There is a strong flavor to the cake that I do not really like. Also, I had to add vanilla to the frosting. Otherwise, I didn't change anything. Perhaps it will taste better tomorrow...some things are like that! One thing I really liked about the recipe is that it is quick to make and I did not have to get out my big mixer. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Delicious! My husband & kids both agree!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Very good. Moist and rich. I replace half the cocoa powder with dark cocoa power. I didn't use this frosting recipe. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#4#0#When I visited Ireland I happened upon a slice of Dark Chocolate Guinness Cake. Soo Goood. Been looking for the recipe ever since I got back to the States. This one is great! First time I made it though was a flop. nothing but a sinkhole. (but still actually tasted great!) Saw lots of other people having the same issue. Cut back on the Baking Soda! 2nd time I only used 1-1/4tsp and it rose perfectly! And Don't use the wisk when adding in flour and baking soda. use a spoon and stir just until everything is all wet.I also like to give a bit of spice to my Cream Cheese frosting, add in some good cinnamon and ground ginger to give it a bit of extra kick. Won't be that perfect frosty white though. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Had this cake for St. Pat's day and it was so moist and the chocolate flavor was great!! Will be making this again and not just for St. Pat's!! Big hit! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#MAde this cake for St. Patrick's Day. The cake is absolutely wonderful. The recipe calls for 1 1/2 CUPS of powdered sugar, not POUNDS, as stated in a previous review. This is one of my go to cake recipes. Will make it again...and again...and again! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#2#1#The cake is great! I wish that the recipe would mention that the whipping cream should be whipped 1st. 1.5 pounds of powered sugar just doesn't make a nice frosting. Oh it spreads ok, but you can't taste the cream cheese. When it has a 4.5 star rating I didn't think I needed to read the reviews for tips. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Cake is easy and delicious. I made it in a bundt pan and it came out great!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This is a delicious cake and easy to make, too. I've made it twice for co-workers and it was thoroughly enjoyed both times. I was afraid there might be a strong beer flavor, but the beer only serves to deepen the chocolate flavor. The frosting is delicious as well. Wonderful cake! For the person whose cake fell: I think you may need to bake it longer. Try another 8 to 10 minutes. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Help! - I have made this twice following the recipe exactly and it falls in the middle each time. The cake is delicious but I can't serve it with the sunken middle. Any suggestions how to solve this problem? Thanks. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#One of the best, if not THE best chocolate cake I have ever had! Had a dinner party for 8 and everyone loved it! Served the leftovers at a tailgate the next day -- everyone loved it there as well!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This was great. It had a delicious chocolate taste that was really enhanced by the beer. I made it for a St Patricks day dinner and everyone loved it! To whiskeydrinkingcowgirl. A cake falls when the ingredients have not been mixed properly. I would make sure all the ingredients are well mixed.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#One of the best cakes I have ever made. And maybe the easiest recipes to follow (except the part about using a small saucepan - medium works better to handle all of the ingredients). I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe- it comes out great every time! And everyone loves it!! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#What more needs be said, this cake was incredible!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This cake is awesome! I also listened to the advice some gave and whipped most of the whipping cream to make the frosting fluffier and not so runny. It seems to make way too much for the cake though, so I dip plain cookies in the leftover frosting.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I've made this cake 3 times and it's fallen every time. Has it happened to you and do you have any advice how to keep it from falling? We love the cake and the frosting hides the hole in the middle. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#1#OMG this is a great cake! I don't bake much, but decided this looked easy and I had the Guinness anyway. Boy am I glad that I saw this recipe. Hubby asked if we could just make this enough that we have it to eat every day, all the time LOL I don't have a spring form pan, so I made it in a 8x8 and it turned out great. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Delicious ending to a fantastic St. Patty's day dinner of Guiness Corned Beef and Cabbage! Used a 9 in round cake pan and came out perfectly. Also didn't use the cream, used light cream cheese, and added vanilla to the frosting. Yum!! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I've made this for the last two St. Patrick's Days and it is great! I do the frosting a bit differently. I whip the cream separately. I also whip the cream cheese and sugar separately and then fold them in together. I add a bit of Baileys Irish Cream to the frosting too, delish! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I never review recipes, although TOH has so many! This cake is AWESOME!! Agree with recent reviewer: use a large saucepan as you add a lot of ingredients to it. Will make this every St. Patrick's Day! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Excellent!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Good.... but I think I prefer my Guinness Chocolate Cheesecake: http://thedipnchip.weebly.com/guinness-chocolate-cheesecake.html
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Made this into cupcakes so it was less time consuming for a cooking class in my Cooking School. Everyone loved them!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This Cake turned out moist and really tasty! The Guinness adds a subtlety to the flavor of the chocolate that makes it really shine.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This cake is moist and delicious! Great for St. Patrick's day! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#No way this recipe can continue in a small saucepan. I had to transfer contents to a laree casserole dish prior to adding the flour.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#1#OMG, I don't consider myself an experienced baker and am often intimidated by cake recipes, though I have tackled a few. I am also an instant gratification baker and involved, complicated, chemistry like bake goods scare me to death. I just finished this cake! Easy, Perfect and beautiful. Everyone loved it......really raved about it...think I will do another next week for Saint Patrick's day. Novice bakers take note, This cake will wow them. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#With all the terrific reviews, I probably don't need to convince you to try this recipe! After making it once, I have been asked to make this over and over. I don't mind doing so, since this cake is so easy and always a hit. If you have some homebrewed stout, this is a great use for it! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This is the best chocolate cake I have ever had! Wonderfully moist & not too sweet. It getS more most after a day or 2
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#By far one of the BEST cakes ever. Moist & flavorful....delicious.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#My adult son asked me to make this cake for his birthday. It's easy to make & it turned out fabulous. Everyone loved it. My husband says it's now his favorite cake too! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Really good! Easy! That's if you have Guinness handy!!! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#My husband couldn't wait for it to be done! It smelled great baking. I followed the recipe to a tee, and couldn't of been more satisfied with the outcome. This is definitely a keeper! ( Of course Guiness is my husband favorite beer helped a little. But taste was barely there). 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#My husband has been making this for 3-4 years thanks to Nigella Lawson! Her recipe was talked about on NPR and he tracked down the recipe. Love it!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#made this without any modifications and it was perfect and everyone wanted the recipe and seconds
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#FANTASTIC! Have made it several times & it is always a big hit with everyone...and so easy to make. Arranging the frosting is fun!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Served this cake for St. Pat' Day party...my husband tried to sneak a piece to take home but got caught and lost it to Marilyn!! It was very good! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#What a delicious cake, entire family and St. Patrick's Day guests LOVED it! So pleased! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Made this last year, but with canned cream cheese icing and was a hit. This year, I made plain vanilla icing and it was still great. Turns out so moist and so good.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#oops...I meant to say whipping cream in my previous post! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#OMG!!! This cake is awesome! Key to getting the frosting right is to make sure the whipping is really cold. Recommend putting in the freezer for about 15 mins before you use it. I will totally make this again! Enjoy!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I made the recipe as directed. The cake is moist as said in other reviews. I used a bundt pan for baking. My husband thought this cake was Devine. I love the fact this is an easy yummy cake!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This recipe was a nice surprise. The cake was moist and had a good balance of both chocolate and Guinness tastes. I also added half heavy cream and half baileys to the frosting but I think next time I will try something else. It was ok tasting but I didn't exactly love it either. Next time I think a little powdered sugar sprinkled on top may taste good all by itself, I don't think you really need the frosting at all. Thank you for this wonderful beer cake recipe! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This is a cake for special occasions. I have made it for birthdays, St. Patrick's Day and parties. Not only great reviews but requests for doggie bags to take some home. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I am not a cake lover but made this for company and it is but to die for. Nice and moist.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#For the frosting I would suggest whipping the cream first, doing so until stiff peaks appear. Remove to a chilled bowl and set in the fridge. Proceed with cream cheese and confectioner's sugar, then fold in chilled whipped cream. For flavor, add a touch of Bailey's. I also wonder how this would work if you omitted the cream cheese and confectioner's sugar and just whipped the heavy ceam, then added the Bailey's. Might be interesting! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I love this! I could eat the entire cake myself... Luckily nobody will let me because they loved it too!! MAKE THIS!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Since making this cake last year for St. Patrick's day it has become my signature cake. People love it, it's easy and always turns out well. I've taken to mixing Bailey's in the frosting, instead of 1/2 cup whipping cream I do a 1/4 of each. I'm making it again tomorrow for my mom's boss birthday, sans Bailey's since it will be enjoyed at school. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Cake was so good and stayed moist for days. Easy and quick recipe. Frosting tasted a little dull on its own (not sweet), but was perfect once on top of the cake. Hubby loved this and will be made again in our house!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Made this got great reviews, can't even taste the beer. It is so moist. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I've made this twice and both times it was excellent. I noticed some comments on the icing being a bit runny. I didn't have heavy whipping cream so I used half and half creamer, and I just added a few tables spoons at a time until I got the right consistency. It was probably about 1/3 of a cup more or less. The half and half worked great and I got the right consistency with less than the recipe calls for. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#We served it to company, and it was a hit! We (in the kitchen) got to lick the serving utensils - that is all that was left of it!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#It is a challenge to bake long enough, but not overbake and cause cake to dry out. Otherwise our family liked this cake. Made it for our St. Pat's day meal and my son thought a little Bailey's to the topping would have been great. I liked the cake as is. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#easy to make, interesting ingredients and directions for the cake and frosting. The cake is dense and moist with a slight bitter quality from the beer. It is not overly sweet and the frosting is perfect.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Loved this! This was one heck of a moist, dense, chocolate cake! Thanks!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Super easy cake to make but the frosting was too runny to create froth. Enjoyed the cake very much the first day but really dried out in the fridge overnight (and I had it wrapped in plastic wrap). Disappointing overall.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#One of the best cakes I've ever made! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This is definitely a keeper! The cake is so moist it almost doesn't need frosting! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I made this recipe into an Irish car bomb cake it was amazing. I added Jamison and baileys to the frosting!!! Very yummy!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This cake is amazing! If you're looking for a healthier but equally delicious version of this cake though, be sure to check it out: http://applepiefromscratch105.wordpress.com/ 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Love it! Moist and delicious. I added a cap of Irish creme liqueur to the icing recipe just to add a tinge of color and it taste AMAZING!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I made it into 2 dozen cupcakes. The batter makes the perfect amount for 2 dozen and there is plenty of frosting. Very nice Guinness undertone with the chocolate :) Yum!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This was a good, dense cake. The surprise on my family's faces when I told them the secret ingredient was priceless! Thanks for sharing! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Easy and delicious!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#best chocolate cake I've ever had! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I baked this cake for my husband to take to work for his office meeting. He called and told me Hands down, my favorite cake you've ever made. He also told me everyone in the office loved it too. I can't wait to try it now! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#best
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Very moist cake. Has a hint of the Guinness Stout flavor. Great cake to celebrate Irish!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#OMG This is the best chocolate cake I've had since my mom's Black Midnight Cake which was much harder to make. Excellent! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I have had so many requests - it's moist, the frosting is not too sweet - everyone raves about it. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This is amazing! And don't worry if you don't like Guinness or dark beers like that. The beer adds a great flavor to the cake without being overpowering. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#The cake s very moist. Topping is a little runny and you don't need as much as recipe makes. but very good. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Cake was not very exciting. I had hoped that the Guinness would make it unique and interesting, but it was really not at all noticeable.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#1#0#A very nice chocolate cake. The beer doesn't loom large in the overall flavor. I used 1 cup sour cream instead of 2/3 cup, which may have made it a bit more moist. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I have made this 6 or 8 times and every time it has turned out fabulous. Not sure why some people have had such bad luck making it. It is the best cake I have ever made!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Excellent!!! My husband hates chocolate cake but LOVES this cake! It is best when made the day before serving and kept in the fridge so the flavors can blend. The first time I made it we served it still a little warm and you couldn't taste the Guinness but the next day when my husband and I had another slice it was so much better because the flavors had blended. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Very moist cake; made using a cupcake pan without cupcake papers then and topped with strawberries and ganache using 6oz of semi-sweet choc & 1 cup heavy whip cream melted in pan. I then hand dipped each cupcake and served in a cupcake foil. Looked and tasted awesome!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#LOVE this cake!! Oh my goodness! I have made it quite a few times and every time I do, I am asked for the recipe!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Great taste. My husband requested it again for this weekend so I'll be making it today. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This cake was fantastic and so moist. I could eat the frosting alone. It was so good!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Can I substitute Pepsi/Coca Cola for the beer?
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I made this for my wifes birthday. It was great! I used a bundt pan, but didn't prepare it well enough and it sort of fell apart, so we ate that one and made another one which came out nice. YUM Yum. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I have an 87 year old friend who told me several years ago that every birthday she and her brother would ask for a similar cake as a special treat.? Her mother made them.? She said she no longer had a recipe for a beer cake.? When I saw this, I decided I have to make one for her.? We are going on a retreat soon and I am going to surprise her with this cake.?
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Fantastically moist cake with yummy icing. I have a bottle of Guinness waiting to be made into another cake (if only I had the sour cream on hand!).
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This was a hit at out campclub potluck.My husband has now chosen this cake to be his birthday cake. I didn't really taste beer (I don't care for beer), just deep, dense chocolate cake. The icing was perfect too. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Was very moist and yummy. My family loved it.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Very moist! Everyone loved it and could not believe how moist it was. It disappeared in one day!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This cake was horribly dry and the worst cake I've ever made. I'm known for making great cakes and I am so glad I didn't have to take it somewhere. I felt terrible that I had to throw it away. And I followed the recipe exactly.. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I served this to a group of friends and they all said it was to die for and wanted the recipe!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Not a good cake for children, the taste of the Guinness was a bit too strong.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This is basically the old Texas sheet cake (baked in a bundt pan instead of the cookie sheet) and it can be made using cola (like Coke or Pepsi) or Dr Pepper. It can also be make using water. I know the beer will give the cake a malty flavor but the water or soda will work too.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#YUM! That's all I need to say.To the folks needing an alternate to the beer, the beer is what makes this cake so moiste and flavorful. Sorry. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#make a chocolate ganache to drizzle over the top by (6oz semisweet chips, melted & 1 cup heavy cream melted on the stove)...the cake recipe is beyond words, the best cake I've ever had. so dense & just a hint of guiness. my husband has already asked for this to be his birthday cake...in July! :) 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I think that white icing is WAAAYY too sugary sweet. If you're looking for something more decadant...make a chocolate ganache: 6oz semi-sweet chocolate chips & 1 cup heavy cream, simmer both together & melt the chips, pour it over the completely cooled cake = amazing! Serve it with some sliced, fresh strawberries...friends will BEG you for the recipe! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#My family loved this cake. It wasn't to chocolate for them. I didn't add the cream to the frosting and it was just right. Yes it is a thick and heavy but they liked it.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I can not use the beer is there anything I can use instead?
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Loved the cake! Very moist and the frosting was wonderful. Used a bundt cake pan, and it turned out perfect.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Loved the cake - made it without frosting and it was decadent and rich. Just has a hint of malt flavor from the Guinness. This cake is going to be a new addition to our yearly March menu for sure. Twelve servings makes for a very large piece of very rich cake - I think you could get at least 18 servings. I've also seen this cake with a peanut butter cream cheese frosting - and that sounds yummy. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Absolutely loved this cake, as did the people I served it to. I did make a few low-fat adjustments. Used low-fat sour cream, low-fat cream cheese and light butter. The frosting was awesome on this cake. This is a keeper
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This cake is beyone words! It is sooo Delicouse and addicting ; ) This cake will definetly be made in our house again and again!!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#What's not to love? Guinness + chocolate = YUM! It was great, we love it! says my 6 yr old. The cake came out perfect, great crispy edges, and the frosting was a nice compliment, although just as good without it. Will definitely make this again! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This cake was not moist at all. I was very disappointed. Thick,heavy and kinda hard.I cooked it only 40 minutes. I liked the frosting.The cake had a good flavor,not to sweet. I could't serve this until I could figure out what went wrong. Sorry!!!! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#cake was too thick and heavy. frosting was very thin; kept adding more 10x but couldn't make it'frothy-looking'. didn't like flavor. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Made it last night on a whim (had some dark beer in the fridge similar to Guinness) -- delicious! I cut the sugar some and added a handful of dark chocolate chips. I didn't make the frosting -- it is delicious on its own and VERY moist! WILL make again! :) 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I can't wait to try this! I read over the reviews and see that some of the reviewers seem to be worried about the alchohol content. It cooks out...it's there for flavor. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#My family says this is the best cake they have eaten in years!!!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I wanted to make it, but with 3 1/2 cups of sugar and the high fat content (heavy whipping cream and cream cheese), I have to pass
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Delicious, moist and perfect with frosting.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#non-alcholic beer (e.g. KALIBERfrom the brewers of Guinness) work the same as it's alcholic buddies? 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Very moist and dense...yum! Didn't really taste the Guinness, though. So easy to make! 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I made the cupcakes which called for milk in the frosting - too runny - next time it will be the cake. Everyone said, Best cupcakes I have ever had! Great for March 17th!!! A+ 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I made this for St. Patrick's Day and everyone loved it! Very moist and it was even better the next day after it had been refridgerated. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Really enjoyed this cake. Very easy to make and makes fairly fast. Did it for a family gathering and everybody enjoyed it. The guinness gives it a lovely kick. I didn't have a springform pan so I used a bundt pan and it came out PERFECT!! Will make it again and again. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This is so easy and with it's dense consistency and exceptional flavor it will be a favorite for serving guests. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Is there a substitute for the beer? Thanks
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This cake was delicious!! And so easy to make.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#This is the best chocolate cake I ever tasted. I love the crunchy edge. Excellent!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Moist and not too sweet. The frosting is truly the icing onthe cake 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Made this for a family get together and it was a hit! I took home an empty plate.*Note that the beer should be included with the cake ingredients rather than the topping ingredients.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#I baked this last night and served it while still warm. Delicious. My mother said she loved it more without the icing. I will make this again next week! Absolutely delicious.
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Loved the frosting, I made the cake in a bundt pan and it looked beautiful:) Moist with good, albeit somewhat mild, flavor. Easy to make and frost. Lots of requests for the recipe!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Very good. It is moist and fairly dense. The icing sets if off and compliments the chocolate. There is just a hint of the Guinness in it so you know it isn't just your ordinary chocolate cake. I would make it again. 
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#so excited to try this recipe looks delicious!
Chocolate Guinness Cake#0#0#Any ideas for non-alcoholic substitute for the beer in this recipe? 
White Bean Chicken Chili#2#0#no pin symbol to save
White Bean Chicken Chili#20#3#I have made this recipe for years. My changes are to roast the chicken breasts, dice into 1/4 inch chunks, add crème-cheese, butter and use canned green chilis vice the jalapeno. I also do not use cumin. I have won several chili cook-offs with my recipe! :)
White Bean Chicken Chili#15#2#I would not slow cook chicken breast for several hours though...no point, saute for 5 minutes and add to the beans at the end and leave for about 5 minutes to cook through. Otherwise a nice change from the usual, I had a similar dish in Arizona and it was surprisingly good....... 
White Bean Chicken Chili#9#6#Hi! Is this recipe Gluten Free (as long as I don't use flour to thicken)? 
White Bean Chicken Chili#8#1#very good! This is a make again recipe
White Bean Chicken Chili#18#2#Absolutely delicious! I made it exactly as written. My husband loves it! I serve it with a dollop of plain non fat Greek yogurt, which almost tastes like sour cream, and a little shredded cheddar on top.
White Bean Chicken Chili#7#65#I made this a bit healthier by using spaghetti squash instead of noodles. Added mushrooms to the meat mixture as well. It was delicious!
White Bean Chicken Chili#17#3#This is my favorite white chicken chili. The only thing I do is add another can of beans that I drain and mash to give it a little more thickness. I top the bowls with a little shredded sharp cheese, a dollop of sour cream, chopped and seeded jalapeno.
White Bean Chicken Chili#23#4#Great recipe. Very easy to make with raw chicken or leftover rotisserie chicken. Follow the recipe. Ignore Pam, hers is not the recipe in question.
White Bean Chicken Chili#31#4#It's a great recipe. People who want to change the recipe then write it on your reviews should get their own web page. You're supposed to be rating this recipe not your own. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#16#1#Very tasty recipe - thank you for sharing! It can be easily modified with a few ingredients to people's tastes, but I like it as is. Not sure what Pam was doing to this recipe - but looks like she should have just thrown it out completely and added all her silly ingredients to plain chicken stock and wrote her own recipe; rather than destroying yours - lol! 
White Bean Chicken Chili#2#0#This was very good. I love beans. This was easy and flavorful.
White Bean Chicken Chili#3#71#This is a very good recipe, BUT. I changed a few things. here is what I did & it turned out DELICIOUS . 2pds of skinless chicken, 5 cups of broth ( I use Better Than Bouillon Chicken Flavored its in a jar. LOVE THIS STUFF) , 1.5 Cup of heavy whipping cream, 4 stalks of celery, 1 small sweet onion, 3 teaspoons of minced garlic, 1 tea. cumin, 2 tea. oragano, 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese, salt & pepper, 5 cans of northern kidney beans, boiled chicken, shredded the chicken, added everything in crock pot, then added INSTANT MASH POTATOES ( it works GREAT on thicken the sauce, plus great taste) sprinkle some in, stir, thickens instantly, I just judge the thickness. cover & cook on high for 3 hrs. it makes a lot, so I'm sure I will be sharing with family or freezing some. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#3#0#A very easy and excellent recipe. It's not going to be that thick chili-consistency, but the heat level is nice and kid-friendly as advertised. I made a few slight alterations: I used about 1 lb of chicken and 1 additional can of beans, since we like our chilies and soups on the chunkier side. I reduced the broth to 2 cups and used liquid from the canned beans when I crushed the 1/2 cup of beans as directed - though I did this with a fork, so it wasn't perfectly smooth. The flavors are a nice blend, although I think I will increase the oregano and cumin to compensate for having more chicken and beans next time. The additions of cheese, avocado, and cherry tomatoes are delicious, and oyster crackers are good, too. My very picky son ate seconds - unprompted! Definitely a winner in my book! 
White Bean Chicken Chili#2#4#It was ok. Since some commented it was more soup than chili, I did add more chicken. I didn't adjust any of the spices so maybe that's why it seemed a little bland. Even with the extra chicken there was way more onion than I ever care to have. It reeked of onion when I lifted the lid. Maybe this is a good base to start off at, but I wouldn't make it as written again. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#3#0#Easy recipe, it tasted really good. Excellent flavor. My only issue was that it was more soup than chili, which many other reviewers said. It would be nice if it were quite a bit thicker. Then I would have given it 5 stars. I did really like it, and I will probably monkey with the recipe some more.
White Bean Chicken Chili#3#0#We love white chili!! This recipe is one of the best. The favors come right through!! We will fix this again and again!!
White Bean Chicken Chili#3#0#I made this last year an forgot to say how GREAT this is!. I doubled it as she does, an I did not see the need for the cheese which makes it low fat. More of a soup texture which is fine an it has a wonderful flavor. Followed the recipe as I always do the first time I make it, an will not make any changes. Easy an excellent!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Excellent, easy to follow recipe. We really enjoyed it and will definitely make it again.
White Bean Chicken Chili#1#0#We really enjoyed the flavor of this dish. It was a little more like soup than chili but that did not bother us. I will definitely make this again. Super fast and tasty meal!
White Bean Chicken Chili#3#0#My family says they did not enjoy this recipe but I thought it was mighty tasty. My husband and two boys only ate a couple spoonfuls but I finished two bowls without a problem.
White Bean Chicken Chili#1#0#My family of four loved this dish. My nine year said it tasted like a chicken burrito and gave it a ten! I think I will double the recipe next time so we will have enough left over for an easy weeknight dinner. ??
White Bean Chicken Chili#4#1#This is a very good recipe for white chili. It is a little thin and more like soup when made exactly as written. I substitute a cup of heavy whipping cream for one of the cups of chicken broth which gives it a very creamy and thicker sauce. I've used chicken I've cooked myself, canned chicken and rotisserie chicken at different times and all of them work well in the recipe. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#2#0#I've been making this for quite a while now. I put my chicken in a bowl and stir in the spices. I let it set for about 15 minutes so the chicken absorbs the flavors of the spices. That's the only change I made. It's delicious!! 
White Bean Chicken Chili#1#0#Very good. It was a bit runny and I will probably mash another can of beans for thickening and maybe add a can of chopped green chiles next time. All in all we loved it.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#The consistency is much too loose to be considered chili. Will add cornstarch in order to thicken next time. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#3#0#Awesome, the only change I made was to add a small can of diced green chilies.
White Bean Chicken Chili#4#0#I have made this over and over. I absolutely love it and follow the recipe or double. It's amazingly good ! I do use a Rotisserie Chicken a lot of the time, either way it is DELISH and always a hit. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#2#0#Very good. I also added cornstarch and water the last 30 minutes to thicken.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Delicious. I added a bit of corn starch to thicken it. A hit with my husband too. Thanks for sharing!
White Bean Chicken Chili#1#1#This was pretty good. I only used 21/2 c. Of broth because of the soupy comments. Seemed like a good ratio. I didn't detect any spiciness off of this and neither did my 7yr old. So, if you want it spicy, I suggest using some seeds or some Serrano chilies. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#This chili has really good flavor. It's a little soupy. I ended up having to strain out some of the broth and mash all the stuff together, though not to a pulp... I added tomatillos diced up in it. I used a poblano pepper instead of a jalapeno which is an idea if you want a mellow spiciness rather than a sharp spiciness. So other than it being soupy, pretty awesome. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I used a 4 qt dutch oven covered in a 300 degree oven for about an hour and a half to cook. Then I added masa harina (corn flour) to thicken it up a bit. Just 1/4 cup or so mixed with 1/2 a cup of water to make a paste during the last 15 minutes of cooking. Move the pan to the top of the stove to better monitor the chili towards the end. I thought it was pretty good.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Cooking for two so cut recipe in half. Used canned chilies. It was excellent!
White Bean Chicken Chili#1#0#I used a can of green chilies instead of fresh jalapenos. Eliminated the sour cream and cheese. The family loved it.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#1#I have been making this recipe for many years. I mash 1 can of beans with some broth and add 2 additional cans drained beans to the soup. It seems to give it the right consistency for a chili. I add chopped canned jalapeno depending on who I am serving (kids- no jalapeno). I put out bowls of toppings for each person to select their own such as crushed baked tortilla chips, chopped avocado, chopped tomato, cheddar cheese, and sour cream. This is the most delicious soup and my family requests it even in the summer!!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Love this recipe!!! It is more of a soup than chili but who cares...it is delicious! My hubby loves this (even the leftovers). You have to try it!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I did not add as much broth added some white wine for extra flavor and a can of crushed tomatoes to give it that chili flavor. It was great.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Need to leave the jalapeno out when the kids are here. Otherwise it was great!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#This has great flavor but chili is misleading. It is more like a soup with a chili flavor. I did add a second can of beans mashed to give it a bit more thickness and my son and I like a little more heat so, I used all of the jalepeno pepper, seeds and all. Very tasty and nice for a cold night. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#1#0#I doubled it to fit better in my 5 quart slow cooker. Great without jalapeno peppers. I used a 6 ounce container of diced peppers & onions from the grocery store. YUM!
White Bean Chicken Chili#1#0#This was more of a soup to me. Maybe I will try again with an extra can of beans mashed to thicken. Needs a little more something. But, it is a great base to start with and make your own.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I love this! Made a big batch and am going to take it for lunch all week! Healthy, yummy, and you can control the spice.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#delicious and simple
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I am not a chili eater but I love this recipe. When i am short of time, I use canned chicken and just put everything in the crockpot without cooking the chicken first. When I have time, I would cook the chicken beforehand; I do think this gives the chili more flavor. But either recipe tastes good.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#This was a real winner! I submitted this chili as part of a chiliccook off and beat the other 13 entries! Everyone loved it.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Super yummy!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Really yummy! Great hearty chili for winter.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#This was wonderful! I used my Emersion blender just before serving to thicken it up! Yum!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#My family found this soup ok , but not one of our favorites. Will keep looking for a chicken chili recipe that hits the ball out of the park. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Served at a Realtor's luncheon, Everyone loved it! 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#i made this without the jalapeno since my granddaughter doesn't like anything too spicy. After serving her I added about 1/3 cup medium spice green chilies, otherwise the chili was too bland for our tastes. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Chili was too runny. Add some flour or corn starch to thicken it.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I don't know if it was just me, but mine was more like a thin chicken soup than a chunky chili like I was expecting. It did taste good and my family enjoyed it, but I probably won't be making again. I have other similar recipes that I prefer more. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Perfect recipe for anyone on a dairy free-gluten free diet. Really tasty! I used frozen precooked chicken the first time I made it to save on time.
White Bean Chicken Chili#1#0#Loved this chicken chili! I did substitute a roasted chicken for the chicken breast as I was in a hurry, and it was FAB! Doubled the recipe and ate it for a week! Kids, husband, everyone loved it. Great recipe!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#This was really good. I omitted the cheese and sour cream and served it with cornbread. Mmmm.
White Bean Chicken Chili#1#0#So good! I also added another can of beans and that helped to thicken it. I also used just rotisserie chicken and added it at the end. We topped the dish with a little Mexican shredded cheese, sour cream, cilantro, and hot green salsa. Cornbread on the side!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#This dish had a great flavor and was easy to make, but I ended up with more of a soup than a chili. Next time I make it, I'm using 3/4 of the suggested liquids and I'm making it on the stove rather than in the crockpot so it has a chance to simmer down a bit. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#One of my favorites! I make this all the time. My dad is a very picky eater and he even eats this. Highly recommended!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#This recipe was very good. We ate it with biscuits, so we didn't mind that it was a little soupy. It was not as spicy as many chilies, but had an excellent blend of flavors. Yum! 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Hey guys, I am in the planning stage of attempting this recipe in my crock pot. I was wondering how much should I increase the ingredients of the recipe by if I wanted to fill a 5qt crock put? Should I double the recipe?
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#1#I can see why this recipe is contest winning! I followed the original poster's suggestion about doubling and adding an extra can of beans and it is extremely good. I have made this for guests and they always want the recipe. We have this at least once a month, but I could eat it every week. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I doubled this and used 1 can of black beans in place of the kidney beans. I also cooked chicken tenderloins and then shredded them before I added them to the chili. Served it with cheesy Italian monkey bread. The flavor was GREAT!!! My only complaint was that with the broth, it was a thinner consistency than what I was hoping for, and I guess I didn't mash my beans enough to make it thicker. Otherwise we really liked it!!!! 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#My stars aren't showing up, but I give it 2*. Too thin and soupy to call it a chili in my book. And as previous reviewers said, it's lacking something. Maybe a little acidity (lime juice)? I won't bother with this recipe again. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#This was the perfect crock pot chili recipe for game day. I doubled it and added a can of beans. It was still a little on the soupy side so I will add more chicken next time. It needs more than 3 1/2 hours to cook for the chicken and onions to get good and tender. I would recommend 6 hours in the slow cooker.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Too soupy. Needs more flavor.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Make with a few modifications to make it a little thicker and spicier since our family likes spicy.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I was expecting something thicker.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Followed the recipe - seeded the jalapeno and added 1 pickled (from the jar). It was SO amazing! My kids even ate it! This will be a new monthly dinner!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#My husband loved this recipe...will definately make it again.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#This has become one of my go to recipes for cool weather. It's delicious, tastes just as good heated up and just an overall killer recipe. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I love this chili. The only change I made was to add a jalapeno with the seeds. My brother-in-law was asking me the other day to make that soup meaning chili that has the white beans. Ha! So I guess I'll make it again. Thank you. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#it turned out really good--i may have added to much broth but still really good
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I found this recipe to be lacking something, so I threw in a few extra things and it turned out pretty well. I used only 1/4 tsp oregano, instead of 4 garlic cloves I used garlic powder, I also added a handful of spinach, and some wild rice. I added a little of a seasoning blend, and added fresh ground pepper.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Like the pervious reviews, I left the seeds in the jalapeno to turn up the heat (which really worked well). However, I agree with the review regarding flavor leakness. I will make the chili again but with a few changes to kick-up the flavor. I added more salt and pepper to taste, as well as lime juice (1 fresh). I perfer my chili thick, so I also thicken the chili. I added a mix of wide rice, as well. Yum. Next time I will add more beans and lime juice, and the wild rice.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#SOOO good. I will for sure be doubling next time. It was very flavorful and it satisfied my guests!! Perfect for a cold day!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#The recipe just seemed to lack a little something. I will Tyrone more time but next time I'm roasting my peppers. It will probably intensify the flavor and it won't seem like it is not fully cooked. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#We make this recipe frequently. It's a classic and guests always love it. For a little more flavor, I leave the seeds in the jalepeno. I usually always double the recipe to feed six adults. We prefer the cannellini beans because they're larger and softer. We love to serve it with cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Amazing. Everyone at my small group asked me for the recipe.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Wow, my husband told me that it is the best chili he had! I am very happy!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#This one was a hit with my boyfriend and our kids. Everyone was asking for more. I think I'll double the recipe next time so we have enough to take to work for lunch. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I've used this recipe a number of times and it is always a crowd pleaser. It is packed with protien and perfectly filling. I add 1 cup of cooked brown rice and 1 can of mexicorn (you can find it at most grocery stores, its a mix of corn and red and green bell peppers). I usually double the recipe because it is so popular and when I do, I like to sub out one of the cans of white kidney bean (left whole) with a can of red kidney beans for some more color. These modifications keep it healthy as well as add a little more hardiness to the dish. I will always have this one in my recipe box! LOVE IT! 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Very easy to make! I did not use the jalapenos or cilantro, but it was still absolutely tasty and filling! My husband IS NOT a bean person and he loved it! which says a lot, since he only likes meat and cheese! I would definitely make this again!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#My mother and I both pulled this recipe this past year -- and it has become a favorite! We both make it with homemade bread and everyone loves it!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Absolutely wonderful and so easy to make!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#This was very good. I reduced the chicken broth amount to a bit over a cup and used a white chicken chili boxed mix. It was devoured by our fellowship.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#This is just wonderful. Chili probably is the best description. I would describe it as a great comfort soup. The flavor is awesome like you're eating a hot liquid chicken and bean burrito! Sounds weird, but that's what it is. I accidentally only bought one can of beans not remembering that the recipe called for 2, so I threw in a can of corn to fill it up and it was so great, I would do that every time. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#1#0#I added a jar of hot salsa, and 1 can of chicken broth, and it was yummy!! With the jar of hot salsa, we didn't have to add the jalapenos. A friend of mine down here in the south suggested it, as that's how her mom makes it! We also used Blue Runner beans,...they are creamier, not whole. We kicked up the spices a little bit more, but the basic recipe is great!! 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I was not very impressed with the flavor or the thin chicken broth. It was fair. Hoping for more flavor because of the spices but maybe I just don't care for white chicken chili. I would think they would all be similar. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I doubled the recipe for Superbowl, threw in some roasted corn and a 12oz jar of light Alfredo sauce. Made it thicker and creamier.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#After all the 5 star reviews I expected more. It was easy and tasted good but it wasn't some amazing recipe. I would make it again but I am not putting it on my regular dinner menu. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I used Serrano chili's instead because that is what I had on hand. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I like to add some fresh squeezed lime juice into the chili right before serving.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#My husband and I loved this recipe! I would not change anything about it and will make it many times.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#My husband works evenings so I cook on the weekend for the whole week. This was so easy and sooo delicious! I got to have a small bowl before he took the WHOLE POT to work to share with his co-workers! He gave me the message they want more!!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I just made this today. I used a little over a pound of chicken breast, 2 cans of cannellini beans and about 10 oz of great northern beans. I added about a cup more chicken broth as well to compensate for the extra chicken. I didn't have jalapenos so I added a 7oz can of diced jalapenos when I was cooking the chicken. Terrific reheated as well. We topped ours with Monterey Jack. This was a hit at our house on this cold snowy day. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Atlanta is iced in and my husband is saying Not chicken again! but he really liked this recipe. Didn't have jalapeno pepper so added diced tomato w/jalapeno peppers. Put beans in blender to crush - used 1 can - would double amount next time to try to make thicker. Didn't have time to slow cook. Cooked on stove for 30 minutes and ate with garlic Asiago bread. Yumm! 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I made this for the first time last night and my husband told me it was definitely a keeper! I enjoyed it as well, having big chunks of white chicken that I could feed my two year old was great as well! Thanks!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Very good, if you like it a little thicker ad just a little potato flakes, turned out great!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I added extra chicken, and did not do the pepper as I wasn't sure if my kids would like it. I pureed 1 can of the white beans and added a large can of kidney beans. It would've been good to put a can of black beans, too. This dish has plenty of protein, gluten free. You can use plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and it tastes better with raw cheddar cheese. Last thing I did was not put it on low for 3 hrs, rather I put my crockpot on high. It made the chicken very tender. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#We loved this! I used home cooked beans and put more in. Also used canned geen chilis. We wanted enough for leftovers so doubled every thing except all the liquid. Delicious!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Making again tonight, my husband loved this and I didn't think he would! 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#My husband has banned me from calling this Chili but rather soup. I doubled everything in the recipe for my larger slowcooker and then cut out 1 cup of liquid. It still came out soupy and I think I would cut out another cup next time. Stille very good for a cold day when all you want is soup ready right when you get home. If you like things spicer don't seed the chili and add more. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#This is so yummy! The great thing is, you can make it on the stove or in a crock pot!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#very good, cooked in crock pot.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#It was good. It wasnt as thick as I liked it to be but good.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#very good
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#This recipe was easy and very tasty.The family loved it.The next tine I think I am going to add potatoes and some carrots as it is cooking.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I have always loved white chicken chili but this was my first try at making it. It is a small recipe that really serves 3 large servings instead of 6. I made the following changes to just about double it. I used 2 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 1 tsp of salt, 1 tbls pepper, 1 med. onion, 1 small can mild green chilis, 3 tsps dried oregano, 2 tsps ground cumin, 4 cans white kidney beans, 4 cups of chicken broth, 3/4 cup shredded cheddar and 3/4 cup shredded pepper jack. Everything else in the recipe I left the same. Cilantro is super important in this recipe as it pulls all the flavors together. If you try it without, I think it's kind of bland. Love, love, love this stuff! 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#It was devoured at our fellowship. I quadrupled most of the ingredients except for the broth, using only 1 box and used 4 cans of Progresso beans, and 12 oz. of cheese. I served it with tortilla strips. Very good and mildly spicy. June, 2018 I didn't have cumin but put in Trader Joe's taco seasoning, chili powder & paprika to taste. 2 cups chicken broth was too soupy; put in 3/4 cup instant mashed potato flakes & 3 cans of beans. Tastes okay to me, no fellowship verdict yet. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Both my picky eaters loved it. My husband loved it. We'll make it again. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I added more broth and threw in about 2 cups of cooked rice. It was delicious! Just enough zip of the pepper without being spicy.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Very easy to make and tasty!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Yummy! A very easy and healthy dish. It was more soupy than I like so I pureed a cup of beans and and added it back to the chili. I also used a roasted garlic broth and additional seasonings to kick it up. I will be making this again very soon!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#A family favorite!! My son asks over and over to make this. Wonderful flavor!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#This is delicious and so easy to make. I didn't use sour cream or cilantro. You can also omit the cheese and it is still great. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Tasty!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#In the last 2mo I have already made this recipe 3times. So good and easy to make, I love it on the cold days. I have passed this recipe onto several ppl already ;-)
White Bean Chicken Chili#1#0#This recipe has a great blend of flavors!! The only deviations I made were to use 1lb of chicken & I omitted the salt & instead sprinkled the meat with pepper & Greek Seasoning (only because my Mom is watching her salt intake). I too noticed my consistency was more along the lines of a soup . I know I'll make this one again & think next time I'll follow the recommendation of the recipe submitter & add an extra can of beans & maybe a 1.5lb of chicken. Thank you for posting the recipe, it's a definite keeper! 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I will make this again for the flavor was very good. I gave it only four stars instead of 5 because I thought it was a little too soupy. I think when I make it again I will add an extra can of beans and probably a pound of chicken. Overall though this recipe is very good.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Fantastic! Super easy to make and very flavorful!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I used chicken stock instead of broth.....I think it gave more richness to the recipe.
White Bean Chicken Chili#1#0#My husband and I found this recipe to be delicious, better each time it was warmed up (although it didn't last that long)! Adding the cheese and sour cream really enriches the taste! I will definitely be making this again and again! 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I threw all of the ingredients in the crock pot. You can't get an easier and it tastes great. I will use it again. In regards the WW question - there is nothing bad in the recipe. I agree that it wouldn't be more than 5 points per serving. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#is the nutrtional content available?
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I make this regularly, my whole family loves it. I have made it for company and it goes over very well. Regarding the Weight Watchers question, I also was on WW and figured the point value to be 5 pts per serving without cheese and sour cream.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#We loved this recipe. I knew it was a hit when my 5 year old said he wanted more....Thank you!!!
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#I'd like the nutritional information also....the recipe sounds great. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#Do You know what the calorie count and the fat count would be? I am on Weight Watchers diet, but this sounds really awesome.
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#This is a fantastic and simple recipe...everyone always raves about it. I double the pepper cause we like it spicy and serve with a bit of pepper jack cheese on top-a dollap of light sour cream is divine too
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#My recipe for White Chili is very similar and I use the canned green chilis.  I don't think they add as much heat. My recipe calls for a bag of Navy Beans and I use 1/2  of the small can of green chilis.  I hope this helps. 
White Bean Chicken Chili#0#0#What's a good substitute for the jalapeno? 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#2#1#Made a double batch for picky step children and they loved them. I used corn and flour shells. The corn shells seemed much spicier but still good. I served these with cilantro lime rice however plain rice was preferred by others. I even subribed to Taste of Home after making this hoping for more success recipes!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#12#1#Really delicious recipe. I didn't change a thing. I used homemade salsa and home canned jalapenos. My gosh, this was on par with anything you could order at a Mexican restaurant. 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#17#5#I don't usually do reviews but I made this but doubled for my BIG family! And OMG! Absolutely the easiest and best dish! Everyone loved it!!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#17#0#I have been trying new recipes to ease the boredom of Covid Lockdown. This recipe was an enormous hit with both my husband and me. The ease of prep in an added bonus. Thank you Kristi Black for sharing your superb recipe!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#11#0#Delicious! Add a bit of enchilada sauce to sour cream on top for a creamier bite. My boyfriend loved it!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#35#1#Super yum. I'm 14 and it was easy for me to follow and make myself. 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#7#0#Very easy! Used flour tortillas and two- 8in square pans and worked great. I fit five enchiladas in each pan perfectly and each were filled generously. 10/10 will make again.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Very simple to prep. Tasty! ??
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#2#0#Simple. Tasty. And best of all our kids loved it!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#5#1#I searched for an easy chicken enchilada recipe, and after making this one I know I found a recipe I'll use over and over again. I'm making it for the second time this week. The only change I made is to use a store bought rotisserie chicken and it turned out perfectly. Thanks for the recipe!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#1#0#This was fantastic. I doubled the cream cheese to 8 oz and used red enchilada sauce (recipe did not specify). So good. This will become a recipe we go to again and again. Heavenly.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#My child ate this!!!!! Thank you!!! We all loved it. The cream cheese added a nice creamy touch!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#I used warmed corn tortillas for improved flavor. Ended up using tomatillo salsa which was what I had on hand. This is a very easy and versatile recipe. Family loved it!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#2#2#Second time i have made this. The first time i followed directions. This time i made a double batch. If you make a double batch watch out you are going to have a lot. So this time i followed directions but i also put a half of red onion small can of chopped olives. about a cup of Mexican cheese. About a half of cup of sour cream. And lastly about 5 oz of green enchilada sauce in the pot mixed it up and cooked it for about 15 minutes. Then followed directions for the rest of the recipe. Ended up with 3 16 by 9 and one 13 by 9. Great and simple recipe
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#1#1#This was really good but I made a few changes.... I bought a 19 ounce can of enchilada sauce instead of a 10 ounce can. I used about 16 ounces of it. I added a clove of minced garlic to the salsa
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#1#0#Delicious! I followed recipe except didnt add beans because I didnt have them. Used hot salsa and refried beans as the bottom layer. I made a bit of extra sauce. We always prefer flour tortillas for enchiladas. For us, its not an enchilada if it isnt a flour tortilla. So creamy and yummy!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Great recipe! The cream cheese is so different from any enchilada recipe I've made before but it was excellent in this dish! 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#1#0#I used refried beans on bottom of pan then added the enchiladas. This has o be the best recipe for enchiladas. YUMMY
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#1#1#Soo yummy. Made as directed with the exception of corn tortillas cause you know gluten. Totally a keeper
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#3#0#Made exactly as written. OMG! This was to die for! I'd give it more stars if I could. Everything was delicious, looked good and this was so easy to make. Makes a lot! Served with chopped lettuce, sour cream, tomatoes and jalapenos. Didn't really need the jalapenos because the salsa was a hot salsa. It's not often that I will find a recipe that is good for me to keep. This one is a keeper. 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Made this last night and my family loved it! Fairly easy to make. I reserved the chicken broth and the remaining cooked chicken for another meal. This recipe is company worthy! Very good! Use the flour tortillas.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#3#18#Enchiladas are made with corn tortillas...
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#7#3#So let me start off by saying that the enchilada filling itself is 5 stars, very very good. Definitly different than what my mom made growing up (chicana) but SOOO GOOD. I rated 4 because using flour tortillas just isn't a good idea if you want nice crispy enchiladas, I would consider using flour tortillas more of a wet burrito type dish. They get soggy. I used corn tortillas instead (and a bit of advice that makes a world of difference is lightly frying your corn tortillas in oil on each side before placing filling in and rolling, makes them more durable and much more crispy to hold up against the sauce) and for the sauce (if you like it a bit spicy, even if not they have regular sauce) I recommend El Pato you can usally find in the mexican section of any store. I use the yellow or green cans both delcious. Also, I chopped up white onion and put on top of the enchiladas before spreading cheese. I also baked uncovered for an extra 5-10 mins to get the edges extra crispy ( mi familia loves it this way!) . Served with a simple red rice my mom used to make and it was delicious! Also, I did use cubed chicken because I used some left over breasts from the night prior but I will definitly be shredding it next time, my family didn't really dig that. All in all I love the filling recipe, very very good. Will be keeping this one! Thank you :) 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#1#0#I never review recipes but I had to on this one because it was so good. I made it exactly as described with one small addition. I made a microwave pouch of Mexican rice and before I put the stuffing in each tortilla I put a little bit of the rice. We topped them with pico de gallo and sour cream. I usually dread eating leftovers but I have looked forward to these and this recipe makes a lot. I actually ended up filling a 9x13 dish plus another 8x8 dish. Thanks for the great recipe!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#1#0#These were the best I've ever made, thank you, thank you..... 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#2#0#This is an easy recipe to follow. I substituted black beans for pinto beans, I used a can of rotel tomatoes instead of the salsa, I also added sauteed onions as well. I've used flour tortillas in the past and they were gummy. Taste much better using corn tortillas. 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#2#0#I made this recipe and the filling and sauce were delicious. However the flour tortillas did get soggy and gummy. Next time definitely use corn tortillas.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#1#Very Good! I used corn tortillas. Used fresh chopped jalepeno peppers instead of canned. Added some chopped onion to the top of the chicken mix before rolling the tortilla. Served it with fresh salsa made from chopped tomatoes, jalepeno, onions, cilantro, salt and garlic powder. I like the idea of the 10 burritos; but have not done it yet. 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#1#0#Incredible!! Very easy to make and taste amazing. We be making this recipe again real soon.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#1#Delicious. This dish is requested by my family regularly. I decrease the chopped green chilies for less heat.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#1#1#Very Good. The only change I made was adding sauteed jalapeno to the salsa mixture just because we like it spicy and I had them in the garden. I will definitely make it again.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#1#11#If you have ever traveled to Mexico, you will not find a flour tortilla. Thus, Enchiladas are made with CORN tortillas not flour, that is why some reviewers say they get soggy.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#3#10#Enchiladas are made with corn tortillas, not flour tortillas. This is a burrito.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#This is a simple easy to make after working all day and was ready in no time! Very delicious - thanks!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#1#This was a simple delicious dish -- makes a lot --I have enough for second meal- I sauted onion and I used black beans & a lot more cheese. I added cheese inside before I folded and added more on top with sliced green onion and cilantro-- I served with corn and salad - nice meal -- will make again !
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Love easy recipes for Good Food
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Delicious, I made it with some turkey meat that I simmered off the bones. It was very easy.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#1#2#My husband and I are relatively new to Mexican cooking having traveled to NM to visit our daughter awhile back and absolutely loving the food while there. Since returning three years ago this dish is easily the best we've found -- and made -- yet! Thanks so much for the recipe, Kristi. My only addition to this was pickled red onions and Lime Crema Sauce (8 oz. sour cream, juice of 1/2 lime and 1/2 tsp. kosher salt) as garnishes. We've both decided it's a keeper and definitely worth making again and again -- even for company. P.S. We found that we could only use 1/4 cup filling per tortilla thus easily make almost twice as many enchiladas as stated. Each one was still very filling though. Thanks again! 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#3#1#I have made this twice, the first time exactly as written, the second time with a few changes. Although I liked the flavor, in the first batch the filling was too'soupy' for my taste. Also, the flour tortillas became soggy. In the second batch I eliminated the salsa, and used just enough hot sauce to flavor and moisten. I also used corn tortillas, which is what I am used to with enchiladas. I used about half of the can of chilies.I always put a small amount of cream cheese in my enchiladas, - it adds a nice richness, and many people don't even realize it is there, although they are aware of the richer flavor. A small amount of cream cheese also enhances sandwiches, even if they have another type of cheese already! 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#1#So delicious as instructed - flour tortillas did not get gummy or soggy like some people feared. In fact restaurants prepare them similarly. Easy to make for such flavor.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Excellent!! My daughter said Mom these are the best enchiladas you have ever made ! Thank you for the recipe! Definitely a keeper. 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Great tasting dish! I doubled the recipe and brought two pans of these enchiladas to a block party last month and everyone enjoyed it. The only change I made was I used a half cup of my garden jalapenos, chopped, instead of the canned chilies. This recipe is a keeper!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#These enchiladas were true comfort food. I made them without any changes to the recipe and they were easy, delicious, and appreciated by all who ate them. Thank you, Kristi, for an excellent recipe.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Hmmm, thought I had reviewed this b4. Going to make it again, probably using corn tortilla as b4, frying them slightly, making my own enchilada sauce, and not sure about which beans I'll use but tried black beans last time and liked. Both dh & I enjoyed this a lot. 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#1#1#Made this yesterday found the corn tortilla hard to work with even with heating on a skillet any suggestions or should i actually fry them ended up switching to the flour tortilla to finish the pan which were larger but earlier to work with although the reviews said the corn tortilla were better go fiqure.....
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Made this yesterday evening for dinner and it was a hit. Followed recipe with the substitution of black beans for pintos as we just do not like pinto beans. Very tasty and incredibly easy.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#THIS WAS A GREAT CHICKEN RECIPE....THANK YOU...SONNY
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#These sound really good! Has anyone tried these enchiladas with corn tortillas? I have a very severe gluten allergy and I can't have flour tortillas. 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Very nice flavor. I added some cooked rice to make it go further. Family loved it.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#2#1#Flour tortillas are going to become gummy tortillas when combined with liquid ingredients. Use corn tortilla for the best results.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#1#0#these were really good i used refried beans instead of pinto beans
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#These were really good. Kids ate them without complaining so that's a win! 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#what if you do not have pinto beans but refried beans can they sub for the pinto beans?
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Yum! Glad I made a double batch right away so I have one for the freezer!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Good recipe. We'll definitely have this again! 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#This is a very tasty recipe. I used mostly low fat ingredients and low carb tortillas. The taste was very, very good * A real Keeper in my books. One that I would highly endorse.JanieTaste Of Home Volunteer Field Editor
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Wonderful flavors and easy to make! This dish will become one of our weeknight staples!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#We have made this many times and it is delish! It is actually tastier than many enchiladas I've had in restaurants. I always make a double-batch because my busy family demands leftovers of this great meal to have handy! 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#I doubled the recipe for my family of 5 and didn't have any left they enjoyed it so much! Very easy to make as well. 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#This recipe comes together quickly with leftover chicken. The salsa and cream cheese makes an interesting base. You can kick it up with pepper jack cheese and fresh peppers. I really enjoyed chopped fresh tomatoes and green onions on top.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Great!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Didn't care for the flour tortillas. Corn tortillas would have been better, I think. Filling was just okay. 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#This was really good! I divided it up between two 8x8 pans so I could freeze one and I used turkey instead of chicken and a little extra enchilada sauce because I had some. I love that this used ingredients that I had on hand so I didn't have to buy a whole bunch of extra stuff. 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#This is home idea flavor, not restaurant. But very tasty anyway.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Very tasty, filling and makes you want more!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#So delicious and easy. Will definitely make this a regular!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#This is very tasty and truly simple. Used leftover roasted chicken, tomatillo salsa and about double the amt of enchilada sauce. This is a keeper.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#The whole family loved this recipe!!!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#My family did not particularly care for the consistency of these enchiladas. We found the chicken mixture rather soupy and actually used a slotted spoon to dip the mixture onto the tortillas. The flavors are good, but we will most likely not make this recipe again.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#So delicious!!! I also used a cheater chicken that I shredded and it turned out amazing!! This recipe is a keeper.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#VERY easy to make; great taste! I used shredded rotisserie chicken and I spread refried beans on the burrito style shells rather than using pinto beans. I think that chopped onion would be good in the chicken mixture as well.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#This was easy to make and my family loved it, even the picky 6 year old!! I substituted black beans for pinto and Queso Fresco for cream cheese (had on hand). It was just delicious. A definite repeater and company worthy!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Easy to make ahead of time and pop them into the oven when needed. Also, easily modifiable to your personal likes/dislikes.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#These enchiladas are so easy to make and are absolutely delicious! My husband LOVES these and I've now had to make them 3 weeks in a row! I follow the recipe, except that I use pulled chicken from a Rotisserie chicken, and I use 10 inch tortillas rather than 6 inch. My 3 year old even likes these! I serve with spanish rice, and a side salad of lettuce, tomato, avacado and sour cream. Yum! 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#This recipe was absolutely amazing! My husband is a huge mexican food fan and he was ranting and raving about it all night.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Just tried it tonight and loved it! Like one reviewer said, depending on the salsa you might not even need to add the green chili, unless you like it hot. I think next time I will half the cream cheese because that made it a little too rich for us. This would make an easy and popular potluck dish.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Very good enchilada recipe, I was looking for something better than past recipes & this will the one I use from now on.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#These were really good, simple and fast. I served them with my new favorite rice; Viggo Mexican Rice.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Yummy recipe we all love! I blend the salsa (no onion chunks for my kids) and sometimes omit the green chilis for a less spicy enchilada but it's all around one of my favorites. 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Delicious and makes plenty. Yes, I agree. It makes GREAT leftovers! My husband has asked for me to make again!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#I didn't add the pinto beans or chilis for personal taste and they turned out great. This is not one of my regular recipes! 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#This was very good! I used black beans instead of pinto and the johnny cake made it all a great combo!!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#1#This recipe was so easy to make using the $6 rotisserie chicken from Costco and some impromptu home made salsa made from stewed tomatoes, onions, lemon juice and 2 canned chipotle adobo chiles for spice/flavor. Made a full 9 x 12 tray which took longer to warm 45 minutes at 350 degrees. Tastes even better the second day! A WINNER.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Super easy, fast and delicious!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Love these!!!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#This recipe was super easy and a huge hit with my husband!! He didn't even know I substituted lower fat cream cheese! I love these and will definitely make them again!! 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#I forgot to add my children LOVED this I havent seen them eat so much at on sitting. they eat more than me.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#This reciepe was okay I had to add lots of different ingedience to make it have good flavor. It was easy and a good base to make my own.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#These are yummy! I agree w/ teadrinkinlady and will use more enchilada sauce next time. Definately going to make for friends and family if I am able to share ;0)
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#Awesome recipe!! Relatively nutritious and all my kids loved it - even my picky eaters. This has become a regular at our house.
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#super easy and really good...i use 1/3 fat cream cheese, black beans, fresh chopped jalepeno peppers, whole wheat tortillas and pepper jack cheese (everything else i left the same). I serve with light sour cream and some jasmine rice and my hubby and i love it
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#I have passed this on to many family members
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#With very picky eaters in the family, I am often searching for something to please everyone. I thought this recipe was a long shot, but everyone loved it. Now I get requests for it all the time. I actually cook the chicken on my Foreman grill and then shred it with a couple forks and it really soaks up the flavor. Thanks for the great recipe!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#I had left over chicken so this seemed a good way to use it. we loved this recipe. I would make it for company. It is very pretty when it comes out of the oven.Shawn from Manchester,Mi
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#I tried this recipe the other night since I had all the ingredients on hand. My family just raved about the flavor and it looked pretty too..My husband said it was absolutely delicious. It was easy to prepare and will definitely make it again. Thanks Taste of Home!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#I have taken this recipe to a few gatherings and have had rave reviews. Everyone wants the recipe and can't believe how easy it is. I used black beans because we like those better, but otherwise it is Excellent!!! 
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#My family loved these! Easy to make too.CA
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#This is a yummie recipe and very easy to make. I think the only change I would make is to use a bit more enchilada sauce. Black beans are good in this too!
Easy Chicken Enchiladas#0#0#This is by far and away my favorite chicken enchilada recipe. It's also one of the least fattening that I've seen. My husband is always begging me to make this recipe. Since there is only two of us in the home, we eat on this for several days. You can't go wrong with this recipe! It's great! 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#A hit with my family. Easy to make. Moist with a great banana flavor. Cream cheese frosting compliments it so well.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#4#1#I made this recipe for church snacks today, and it was a hit. Very easy, and a nice change from banana bread for those bananas that are getting ripe. The combination of bananas and sour cream make for a very moist cake. I agree with the other reviews, with the cream cheese frosting being the perfect topping. I will make this recipe again.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I love this recipe as a switch up for using ripe bananas. The combination of the butter, sour cream and banana make for a very moist dessert. Cream cheese frosting is the perfect topping. A keeper!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#4#1#These were really good! I love the combination of bananas and cream cheese, so I knew that I would like these and yes - I certainly did! I prefer a bit more texture, so I added some chopped walnuts to the bars and they turned out great that way.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#2#2#Just made these banana bars for Easter. They were delicious, I added a half banana to the icing. I wasn't sure if the banana would turn the icing a weird color or texture but it turned out great. Next time I will add an entire banana. My icing was a little sticky (meaning it came off a little on the cellophane when transporting it), I'm guessing I could have added more confectioners sugar, but it just seemed like a ton of sugar. Regardless, it was great! Next time I will also add the 2 T. of whipping cream as mentioned below. Thanks for the recipe! 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#2#4#Yes, this is an EXCELLENT recipe, and I've already added it to my computer recipe book. It is quick, easy and delicious. I made my cake, froze it, and when I was ready to use it, I thawed and then iced it. I shared it my my sewing group and they all loved it. A few pieces of walnuts sprinkled on each piece was a great addition for those who like nuts. kbbradford's review (below this one) has a great hint....add the 2 T. whipping cream to the frosting, because it does make a wonderfully smooth and creamy frosting and it is oh so easy to spread. 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#9#5#This is an excellent recipe that I will forever have on hand. Made this a second time an added fresh cooked apples, nuts and minced dried apricots. Also used a cream cheese icing tip that I ALWAYS use (added 2 T. Whipping cream) after cream cheese is beaten Tillis smooth. This makes the softest, spreadable frosting ever. I shared slices with friends and everyone raves on the moist and tasty cake.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#2#0#I made these for a party and everyone asked for the recipe. I actually made them ahead of time, froze them and frosted them the day of the party. Very moist, the flavor and texture were excellent and they're not too sweet.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#6#0#Very good. I make it in a 9x13 and serve as a cake. It's become a family favorite for birthdays!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#2#So good. I know I'm leaving this rating awfully late, but I made this up as a dessert for Christmas. And there was none left at the end of the day. So good! 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Easy and delicious! Did not get 4 dozen from this recipe - maybe my family likes big servings!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#1#I made this as written-came out perfectly! I made the bars for a church gathering, and they were a big hit. It definitely made enough to feed a crowd. The cake is moist and delicious, and the frosting scrumptious! I kept them well chilled and they were a yummy treat. VFE
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#0#Makes great banana muffins as well.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Delicious!!!!!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#3#0#This was super easy to make and the results were a delicious and moist cake! I substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream because it was what I had on hand. I also frosted it with a maple brown butter frosting. Delicious!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#3#0#This recipe is wonderful. Very moist, huge banana taste and the best cream cheese icing I've ever made. A keeper for sure. As mentioned they freeze well and take no time to thaw when you're ready for dessert. I put the bars in the refrigerator after I ice them so they are easier to cut with icing on them.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Our favorite banana bar recipe! I make it anytime I need to bring dessert to an event.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#0#This is a great recipe and everyone really enjoyed them. I did have to bake the bars an additional 15 minutes. The only change I made was reducing the vanilla extract,in the frosting, by 1/2 tsp and adding 1/2 tsp. of banana extract.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I have made this recipe several times and always get rave reviews from my friends. They are always delicious!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#4#0#These bars are so moist! I used 2 cups of powdered and a tad of milk to give it the right consistency. It needs very little icing because the bars are so good. I had leftover icing.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#3#12#Delicious dessert that my family adored more than other cakes I have made, but I did make a few changes, and it's hard to say the impact they had. I used 1 cup almond flour, 1 cup regular instead of just regular flour. I used 2 sticks of butter, 4 eggs, 5 extremely ripe bananas, a splash of whole milk and oat milk instead of sour cream. I added cinammon and pecan crumbles to the cake, and I used brown sugar. I put the cake in a Bundt pan. The icing was perfect with on 2 cups confectioners sugar, and extra vanilla. This cake was so moist and impressive! So I guess you could say that this recipe provided the foundation for where I went with it, but what I got was fabulous! 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I used butter cream icing because my kids don't like cream cheese icing. So sweet. Is there another kind of icing I can use? Cake was delicious! 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These are delicious and easy to make!!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Delicious and easy to make! I tried to reduce the amount of sugar just a little and it came out great. I will definitely make this again.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#1#Excellent! I always cut the sugar in half and add a smidgen of stevia leaf powder in order to trim calories and fat from recipes; especially from sugar filled desserts. My bananas were small so I used 3 and mashing them gave me a bit more than a cup. I also use a non-egg egg replacer because of allergies to eggs. Some recipes don't turn out as well using egg replacer but this one turned out beautifully! I also use an icing sugar made with tapioca flour; due to allergies. I used half the icing sugar and added about 1/2 cup tapioca flour to help with the volume and DID NOT add in any stevia. There was still enough frosting to cover the bars and it was still plenty sweet. Some reviews mentioned that the recipe didn't make 4 dozen but it does! I cut into 6 rows (10 inch side) by 8 rows (15 inch side). They were the perfect size! I took them to a large gathering and received many compliments on them. DEFINITELY A KEEPER! 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made this to bring to my monthly book group meeting and it was delicious! My daughter and mom tried it before I brought it and raved. (I cut into bars on a plate before bringing it). Everyone enjoyed it.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#do you freeze them with or without the frosting?
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#0#Very good! I sprinkle toasted chopped walnuts on top and add 1 C to the batter. Nice addition..
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Cake part is perfect as is. For the frosting, I only use 1/2 the ingredients, adding icing sugar and a little milk to get the right consistency. Freezes well, too!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#My go-to for any occasion. Wonderful as written and they are cake like . DONT change a thing. Perfect as written
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#2#0#Simply scrumptious!! I wanted to make these for church this morning so was worried about time but they went together quickly and I love that they also bake and cool quickly. I used 4 frozen medium bananas and it was just barely over 1 cup. Used the liquid too that comes with freezing bananas. I used a half sheet pan, I think 15-1/2 x 11-1/4, and it was the perfect size for bar thickness. Baked mine for 23 minutes, rotating pan with 8 minutes left. One rack lower than middle of oven. Nice medium brown on top. Put in the cold garage to cool quickly. I had about 1-1/2 cups of leftover cream cheese frosting I'd used for cookies. Very thick so added maybe a good half a cup of soured milk till the right consistency for a glaze. Spread over the mostly cooled bars, cut into 40 bars which yielded 2 inch sized bars. They were gobbled up at church and we still had some to bring home. My family loved them! These will be my go to banana recipe. I loathe making banana bread so these are banana goodies I will make often. 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#2#0#Little confused on why it says that it makes 4 dozen. Should I only pour half the batter in, and then make again? Found this to be more cake-like than bar-like. I also put it in for 35 minutes because the middle was too pudding-like, though I was nervous about the browning edges (I live at high-altitude if that's relevant). Overall, an easy winner to take to work or a family gathering. I put salted caramel in the cream cheese frosting which was amazing. I will try enhancing it even more with another banana or some almonds next time. 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These are to die for! I took them to an event and barely came home with any left. Everyone raved about how wonderful they were and went back for seconds. I only used 1 cup of sugar in the batter and 3 cups of powdered sugar in the frosting--they were plenty sweet with all flavors standing out. This is going in the permanent recipe box!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These bars were amazing. I also made mine in a 9 x13 dish. Will try in sheet next time. Was more like a cake. Very dense and moist. Frosting put it over the top. Will make again. 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Delicioso!! Awesome recipe.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This is delicious. I made the cake portion in a 9 x13 and added 18 minutes to the bake time. I didn't make the icing because the cake was so delicious. It's like the BEST banana nut bread ever
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#1#Fantastic, easy and delicious! No more banana bread, these bars are now my go to!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These are wonderful! Made exactly as written. The bars are easy to make and the sour cream makes them moist and delicious. And the cream cheese frosting sends them over the top. Great way to use up ripe bananas. This recipe is perfect for potlucks, or anytime you'e craving something sweet! Will definitely make these again!Volunteer Field Editor 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made these Frosted Banana Bars for the umpteenth time recently and it's ALWAYS a winner. Easy to make with ingredients on hand, quantity fit for a king, and flavor to beat the band. This TOH Volunteer Field Editor is ecstatic with this recipe and the outcome. This is a no fail, from scratch recipe. I'll be making this for as long as bananas roam the earth. You will love it, too. It's also great to freeze baked or even just the batter. I double my recipes often and save some for another time when I need something in a pinch.Bake this and be the star of your show. I think a chocolate icing would be marvelous on top, too, wouldn't you? My international friends who don't like sweet things would likely prefer a dusting of powdered sugar.Thanks, Michelle. 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#0#These are wonderful. They are even better topped with fresh sliced strawberries!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made these for a family gathering & everyone loved them. They had the perfect amount of banana flavor & the frosting was so good I could eat it by itself!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I followed the recipe as written, but I did add some walnuts in the batter and sprinkled some on top of the frosting. The cake was moist and so delicious! I baked it in a 13X9 stone pan for about 35 minutes. This is going to be my go to recipe when I make banana bars. 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#A delicious way to use overripe bananas. The sour cream makes the bars extremely moist.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made this exactly as written except I didn't have sour cream so I used the Dannon light and fit vanilla Greek yogurt, and I added semi sweet chocolate chips. I put it in a 13x9 pan and baked it for 35 minutes. It is moist and light. My husband gave it a 4.5 and my 5 year old gave it a solid 10. My 20 year old has not been here to try it. I am keeping this recipe for taking places. It is fantastic. 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Made these in a 13 x 9 glass dish, baked for 28 minutes & my friends & family just raved about them! Will definitely make the same way again.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Absolutely the best recipe for banana bars I have ever baked and eaten. My husband can't keep out of them, and I took them to a sick friends house and her husband and son were hiding them from each other! Didn't and wouldn't change a thing except I did add walnuts to the batter as we love nuts with anything banana. 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Best recipe that I've found for banana bars. 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These were a giant hit at my house. My 3 daughters each have boyfriends and they all loved them. The sour cream made them so moist. I may use 3 bananas next time and I know I'd love some nuts in them. I did find that as delicious as they were right after frosting them, they were even better the next day! I think the flavors got more intense as it sat overnight. Only lasted till the second day! 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#1#i really liked this recipes cause it only has... 96 mg of sodium and when u go to make this - use unsalted butter! I added some applesauce and some roasted pecans and every1... Loved it!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Fabulous! Moist and tender. My daughter who doesn't care for banana loved these. I was shy some banana and used applesauce. Will make again. This replaces beloved favorite banana cake recipe. 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Big hit at work. Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe. I added chopped walnuts to the top of the frosting. I also cut back on the confectionary sugar to 2 1/2 cups. I used 3 bananas.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#0#This is a good recipe. I tried it using a muffin-top pan (350? for 20 minutes). It was easy to make, also.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I just added raisins and nuts. Delish
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Reminds me of when I was a kid!??
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#0#These were absolutely delicious. I didn't make the homemade frosting (used a canned cream cheese frosting) but the bars were perfect! My whole family loved them and my son in law said these are the best things I've ever eaten !!! Raves all around 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This recipe is so simple and so delicious! These are my go to when someone wants something banana. I don't hardly ever make banana bread anymore! 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#My family raves about this recipe.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I've been making this recipe since I first read it in TOH quite a few years ago. It is absolutely delicious! It has become a family favorite that I have shared at many occasions and has been a big hit. Great way to use ripe bananas. I prefer baking it in a stoneware bar pan. 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#1#I have made these bars many times and it is my go to recipe for banana bars. Not only are they my sons favorite, whenever I make them to serve at church people tell me how much they enjoyed the wonderful banana taste and how moist they are.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#1#just got and made your banana bars. I don't mind saying that I was NOT surprised at all. as all the rec. u have given me where so DAM good I just had to let u know how much I LOVE your rec. thanks again scotty. 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Easy and great tasting!!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These are amazing though I did make some slight modifications. I used 3 bananas (slight,y over one cup and I used a 9x13 pan and had it cook about 35 minutes (I checked after 25 and still runny in middle. Check it after 5 min, 2x). I also used about half the confectioners sugar it called for the frosting and it was perfect!!!!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Made these last night and they are really good. I used 3 bananas that were just over the 1 cup and I added extra vanilla - Sorry - They are wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Oh my goodness this is the best banana bread with the cream cheese frosting, I really never liked banana bread but it's on and craken, when my son and his in laws eat this my might switch from me making so many sweet potatoe pies. 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I have baked these bars for several years and there are never any left for the next day. My daughters and daughter-in-law and grandkids bring me very ripe bananas as a hint to make these. My only recommendation would be to make one half of the frosting as it really makes a lot. Would give these 10 stars if I could.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#So good!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I make there all the time. It's a great use up for bananas. My family loves them and they're a nice change from banana bread. Sometimes I add chopped walnuts to the batter or sprinkle on top of the frosting. 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Above it says that you can freeze them to pull out for later. I really like this idea :) but can you please help an unexperienced baker to ensure I do that correctly? I'm pretty good at messing things up lol. Do you frost them before you store them in the freezer? Do they need to cool before placing in the freezer? How do you store them in the freezer, in a pan, ziplock bag, etc.? How long can they be stored in the freezer? Thank you for your help :) 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#A co-worker brought this and used whipped vanilla frosting instead. It was not only a time saver but worked perfectly with the bars. I'm going to make them for the next family gathering!!! 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made them in a 13x9 pan instead and just baked it longer so it turned out more like a really moist cake. Delicious!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#great recipe! I have made them just as written, wonderfull, moist, delicate flavor...then the next time, I did not have sour cream so used vanilla yogurt and added toffee pieces- still good. I have made them as cupcakes and they rise very nicely and stay moist.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Yummy!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I had a houseful of company coming and bananas that were overripe and needed to be used. This recipe was perfect! It makes a big pan full, and the flavor was great. Since not everyone likes cream cheese frosting and I didn't want to have to worry about having to store these in the fridge, I decided to go with a cinnamon one instead. I got lots of compliments on them from my guests, and I still have plenty to take to work to share tomorrow! I'll definitely be making these again. 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#wow- I have a new go-to recipe for my ripe bananas- very moist light, and addictive- they make at least 48 bars.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Made these bars last nite, using bananas, that I had froze, but be sure to thaw them out good. Had them for a luncheon, today, very good and easy, will make again.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I followed this recipe exactly as is except I used 3 bananas and it is so delicious and moist. Easy to make and great for potlucks.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Great as is and also makes great cupcakes
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I have made this wonderful recipe since TofH published it in the magazine. I use Betty Crocker cream cheese frosting, though. If you get a few leftovers since it makes a big batch, try wrapping cut pieces in plastic wrap and putting them in the freezer to put in lunch bags. They are outstanding.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Absolutely the best banana bars ever!! These were a huge hit with my family!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#yummy and easy
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#YUMMMMMMM
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Delicious
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Girls at work loved it!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Made these yesterday and my family said this recipe is a keeper!I also made the cream cheese frosting but used my recipe: 1/2 stick butter,1-8oz cream cheese,2 cups powdered sugar,1 1/2 tsp.vanilla extract. Made my bars in a 9x13 pan and the frosting amount I made covers perfectly also garnished w/ crushed nuts.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#My husband never wants to be without these banana bars!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#do you freeze with the frosting ?
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I loved these bars but i dident even use icing on them. by the time they were cooled they smelled to good they had to be eatin. The kids loved them as is also!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These bars are AMAZING!!! So delicious and my entire family loves them!!!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This recipe is outstanding and I wouldn't change a thing. I would not dream of cutting the frosting to half or two thirds as suggested by some other reviewers. I bake all the time for my co-workers and they love these bars. It's perfect just the way it is. But then again, we love frosting. Thanks for the recipe!! 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Yum! Next time I may even reduce the sugar a bit more! I didn't even make the frosting though, and these were still very good! They're very moist! I brought these to my gymnastics meet and they were a big hit! 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Best bars ever. I make these twice a week. One for home and one for work. All my cowokers are always asking for them.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I've been making these for years, since I first saw them in the magazine & they are the best! A family or office favorite for sure! 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#YUM! Make these now! I used 3 bananas and they turned out great.~ Theresa
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These bars are SO good! I made some alterations and they still turned out great! (cut back on sugar, used 3/4 cup of vanilla yogurt & 1/4 cup sour cream, 3 bananas, added walnuts.) I also halved the frosting and STILL thought it was a little too much (but soooo tasty)
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#When I mix up a batch of these, I bake them using my muffin-top pans, then sandwich the tops together with the frosting. These freeze well! 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Favorite banana bar recipe ever! I use 3 bananas and cut the frosting recipe down to 2/3 batch. Delicious!!!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This is one of our family favorites! They sure don't last long! :)

Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#1#0#I thought these bars were very heavy . I don't think I will make again. 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I found this this morning and made them. They are tasty,moist and big on taste. I did have to bake a few min. longer but they are delish.....
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This recipe was delightful! The flavors are big and delicious. I had family over for supper and they couldn't get enough dessert. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again... 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Thanks to the many potlucks I've taken these to, there are lots of people sharing this recipe with others and getting rave reviews. I've made them at my grandson's request, into cupcakes, used the same frosting, for his classmates and the teacher made copies of the recipe while I was still passing out the cupcakes. Big, BIG hit at my house!! 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#A+ recipe; this is hands down my two adult nieces favorite! Highly recommend...
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Love these cake bars! Have been making this recipe for years. I usually half the frosting recipe.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Fabulous and easy recipe. I cut them for lunches putting iced sides together before placing in wrappers. Definitely a favorite to find in the lunch bag!

Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This is a hit with my family everytime I make it!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Took these to work--received many compliments and requests for the recipe. Definitely a keeper and so easy and quick!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Made them for fellowship after church. The were a hit! It's nice to have such a delicious use for just two ripe bananas...my banana bread recipe requires three. 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I made these bars for the first time for the past weekend get-away with family. Were a big hit!! I also think I would cut the frosting recipe in half (I only used 3/4 of it), or maybe add less powdered sugar so not so sweet. I will definately make these again. Nice change from the usual banana bread!! Would also be deliscious with the tiny chocolate chips, or adding peanut butter to the frosting also.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These are outrageous!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I baked these bars for less than the recommended 20 minutes, as they were already pulling away from the sides of the pan. Otherwise, everything went off easily and without a hitch. Delish!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Will make again: nice and moist. Only used half of the ingredient for the frosting (and it was still quite sweet)
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These banana bars are simply the best!!! Whenever I make them, my family devours them. When I take them to a party or dinner, I am always asked for the recipe. Yum-o!!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#1#These bars are so good! They are very moist and flavorful. I brought them to work and my co-workers commented on how good they were. I did cut the frosting recipe in half, and it turned out to be just enough. I will surely make them again.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Been making these for awhile now. Never disappointing.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I rarely rate recipes -- but this one was SO delicious I needed to! I followed the directions - and got rave reviews from my co-workers! I need to make another batch for Christmas!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I have made this recipe for years and every time I serve them for company several will request the recipe! Easy and delicious!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These have been a family favorite since the recipe came out in the cookbook. Took it to potlucks when we were raching and it was a big hit. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#I have been making these bars since the recipe first was posted. They are a hit with my family, co-workers, and friends. THis is always the first choice n my home now with over rip bananas. Thanks for the great share.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#We loved these bars! I saw the suggestion adding walnuts -- can't wait to try that. YUMMY! 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These are very good banana bars. I think next time, I will cut the frosting in half, too much frosting for me. The bars were already good, so much frosting seemed to overpower them.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Ditto to the above comments. An added bonus is that it is so easy to make, great for a crowd, and turns out perfect everytime.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This is the best banana bar recipe. It is a favorite in my home. I've made these for potlucks and they are a huge hit!Jill 
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#Ever since I discovered this recipe in the magazine it has become a standard in our house.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#This is excellent.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These bars are very tasty. The only change I made to the recipe was to add 1 cup of chopped walnuts to the batter. The bars are still deliciously moist after 5 days. They also taste great without the frosting, just sprinkled lightly with powered sugar.
Banana Bars with Cream Cheese Frosting#0#0#These were great! They have a strong banana flavour, which we love. I used 3 mashed bananas and halved the frosting recipe, as suggested by another reviewer. The frosting was still very sweet. I will make this again and sometimes without the frosting. 
Blueberry French Toast#5#0#Five star recipe! I used Sara Lee Artesano Brioche bread. I only used one bar of cream cheese and increased the blueberries to 1 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup. I did have to bake a little longer than 1 hour. So delicious!!! I will definitely make again.
Blueberry French Toast#3#0#A stunning dish! Definitely NOT too eggy as someone stated. This is a staple in my book of recipes. Make it as directed and it is wonderful! One time I did add some sprinkled cinnamon and that was great too. 
Blueberry French Toast#2#0#absolutely wonderful!
Blueberry French Toast#1#0#One of our al time favorites! Famile and friends love this!
Blueberry French Toast#3#0#I have been making this for years! 20+. Every time I do it's a huge hit! People aren't sure if they are eating a main dish or a dessert. So yes most definitely a hit. It's also great with a mixture of fruits. Mixed berries or even peaches. Yes you can by pass the overnight step as well, leaving it overnight makes the eggs custard up more.

Blueberry French Toast#1#0#Made for dinner tonight. My family loved it! Voted by my kids as a recipe to add to my personal recipe collection. Very easy to make. We skipped the overnight step and mixed this recipe up and cooked it immediately. Turned out so amazing! Looking forward to making again!
Blueberry French Toast#3#1#I have made this several times and it was very yummy. Here's a nice thing to know... When it's warm it's breakfast and when you partake of the yumminess cold because you didn't want to take the time to hear it up, it becomes dessert (think blueberry cheesecake) this is one of the many things I am thankful for my husband for (his impatient I'll just eat it cold. has discovered different things along this line.) 
Blueberry French Toast#3#0#Lovely! I used day old sour dough - I can recommend it!
Blueberry French Toast#1#0#Very delicious. Definitely use real maple syrup, it does make a difference. I also use brioche bread for a richer flavor.
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#This has been our families favorite breakfast dish for over 10 years! Make for almost every holiday usually the day beforehand so I have more time to spend with my family!
Blueberry French Toast#1#1#I have been making this recipe for years and it is delicious. If you don't have real maple syrup on hand you can use any maple flavored syrup. A great company brunch recipe. 
Blueberry French Toast#1#0#Excellent! Made this for Christmas morning breakfast. It was yummy!
Blueberry French Toast#3#0#Fabulous! Why go out for breakfast when you can make this at home?! Since I am cooking for 2, I cut the bread portion of the recipe in half, but made the full portion of the blueberry sauce. Perfection! I used an 11 x 7 pan and it still needed to be baked for the same amount of time as the full recipe. 
Blueberry French Toast#3#0#I have been making this as written for holiday brunches ever since it appeared in Taste of Home 20 years ago. It has never failed to be the first emptied pan on the table. Now that my children are adults with families, I have been asked to make two pans! Absolutely Wonderful!!
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#Delicious!!!!
Blueberry French Toast#3#1#This delicious recipe has been a family favorite and my main go to brunch recipe ever since it first appeared in TOH in 1996! I only use one package of cream cheese instead of two, since we prefer it that way. As a Volunteer Field Editor for TOH magazine, I highly recommend it! 
Blueberry French Toast#2#1#Made this for Christmas morning. We really liked it.Made it a few times since, The last time I added chunked up breakfast sausage links to it. Yum
Blueberry French Toast#1#0#In a word...yum. Another word...easy.
Blueberry French Toast#1#0#Delicious beyond words!
Blueberry French Toast#2#0#My family loves this recipe, just as it is written -- with authentic maple syrup. It makes a great meal gift as well. The homemade syrup is really delicious on it.
Blueberry French Toast#2#0#Very tasty. I used half the cream cheese and would use even less. But that's just us. Maple syrup works fine instead of the sauce. Or just use a jar of whatever flavor jelly you made that didn't set. Instant syrup. 
Blueberry French Toast#1#0#I made this for Christmas breakfast and it is the best breakfast casserole I have ever had. Everyone loved it. It is rich, but delicious, and could be made with strawberries or other fruits of similar consistency.
Blueberry French Toast#2#0#This is one of my Go To recipes for company breakfast. The scratch blueberry syrup is very tasty over the creamy egg bake. I use 8 oz of cream cheese, not 16 oz. as the recipe calls for, and it is plenty. Love this recipe! 
Blueberry French Toast#1#4#I was not a fan, to bland and eggy for my taste. I halved the recipe since there are only two of us and I'm so glad I did. The sauce was good but the rest of it was just blah. I will not be making this one again 
Blueberry French Toast#2#0#I made this for Christmas brunch along with a savory casserole and it was a huge hit! I can't stop thinking about how delicious this french toast was - will make it for New Year's Day as well! 
Blueberry French Toast#1#1#delicious! everyone liked
Blueberry French Toast#2#0#I love the recipe as is. It does need to bake a bit longer than in the recipe but of is not eggy at all. I really hate egg. This recipe is really good but rich. 
Blueberry French Toast#1#0#I halved the recipe and it was more than enough for 2 people. I also chose to beat the cream cheese with the liquid before adding as opposed to doing the cubes, and I added both a little sugar and pure real vanilla. However I agree with some other remarks that it was too eggy. I could taste the egg more than the other ingredients and the texture was very dense. Instead of 6 eggs (again I halved) next time I would do 4 but keep everything else the same. Sauce is good but very sweet, a little goes a long way. I will definitely make it again, just change the eggs to help the texture be more like french toast than an egg casserole. I'd give it higher stars if it wasn't for the eggs. 
Blueberry French Toast#2#0#I've been making this recipe for years now. Any time I've served it for brunch, it's gone before it even has time to cool. I follow the recipe as is, and it's pure perfection! 
Blueberry French Toast#1#0#I made this recipe twice and the 2nd time around, I purposely made additional adjustments to it. I used 1 loaf of Pepperidge Farm Brown Sugar Cinnamon Bread and I purposely just used the whole loaf, crusts and all the 2nd time around! I used just 1 package of cream cheese and the 2nd time around, I beat the 8-oz. package of cream cheese with 2/3 cup sugar 5 minutes, then I added 6 eggs and 1-1/2 tsp. almond extract. I scraped the bottom and sides of bowl and then I added 2 cups of milk. I used 1 PINT of blueberries for both the casserole and for the blueberry sauce. For the sauce, I'd added 2 Tbsp. bottled lemon juice and I stirred the sugar and cornstarch together before adding the water, then cooked the 3 minutes until it came to a boil. I stirred in the blueberries, lowered the heat and cooked 10 minutes or untilthe berries burst. After removing from the heat, I stirred in 1 Tbsp. butter. I think that creaming the sugar with the cream cheese makes this dish more flavorful than just cubing it! I'd spritzed the 13x9x2 baking pan with PAM, used a paper towel to spread the spray around and I'd placed the bread cubes in the prepared pan. Then I added the berries and poured the milk/egg mixture over the bread cubes and berries. I did allow the French toast to sit, covered, 8 hours on the 2nd time around and then cut vents in the foil to allow the steam to escape! I also did allow the dish to sit, covered, 1/2 hour before baking, then I baked, covered, 30 minutes at 350o F. and then uncovered the dish and baked 30 minutes more. For an added touch, I sprinkled 4 tsp. cinnamon-sugar over top on the 2nd time around! I think that my 2nd time worked much better-the first time, I felt that I could improve this recipe! Using sugar is better for me than using honey or maple syrup!My first time around, I'd used about 9 Tbsp. maple syrup all together and I'd used 2 cups of milk! I still stuck to 6 eggs, though and the 1-1/2 tsp. almond extract. The first time around I HAD cubed the 8-oz. package of cream cheese and topped with the remaining bread cubes and blueberries!The sauce is GREAT! I'm finding that what may work for the original recipe with 1 person-for me, it helped to make these additional improvements to have a dish proudly served!delowenstein 
Blueberry French Toast#0#5#Here's another one that I followed the directions right down to the letter. First of all it was to'Eggy for me. So I'd strongly suggest that you NOT use a dozen of eggs that this calls for! That's just WAY to much egg. The ladys at Church liked it but I can't believe this is a Grand prize winner. I won't be making this again. I was so disappointed! One lady at Church had to actually spit it out of her mouth. She said sorry but there's way to many textures going on with this. I did really like the homemade blueberry syrup however. I would rank the Syrup Only a 5 but not the casserole. I find it surprising that So many of ya'll like this so well. 
Blueberry French Toast#1#0#This is the casserole version of a great french toast recipe I have made. This has been a family and extended family favorite from the first time I tried it this way. My sister's family has a weekend pig roast every year and I make Sunday brunch. This is always on the menu and I always get requests for the recipe. 
Blueberry French Toast#1#0#I have been making this recipe for years and it always receives rave reviews. When we are having breakfast buffets at my office, I am always asked to bring it. I use reduced fat cream cheese and I double the recipe for the sauce because we usually run out. We debate whether it is breakfast food or dessert.

Blueberry French Toast#0#0#This is an awesome breakfast casserole. We enjoy it in the summer using fresh picked blueberries. I freeze blueberries and when the holidays come, I have a wonderful morning treat for my family. Taste of Home Field Editor
Blueberry French Toast#2#0#This recipe was absolutely wonderful. I plan on serving it on Christmas morning along with an overnight egg souffle dish. I love to have a few delicious recipes like this to use for overnight guests or during the holidays. This one is a winner!
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#I make this every Christmas Day for brunch. It is also my go to recipe for brunch anytime. Every time I serve it, someone asks for the recipe! 
Blueberry French Toast#0#1#I will make again with revisions. Creaming cream cheese and a little sugar together and adding it instead of chunks. Also, as another reviewer stated, doubling the sauce but with only one cup of sugar. It was quick and easy to try but it was a tad bland for my family's taste buds. But we will do it again with the above changes. 
Blueberry French Toast#2#0#Very good bread pudding, but next time, I will blend the egg mixture with the cream cheese and only use 8 ounces. Good enough to try again and again...
Blueberry French Toast#1#0#This is a wonderful recipe! Have served it many times to overnight guests and everyone always enjoys it! The only thing I do differently is add more blueberries...YUM
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#This is my favorite breakfast casserole that I make. It is also a favorite of anyone that tries it. I have made some minor revisions. I use one one 8 ounce block of low fat cream cheese and a whole loaf of white bread minus 4 slices ( it makes it more substantial). I use 2+ cups of blueberries in the casserole ( one is not enough for an 9x13 pan) I also make a double batch of the syrup but only add 1 total cup of sugar. This allows a person to really add a nice scoop of syrup. If you add 2 cups of sugar it is much too sweet. I have the perfect breakfast treat !! Thanks taste of home for providing this fabulous recipe many years ago.
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#Excellent recipe! I made this for a women's breakfast meeting and every woman went back for second or third helpings, raving constantly. Almost a dozen asked for the recipe! So tasty and filling and satisfying! 
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#We enjoyed this recipe, but found it to be a little rich. Next time, I'm using only 8 ounces of cream cheese and I'm going to try freezing it first so it cuts easier. I'm also going to double the syrup, as it's delicious. Thank you for the recipe! 
Blueberry French Toast#1#0#Either something went terribly wrong (could be my fault) or it was not to anyone's liking... 
Blueberry French Toast#1#0#We served this on Christmas morning and it was a hit. Next time, I'm only going to use 1 bar of cream cheese (freezing it first so it will chunk easier), as it was a little too decadent with two. I'm also going to double the sauce, as it really added flavor to the meal.Thanks for a great recipe! 
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#This is really yummy!
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#Had family in town and made this the only thing I did diffident was I put the cream cheese in the food prosseser because we don't like it chunky in the recipe. Every one loved it. 
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#I used my houseguests as recipe raters on this and tried this out this morning. They thought it was very good. I had to bake it 10+ minutes longer than the recipe called for and that eliminated the mushy-bread-egg condition that sometimes comes with an overnight egg bake dish. I used Vienna bread and it was fine. My revisions for next time: leave the crusts on (that was time-consuming) and I may layer the top of the bread with thinner slices of cream cheese rather than the 1 cubes. Not everyone around my breakfast table was a big fan of cream cheese chunks. I also thought that I might try using raspberries rather than blueberries to see how that goes. All in all, this was a very nice change from the usual french toast or egg back recipe! 
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#This is fabulous! I use a 1lb loaf of day old farmers bread instead of 12 slices. This makes for a denser casserole.
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#Our family loves this breakfast dish. The recipe was shared with us by a friend following a Christmas brunch. We've since made it for family get-togethers and it is absolutely loved. We're now asked to bring it whenever we get together for breakfast. 
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#I've made this several times and everyone loves it, however for my taste I reduce the cream cheese to one 8 oz package. 
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#My whole family loved this recipe. When I took it to work to share, everyone wanted the recipe.
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#I made this recipe for a women church group for breakfast and it was awesome. Everyone loved it. I would be making it again and again. Yours recipes as great!
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#My mom made this once when I was a little girl, and I remember it at christmastime every year. I am thrilled to have found the recipe again!
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#This was a huge hit at family gatherings and a baby shower I attended. A great recipe!
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#Made for my by my aunt for brunch a few years back. I reach for this recipe often.
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#Here on planet Earth, it doesn't get much better than this! The Bomb! 
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#I added 2 cups of blueberries to the sauce and 2 TBL of Butter.
Blueberry French Toast#1#0#Made this for Mothers' Day brunch, and everyone loved it! I only used one package of the cream cheese, cut it into smaller cubes, and that was plenty. Don't skip making the blueberry sauce-- it was very easy to make and finished the dish very nicely. (We actually ran out of the sauce before the French Toast was gone!) I'll probably make the sauce to use for topping pancakes and waffles too. This recipe's a keeper! 
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#Made this for Easter Brunch. Everyone loved it. Would not change a thing!! Great!!
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#I made this for my daughter's birthday brunch. My family really enjoyed this. Because of time constraints, I didn't make the sauce and served it with syrup... but I definitely want to try it with the sauce next time. I would say this feeds 8-10. I used 1-1/2 packages of cream cheese but next time I will only use one, I thought it was a bit too much. Also used 10 eggs and it was plenty moist. I will make this one again on Easter, if not sooner! 
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#Great recipe..I made this several years ago. THe topping is delicious..I made this for my boyfriend, and we took it to work the next day. Everyone loved it, and raved about it! Would definitely make again!
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#Again and Again
Blueberry French Toast#1#0#This was absolutely delectable!!! I made this for a group of my friends and they devoured it!!! I used just a normal loaf of white bread and that worked just fine. And the sauce is the cherry on top!! Be prepared for it to take a little bit longer to bake then the recipe states...it almost took me an hour and 15 for it to start to brown.
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#This is the best. I have taken it to 2 family picnics and there was another one there and both were gone.
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#Delicious recipe. I used less eggs and had to bake for longer than the specified time. I didn't make the sauce either - we just used maple syrup. 
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#Made it for a work team meeting, received many recipe requests. I also add cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. I didn't have time to make the syrup but took along some Mrs Butterworth's, but most people said it was so good they didn't even need syrup. 
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#Very good - I made this for a family breakfast and everyone enjoyed it. I only used 1 package of cream cheese - and it was more than enough. I will make this again.
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#Great recipe. Not too sweet and a great texture. I cut the recipe in half for my family as I would have had enough to feed an army, but amazing recipe. A keeper!
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#I always make this recipe for our Easter Brunch. It is very easy and you can make it up ahead of time. Even if I wanted to bring another dish, this one is always requested.
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#was a bit hard to tell when done i am a bit o.c.d about doneness and making sure things are cooked thoughly. so mine was a bit over done...but still very good. i also halved the recipie and made this for me and my bf on xmas morning well i made it the day before and cooked it on the morning of xmas. love that its a make ahead deal the the syrpe that you make with the recipie is very yummy a bit bland as its just sugar and blueberries mostly but very very yummy. i would recommend maybe cutting the cream cheese up alot smaller than i did to disperse it a bit more but other than that i loved it and he was sick but tasted it and said it was very good def will be making this again and again especial for xmas morning fantastic breakfast or brunch idea or maybe even dinner :)
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#I have made this several times and it is a big hit each time. I add a little salt and nutmeg to the egg mixture and then sprinkle a little cinnamon on top. Super yummy and easy.
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#Our family has been making this on weekends and holidays since it was first published in the magazine. It's totally yummy! 
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#This is the recipe requested for birthdays, holidays and company. Easy, delicious and memorable!
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#This has been one of my all-time most favorite recipes since I found it in Taste of Home years ago! And it's insane the number of reviews that people took time out to do on this, which should tell anyone of it's wonders! This is in the Top Five foods of all time! 
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#this is HEAVENLY!!! perfect for christmas morning
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#This is our Christmas breakfast! I always use 1/2 the cream cheese. The last time I made this I put right in the oven (without the overnight soak) and I left out the syrup/honey. IMHO it was just as good... You can't go wrong with this one! 
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#This is what everyone in my family wants for their birthday breakfast/brunch. Guests always rave... Absolutely delicious!
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#I love the ease of preparation of this dish. Especially having it ready to bake in the morning. I may use only one block (8oz) of cream cheese next time, and cube it smaller so it will spread out more efficiently. Highly recommended.
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#I made this when we had out of town guests stay with us. It was an absolute hit!!
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#This recipe is so easy to make and is a crowd pleaser. It is great to make the night before so that the prep is so easy in the morning. I buy blueberry syrup to use instead of the sauce when I am short on time.
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#I made this for a mother's day brunch yesterday. My mom and my boyfriend's mom were meeting for the first time! I used Challah bread, and I mixed a little strawberry cream cheese in with the plain cream cheese. It was delicious! Everyone absolutely loved it!

Blueberry French Toast#0#0#I made this for Easter and it was loved by all!!
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#This is SO good! This will be on our Easter breakfast table every year from now on. I did make 1 little change in that I tossed the chunks of 1 pkg of cream cheese in a little sugar & cinnamon. Only about 1/3 c. sugar with 1 T cinnamon so not much sugar but the cinnamon was an especially nice touch.
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#This is sooo great! I made it for an overnight Scrapbooking crop and now my friends want me to make it again for next weekends Crop! Yummy!
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#sounds wonderful. always trying new ways for french toast. thank you.Lisa
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#I've made this as our traditional Christmas morning breakfast for about 5 years now and my children won't let me make anything else. It is fantastic and easy to make. We used frozen whole rasberries this year and it was just as wonderful. I find that a loaf of french bread cubed works great. Lana G 
Blueberry French Toast#0#0#This sounds wonderful.  I've saved it to try.  Thank you. Rosemary 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#80#14#Fat Free Half and Half is not Half and Half. It is skim milk and a lot of sugar. Heavy Cream or real full fat half and half are far better than the chemical storm known as fat free half and half. It actually should not be legally called half and half its skim milk and sugar. Devoid of flavor and substance filled with nasty chemicals and sugar. Why do we have an obesity problem in this country because of misnomers like this. dictionary says a wrong or inaccurate use of a name or term when speaking of fat free half and half.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#9#3#Is that the red or the white??
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#12#4#Used clam juice instead of water and added some Old Bay...Delicious!!! This is a good base for any seafood chowder.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#5#2#Excellent recipe.... delicious every time I make it :)
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#36#6#Double this, you won't regret it. I did make modifications when doubling. Tripled the clam juice and omitted the water. Then, used heavy cream instead of the ff half & half. I used just a little water at the end to get the right consistency, but not nearly the doubled 2 cups--just a cup to clean out that heavy cream in the measuring cup. I only had mini potatoes so I didn't peel, just cut them in quarters. The skins remained on and added a color to the mix. I also used Better Than Bouillon, Chicken Flavor which I think beats out granules any day. A hit at euchre night! 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#9#0#Followed the instructions right up until the end, then added an extra 10 oz can of whole baby clams (thanks Susan6620!) Chowder was awesome. Very filling with a side salad.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#5#0#Oh wow! Two thumbs up all around. I doubled the recipe and then added an extra can of clams just because. Thank you for this recipe
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#10#0#I made this recipe&only added some Red Pepper flakes&some Old bay seasoning extra&it is a Great recipe the way it is !??
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#1#0#I made this exactly as written. Soooo good! This soup will definitely be in the rotation often.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#16#15#I found a large can of fresh clams at Whole Foods in their refrigerated fish section for those that do not have fresh clams at their market and much better then those canned clams you find in the grocery canned meat section. If you have a Whole Foods nearby. Also, being a busy mom-I had a bag of frozen diced has browns and used those instead of peeling and dicing my potatoes-turned out every bit as good and saved me 15 minutes prep time. This was a tasty success for a cold winter evening. I made homemade bread bowls and hollowed them out to serve the chowder in. Toast the extra bread you remove as crotons to serve in the soup.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#4#1#I made this exactly as written. I don't like making alterations until I've tried it as suggested. I dislike reading reviews that change it all up! When you do that, it's a different recipe. Anyway, the chowder was good but not excellent. I've had a lot of chowders, especially in Maine, and they are delicious! I like a thicker, richer body and more clams. Wish I had access to fresh clams (at a decent price!) here in the Midwest. If you like a thinner broth, you'll probably like it.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#4#1#I loved this chowder! Admittedly, I made it a seafood chowder by adding clams, mussels, scallops and lobster and I made a double batch. It was delicious!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#3#1#This was delicious . Lots of layers with the flavors - beginning withe the bacon - to the potatoes to the onions to the clams . Perfect for a cold night. Raves from everyone who ate it.. Ready for me to make again.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#6#7#Haven't made it yet but want to use fresh clams, what is the ratio of fresh clams to canned clams? Looking forward to making this. Thank you. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#6#2#Absolutely phenomenal! As a family of four, everyone loved it. My 12 year old son says it's now his favorite meal and to make it often. He even asked me before he went to bed to make it soon. I think next time I will double it though. My picky eater daughter also ate the whole bowl.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#2#3#Delicious clam chowder we added two extra cups of water. It turned out perfectly.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#29#14#I usually don't follow a recipe for clam chowder, but because this was a Taste of Home recipe, I tried it. I used low sodium Better than Bouillon, used full fat half and half because that is what I had. I used yellow potatoes which basically disappear, which we like. I did add one more can of clams with juice. It was still thick enough for us. I also cooked more bacon to serve on top. It was wonderful! Definitely a company worthy recipe!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#45#16#I use Yukon gold potatoes, add white wine, butter and use big chunks of razor clams in this recipe. I also let it cook slowly for hours to let the potatoes cook down and the chowder turns a tan color. Every time I make a double recipe of this it's usually gone that night. Fyi... If you let the potatoes cook down you won't need flour. I don't know about you but I prefer it that way instead of having a potato soup like chowder 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#24#5#Great recipe - I use full fat half and half and less than 1/4 c of flour. I have tried it with and without bacon crumbles. Instead of the chicken bouillon I use Better Than Bouillon both chicken and the lobster type. Because I am using regular half and half I don't add it until the potatoes are done and heat through well so cream does not separate. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#24#5#followed this recipe to a tee. it was amazing (im from cape cod) thank you! :-)
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#55#46#Rate the recipe, not the tradition. I just got back from Maine where I had New England clam chowder in several different restaurants. All were a little different but delicious and they thickened with flour or corn starch. Just because you were brought up with a certain recipe, does not mean that what you had was the ONLY way to make it!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#37#3#Tried making clam chowder for the first time with this recipe. Absolutely a smash hit with the family! I forgot to buy clam juice but I substituted it with more chicken broth. Also added in some scallops to make up for the seafood taste. Really Really happy with how it turned out!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#19#3#This is very good. Hubby loves it. However, I used full fat cream, sauteed the veges in bacon grease that I save, and do not put bacon on top, just my preference, but I do love bacon. I put only one medium size potato cut in small cubes, I prefer less potato and more clams! I have made this 3 times since I found this recipe about 2 months ago...thank you
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#8#27#This clam chowder was good but not great . I didn't find the finished product to be worth the amount of work that went into it. It looked simple and it was but there was a fair amount of chopping. I served it with good bread and salad and we found that to be quite filling. I had some left and froze it. We'll see if it tastes better when I reheat it. I'm not sure I would make this again. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#1#2#Very good. I've been looking for really good recipes that I can use repeatedly and this makes the cut! Very versatile, easy to change up the ingredients with good results. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#4#0#I love this recipe. Thank you for posting it. I turn mine into seafood chowder by adding 2 cans of escargot and tiger shrimp. I also use my home made bone broths either chicken or turkey as I can control the sodium levels this way. I don't have to add any extra chicken bouillon. If I need extra salt I add 1/4 tsp of celery salt. I always have reserve bacon grease so if I don't have any bacon on hand it has the flavour in the soup already. It is nice to change it up once in a while. I also use this recipe for loaded baked potato soup because it so much easier. Enjoy! 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#17#1#I love New England Clam chowder and so does may family. I have ordered it in restaurants all over the US but never made it myself until I tried this recipe. This recipe was awesome! It was easy to make and tasted great. I followed the recipe exactly except I had one can of whole and one can of chopped clams. My husband loved the bacon on top, and I thought it was good either way. I will definitely make this again and again. Yes it does have a lot of sodium, and I may experiment with reducing that, but this recipe is better than most of the clams chowders in restaurants close to home, so this is a winner!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#6#1#I made this recipe and made some adjustments, and it was delicious! Since I smoke my own bacon, I sliced what would equal about four thick slices and chopped them before I cooked them until crisp. I used two small russet potatoes and real half and half. Instead of topping the servings with the crumbled bacon, I added it to the mixture at the same time as the clams. I served it with oyster crackers and Tabasco! Awesome!!! It was even better the second day heated slowly over medium low heat.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#6#1#I really want to try this recipe. The best clam chowder I've ever had is from Legal Seafood in Boston. I'd love to be able to make a good clam chowder of my own.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#13#6#Made this recipe with a couple of exceptions. I used 2 cups chicken stock instead of water and I used 4 good sized golden potatoes. This chowder was so good! Oh my goodness! I think next time I will put a smaller onion in. It was a bit sweet and I think it could only be the amount of onion used. But this was my first time ever making this soup. I was intimidated of it even though I've been cooking for 40+ years. It was so good and we loved it!!! I can't wait to variations of this chowder.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#13#1#Drained the bacon grease and sauteed the celery and onions in a little bit of butter. Boiled the potatoes separately in water and chicken bouillon until fork tender then used the starchy water as the cup of water in the recipe to add thickness
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#3#2#This was great and super easy. I used one can of chopped and one can of whole clams to give a bit more body. To keep the fat content down I used one cup (plain and unsweetened) almond milk. Gave friend recipients and she used whole milk and was delish!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#My homeade clam chowder tastes Sweet, too Sweet?? The only thing I didn't add was thyme (didn't have any) Is there anything I can do to make it less seet? 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#16#21#Number one- salt pork not bacon,no flour to thicken,no garlic ,no chicken stock. Use clam broth and evaporated milk and cream. And use fresh dill to garnish! Add clams at the last absolute minute or they will toughen! I am from Gloucester,MA and we know our chowder!!!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#7#3#I love soups and chowders, my favorite meals to cook. Made this *exactly* to spec with two minor tweaks: I had 3 cans of clams so I threw the third one in, what the heck. Then, at the end, a small drizzle of truffle oil  my favorite *secret ingredient*. Never overdo that, just a little drizzle, but the flavor/depth it adds to chowders is amazing. Result: 5-star, major raves all around.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#6#1#This recipe is fabulous! I added shrimp and scallops that I had smoked out on the grill the day before and turned it into a seafood chowder and it was off da chain!! I've made it with just clams, as well and it was wonderful. I love bacon so I added more bacon and I served it with scallions, bacon and cheese. I also added bacon to the chowder too, meaning I didn't just use the bacon as a garnish and that took it over the top! 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#4#1#This recipe was absolutely delicious! Fall came in with a roar over the last couple of days here in Washington, so I was looking for a hearty clam chowder recipe. I've made clam chowder many times and this recipe was close to how I've made it in the past, but with a few additions, like the garlic and thyme. I was hesitant at first to add them, but I gave it a whirl. Everyone raved about how good it was! I had to tweak it just a little to use what I had on hand. I didn't have half and half, so used heavy cream and milk and used fresh thyme from the garden rather than dried. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe! 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Best recipe ever! I did combo of baby shrimps and crab meat . Thank you
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#21#2#Same recipe I've used for years. All you tweakers need to start your own recipe blogs.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#2#0#Very good consistency and easy to make, but I think it needs more clam flavor. I will substitute another bottle of clam juice for the water if I make it again, and add more clams.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#1#0#I'm confused. Maybe it's my iPad? But the YouTube doesn't show anything besides the strips of bacon lying in the skillet ostensibly sizzling to the tune of Ian Post's Du Da. I'm going to give this a try. I just dug razors down here in Newport, Oregon.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#3#0#I followed the changes the lady with vermouth and deglazing with white wine and this is the BEST CLAM CHOWDER EVER!!!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#4#0#My family really liked this chowder. It is easy to make and very versatile. I've made this twice. The first time I made as directed. It was pretty good but I needed a little more flavor. The second time I deglazed the sautéed veggies with 2 Tb white wine before adding the broth and I used Chicken bone broth instead oF bouillon. I also added a bay leaf and 1 tsp of old bay seasoning in addition to the other seasonings. I added 1/4 cup of vermouth along with the half and half. The chowder was amazing.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#6#10#This is a nice base, but if you even have a little bit of concern for your health ( I know, we're talking a chowder here) this thing is an absolute salt/sodium bomb. I tried it as is the first time, and modified the next to bring it down. First, I know its delicious, but skip the bacon and sautee the vegetables in a little butter. Reduce the chicken bouillon, which is the main culprit of un-necessary sodium, down to just half a teaspoon. Switch to black pepper to amp up the flavoring a little and cook the rest as recommended. Incidentally, the modified version tasted much more like authentic clam chowder from New England. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#5#I just made this for dinner tonight. I added two cans of cream of chicken soup and an extra clam juice to it. I don't like to use flour if I can help it. Everything else I did exactly to the recipe. I liked it and will make it again. Thanks!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#2#0#From the household food critic. , this tecipe is BADASS I have made 3 times. 1st time to spec...gorgeous 2nd time, the food critic brought home heavy cream instead of half and half, so I used 1c whole milk and 1c heavy cream mixed together and then halved 3rd time I had 5 rashers of bacon and did not want to waste , so I used 5. ALL WERE EXCELLENT, CREAMY, T H I C K AND SATISFYING!! Best clam chowder EVER. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I love this clam chowder. Definitely the best I have made and I struggle to think of a restaurant clam chowder I liked better.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#this is the best Clam Chowder recipe i have tried.. i use 3 can of clam instead of 2, but last one just clam without juice. Already made 3 times and simply amazing. thanks
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#2#0#Made this last night which was rainy and cold(what's new in the NW) Very easy and yummy. Like others, tweaked a bit. 3 cans clams; twice bacon(come on got to have lots, put half into soup), added chives and butter(again duh). Didn't have white pepper so used good old black. A big chunk of garlic sourdough and the 3 of us finished it off. Will definitely make again! We know our clam chowder on the West Coast thank you very much. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Gorgeous! I followed the recipe and the video which was a great help, as I'm a novice, and it was really tasty! I love it and will do it again! Thank you! Diolch from Wales 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#2#0#Being from New England, I LOVE this version of clam chowder. No tomato base chowder for me . This is pretty similar to what I grew up with except we never had garlic or canned clams. It was always fresh littlenecks or quahogs.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Very good and SO easy. I didnt have white pepper or thyme which I think would make it better. My husband, who grew up in the green mountains of Vermont, loved it. The bacon sprinkled on too was a great addition.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I used 2 cans chopped clams,1 can minced 3 bottles clam juice half n half full flavored one chick bullion cube,big one mine turned out great.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#1#2#Just ok. I made the recipe exactly as published. Had very little sea food flavor. Noticed many of the positive reviews were from people who added/doubled the clams. Hard to rate higher if modifications have to be made to make it taste good. Also it never thickened properly which is OK if you prefer thinner canned soup consistency.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#1#0#My husband and I thought it was just okay.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Awesome
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#This was a super great jumping off point for those of us that can't remember the last time we've made Clam Chowder ??. I made this on a late night craving
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Absolutely delicious and really easy. I doubled the clams and eliminated the thyme and it was perfect. Dad ate two huge bowls and said it was the best clam chowder he has ever had. I will make this again!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#1#0#Recipe was good, next time I'll cut the thyme in half and increase the clams. Over all it was easy to make. It was my first clam chowder and I was super pleased. Looking forward to making this again.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I just made this recipe and it is absolutely delicious!!!The only thing I did different is that I used regular half-and-half. However after reading the reviews I might just try it with the fat free half-and-half to cut down on cholesterol I will definitely make this recipe again
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#3#0#I was really skeptical about the fat free half and half and flour in this recipe, but I've been on Weight Watchers and really craving New England clam chowder so I thought I'd give it a try. It worked like a dream, thickened up perfectly and tasted rich. No one could tell it was lower in fat. I also added celery with the onion, but otherwise kept the recipe the same. My family and guests thought it was great and finished every drop. In the past I've added a splash of lager or pale ale to my chowder (not canon, I know, but I like it) and I may do that with this recipe in future. It just adds a little depth to the flavor. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#1#2#So amazing!! This is my new clam chowder recipe. I had to make a few adjustments. I'm doing a no-spend month and I'm just out of some things. I didn't have clam juice but I had shrimp shells saved in the freezer so I boiled those for broth and used that in place of the clam juice and it worked good. I made a double batch. I also had less than half the onion called for, but I had green onions growing in my garden and used about a cup of those in place of one of the onions. I ended up adding 1 extra can of clams.. first reason was because I bought a pallet of them on clearance. Yeah. I thought it was a good move. And I wanted the extra clams because I was short on that clam juice. -- Also, I'm going to try it again lower carb by only using 1 small potatoes and then chopped cauliflower and I might try cream cheese in place of the flour. The seasonings in this are excellent. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#1#0#very good recipe, not too many ingredients and easy to follow directions. I did however make a few changes do to my liking of clam chowders i've had in the past. i added a small carrot finely diced. Instead of 1 cup water i added another bottle of clam juice since i was using fresh clams there was no juice. I also cut the bouillon down since i was using the extra juice. i also used heavy cream instead of half and half so i didn't need the flour. Sprinkled black pepper on top after it was cooked..It was a hearty thick creamy soup and i will definitely make it again. This is the second time i've made it so i knew it needed some tweaking. I also let me veggies and clams cook longer before adding the potatoes and broth. Served with oyster crackers,,It was so yummy! 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#1#1#It should be noted that the recipe says simmer covered for 15 to 20 minutes until potatoes are done. However, in the video it shows that the dish is covered while simmering for 15 to 20 minutes you might want to clarify that
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#1#0#Just finished making this and it's wonderful, not bland at all as previous reviewers stated. I also used chicken better than bouillon as the author had mentioned as well as a shake of Worcestershire. This is a keeper!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#1#10#Sorry but the Lady who said it's not New England is absolutely right ! Half the ingredients in this recipe do NOT belong in a true N.E. clam chowder, Thyme ? Chicken broth ? garlic ? bacon ? Half 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#3#0#This recipe was my baby quite a few years ago. It was intended as a healthy chowder. We all evolve in our cooking and these days I use ChickenBetter than Bouillion , umami, good splash of fish sauce and Louisiana Hotsauce.Shelby said the chowder was bland, I don't get that, and I'm sorry ,But when you want more rich use full fat half n half or whip cream add ,more bacon,add butter! And to the lady who says its not New England , I always thought New England meant white chowder and Manhattan is red chowder. It may have originated on east coast but we west coasters do some fine chowder too! ! And thanks to those that liked the recipe from the start!;-)
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#1#0#I made this Clam Chowder and I will make it again, the chowder was just delicious.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Just made this. From the sample taste, it is wonderful! Rich and creamy. I used 1.5 cups of heavy cream and i/2 cup half and half. Subbed basil for the thyme. Delish!! Can't wait for dinner to have a whole serving!! 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I followed the directions, no adding or subtracting, and this is the most tasteless chowder I've had. Looking through other recipes now to see what I can do to doctor it up. Will give it 2 stars for creaminess, but so bland. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#This is my family's new favorite Clam Chowder recipe! Absolutely delicious!! The only change to the recipe I made is I used heavy whipping cream ONLY because I misread the recipe. This recipe is definitely a keeper!! Thanks for sharing it. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#2#0#I followed this recipe to the extent my ingredients would allow. I didn't have half and half on hand, so I used a cup of heavy whipping cream and about 3/4 cup of milk, as not to make it too thick. Still ended up with a very tasty, very creamy, hit the spot soup and will be making it again! My only other tweaks were a pinch more garlic (because I LOVE me some garlic!) and black pepper. It was so delicious!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I followed the recipe with 2 exceptions, I used heavy cream instead of half and half and I added half a cup of fresh carrots. If using these exceptions make sure the carrots are in small cubes so they are done at the same time as the potato cubes. The heavy cream made the soup good and thick. The recipe is easy to follow and in my opinion one of the best clam chowders that I have ever tasted. Rates as good as any clam chowder I had in Bar Harbor.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#2#0#I noticed reviews that say not New England chowder with celery and thyme. From New England and always put in for great flavor
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Absolutely the best chowder I have made. The only thing I didn't have was thyme. But it was perfect anyway 5 stars!!!! 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#5#2#Why do reviewers always feel the need to tell the story of how many changes to the recipe they made? Just review the original recipe. If you want to describe your custom recipe, get your own blog! Anyway, great chowder 5 stars.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Great authentic tasting chowder! I used one cup of chicken stock and omitted the bouillon and water. I also found that it needed a little more liquid to thin out so I added more stock until I got the consistency I desired. It was delicious. Will make again.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#didn't use thyme in mine
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#11#I'm sorry, but you lost me at chicken bouillon granules....Really? You won a contest?
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#1#0#The family loved the recipe, I doctored it up a little bit by adding 2 bottles of clam juice, to go along with the 2 small cans of clams, also a 1/2 cup of white wine, a teaspoon, of Worcestershire sauce, 2 Bay Leaves, a dash of Tabasco, 1/4 cup of chopped carrots . It was outstanding the best I've ever made,Thanks so much! 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I have tried many clam chowder recipes over the years. This one is by far the best and most closely resembles New England or San Francisco restaurant style. I did double the amount of flour to make a little thicker.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Delicious!!! Very easy to follow
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I made a shrimp stock since I did not have clam juice ,used fresh clams out of the shell given to us from a friend in Maine ,added shrimp to the chowder and I used full fat half and half other than that I followed the recipe . This chowder turned out completely amazing .
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I have been using this recipe for about 2 years and my whole family loves it. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#1#My family loves this recipe! I substituted basil from my garden for the thyme.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#1#0#I'm not from New England so I can't offer that perspective, but I would say that this recipe makes a very great-tasting soup anyway! I used regular fat half & half and an extra can of clams. I did use the extra juice from that extra can as well. The soup thickened quickly and stayed that way, so adding the extra liquids made it just the right consistency for us. For our tastes, I also added about 1 Tbsp. of Kosher salt. Will most likely fall back on this recipe again when my son requests NE Clam Chowder. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I just made this recipe today and the hubby said it was the best clam chowder he had ever eaten! Can't get a better review than that! The only change at all that I made was just a little more garlic and a little salt and black ground pepper. It was so easy to make and tasted wonderful! 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#This is my third time following this recipe. I think it's great that there are more than one way to prepare NECC. Karen, my wife, and I love this one. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Love this recipe. It is quick and easy to make. I add the cooked bacon back into the pot instead of using it as a topping. Great flavor!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#2#0#First generation PNWer here. I made this for my finicky family who are all from Boston & New Hampshire so I was nervous making it after the reviews from the New Englandah chowdah snobs (believe me, my family is full of them) and guess what? They loved it! My dad has always been particular about his chowdah and he couldn't get enough! I'm not fond of razor clams so I subbed for some fresh local butter clams. I tripled the recipe to make for the whole family, not too much leftover but what was leftover I froze & it does freeze well! Thank you!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Great Clam Chowder. Used chicken stock instead of water. Would not use all the juice from the cans of clam or the half and half. The soup thickened nicely but was just a little thinner than I like when adding the juice and reserved half and half. Will be my go to Clam Chowder.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Came out pretty well instead of using water I use chicken broth for a substitute round 2 1/2cups instead of half-and-half used heavy cream and fresh parsley and Thyme for my garden
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#6#I am sure that to someone that has never tasted real New England clam chowder this might taste good, but there is no way this tastes anything like the chowder that we make in Boston or anywhere else in New England. You can call it Washington clam chowder or Northwest clam chowder or west coast clam chowder, but not Boston or New England clam chowder. We would never put celery or garlic or thyme in our chowder!!!!!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#1#0#Very good recipe and easy to make! I like how thick it was. Served it with cheddar bay biscuits.It was a hit!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#1#0#Very Good! I doubled the potatoes and used regular fat half and half. I had fresh clams, so I saut?ed them with the onion and celery.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Quick an easy recipe I made it for my family and did not have the potatoes and had to substitute dehydrated potatoes from a box of au gratin potatoes and I was delicious and much quicker to cook since I did not have to wait for the potatoes to soften.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Like this page a lot.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#This recipe had good flavors. It thickened up quickly to begin with but thinned out a lot after adding the rest of the half and half and the clams. I would maybe add less half and half or drain one of the cans of clams next time.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#This is a fabulous recipe! Great flavor and consistency. It's reasonably simple to make and many of the ingredients are things I have on hand in my pantry and fridge. I have substituted whole milk instead of half and half before and it's still good, but the half and half yields slightly better results. I like to add a handful of fresh chopped parsley at the end. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Was so flavorful im glad i made it. I served it with garlic bread sticks!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I substituted 2 leeks (mostly the white parts) for the onion, unsalted chicken broth for the bullion and added salt to taste. This is a great recipe!! Thanks for sharing.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I have a recipe I love and thought I would give this one a try. My old favorite is much better.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#This was the first time I made clam chowder and I made this for supper tonight. My family and I really liked it! I doubled the recipe, more than doubled the potatoes and decreased the half and half to 3 cups, instead of 4 cups with the recipe doubled.Thank you for the recipe!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#This was an excellent recipe for clam chowder. I did use 3 cans of clams which I drained and added the juice to the water for cooking the potatoes and did not buy 8 oz. of just clam juice separetly. I also used 1/4 instead of 1/3 cup flour because I did not want it too thick, it was perfect for us with 1/4 cup flour. I wish the reviewer from New England had been more specific in why she would not make this again. A negative remark with no explanation is of no help at all. Enlighten us please as to why you made it in the first place since you have stated it is definetly NOT New England Clm Chowder. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#2#Will not be making this again. Coming from New England, this is definitely NOT New England Clam Chowder.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Made Clam Chowder for the first time...glad it was this recipe. It was excellent. My husband & I couldn't quit eating it. Followed the recipe exactly except I added an extra can of clams, but drained them. Already planning when to make it again. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#My first time making clam chowder. I'm glad I chose this recipe. It was delicious. We like it a little thicker, so next time I'll adjust the flour and liquid accordingly. But it was still very good. I used chicken broth instead of water, otherwise followed recipe exactly.Oh, also, I added one carrot chopped into very small pieces. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#amazing my dad said it was like a restaurant.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I did make some minor changes but basically this is a great recipe. Great for a rainy day. I used fresh thyme, not dried. Used a small dice for the potatoes. I used whole fat half and half cuz I couldn't find fat free. I made the roux in a separate pot, using about 1/4 cup of flour instead of 1/3, and stirred it into the potato clam juice mixture. My potatoes were soft but a little teeny bit firm at about 12 minutes. I found that I didn't really need very much thinning at the end so I used only about 1/4 cup of the half and half there. Result was a lovely delicious thick and creamy chowder that is the best I've ever made. Served it with fresh baguette bread and butter. Hubs an I ate the whole pot and I had to make another the following day because we didn't get enough! Thanks for sharing the recipe. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#2#I don't like bouillon, so I eliminated it and the water and used chicken broth. DELISH!! Rushed for time one day, I bought my husband a pint of Clam Chowder from a local Seafood Shop. He said what you make is better than this!! A great review from him!! 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Made this tonight after seeing the favorable reviews. Followed recipe as is, except cut back on the 2 cups of half & half after so many said it was too much. I ended up using about a cup and a half. I thought it was good, and easy to make. Probably would give it a 3 1/2 out of a scale of 5. Next time I may try what ikenatr suggested...making the rue in my dutch oven before adding the liquids.Added note...since my first review above I have tried other recipes that I haven't liked as much as this one. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#EX !!!!!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I prepared this for a party of 50 yesterday following instructions exactly with the exception of the low fat 1/2 n 1/2. I used regular and cut out 1/5 of the recommendation. It turned out to be an ABSOLUTE CROWD PLEASER! I received favorable remarks all afternoon and was asked by several to add it to my menu. I doubt that I'll add it to the cafe's menu, but I will DEFINITELY offer it on the catering, There is no doubt about this recipe winning contests. Thank you for sharing it 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#As a working cook for over 7 years I was dubious about the idea of adding a flour slurry so late in the cooking process. Regrettably, I was correct. The flavor was overwhelmed by raw flour.I would suggest making the rue (that's what it is) in the pot before adding the liquids.You do that and leave out most if not all of the half/half then you will come closer to a perfect chowder.Other than those issues the flavor profile was on point. i look forward to trying this again while trusting in my instincts... 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I have been using the same chowder recipe for years and decided to try this one last night. I am so glad I did. It was absolutely delicious. I added extra garlic and carrots. I also used three cans of clams. I used one cup of half and half, as recommended by other reviewers, and the consistency of the chowder was perfect.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Great! I used fresh clams though.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I remember growing up in Hoquiam, Washington and having fresh razor clams when we were allowed to dig for the season. Living in Tennessee now it is not the same but making clam chowder is like being back home. Instead of using bacon in my clam chowder I use smoked jowl to saute my onions in. Next week I will be making this for my daughter's Tae Kwon Do masters. Since they are from Korea I am trying my best to cook things for their taste and when I mentioned clam chowder Master Park licked his lips and said he can't wait. I love cooking for them because so far I have not had one complaint from them about my cooking in American, Korean, Chinese and Italian Dishes. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#This makes a good chowder base but using canned clams and bottled juice leaves little clam flavor. Use fresh salty clams and you can skip the boullion.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Delish!Will be making this often this winterI did add a handful of shrimp, too.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#This chowder had a delicious flavor and I didn't think that it needed any added seasoning. I do prefer my chowder a bit thicker (and I only used 1 cup of half-and-half which was the full fat version) and I would definitely double the amount of clams used. I am particular about the taste of my chowders and usually, if there is something about a recipe that I didn't like, I won't even bother to remake it with changes. This recipe, however, I will make again with the added clams. Very tasty. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#This was silky and most delicious!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Excellent, and low cal, really enjoyed it
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Made exactly as is but used only one cup 1/2 and 1/2. Absolutely delicious!!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#This recipe is a keeper! I have never made Clam Chowder before and didn't know what to expect, I even doubled the recipe. My husband LOVED IT! It is a nice creamy thick soup that I will be making again. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I just made this and it's excellent. I have celiac disease so I used potato flour to thicken it up, and I have no bullion cubes so used chicken stock instead. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Had this for a Christmas get-together with my husband's golfing buddies & their wives. Everyone loved it. It is definitely a keeper for my recipe book. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Great recipe!! Creamy and yet light. I followed the recipe, however, I added another can of clams. Perfect with salad and baget Will make this a favorite!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Very good chowder. Poured off most of the bacon drippings, saved about 2 TB for sautéing. I used 3, 10oz. cans of Crown Prince whole wild caught clams. I also just used the juice from the cans, strained. The fat free half & half worked beautifully. I used white whole wheat pastry flour which worked well for thickening. Husband says to rate this chowder at 4 stars,I thought 5 stars!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#This was excellent!!! The difference is using the bacon drippings to saute the celery and onion.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Absolutely amazing. I'll be making this for years to come. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#This soup is so comforting. It's very flavorful and doesn't make you feel bloated afterwards. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Made this over the cold rainy weekend...absolutely wonderful...used 4 cans of clams and used the clam juice from the cans of clams instead of the bottled...amazingly delicious!!! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#This chowder was amazing! This was my first time making New England Clam Chowder, and this may be the only recipe I ever make. I was apprehensive to make other recipes because of all the cream and butter that they often call for. This recipe does not taste light at all and is still rich without all the fat. I made it as an appetizer, but this could easily be a main dish soup. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#absolutely great....even husband and grandson loved it!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#To Pickup2....I almost fainted when she asked if she whould add Tomatoes to make it Boston Clam Chowda.....as a Bostonion we would NEVER add tomatoes....that is known as Manhattan Clam Chowder with a tomato base! 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Fantastic !! I increased the bacon, served it Baked Potato soup style with the option of adding green onions, cheese and sour cream ...SOOOOO GOOD !
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I made it today and it was so yummy. My husband and I had to go for seconds. I did change the recipe a little i used regular chicken bouillon and regular half and half. And i followed the instruction the same way.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Great quick and easy recipe! I actually added a bag of thawed frozen seafood (scallops, shrimp, and squid) and only one can of clams and it was amazing!
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#1#Delicious! I need to know how to make the Boston Clam Chowder or do I just add some(few) tomatoes? Carolyn 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Absolutely Outstanding! Will make this over and over. Made a few changes due to personal preference or because what I had on hand. Used reg. Hickory Smoked Bacon. Used a Vadalia onion, added 2 carrots, sliced, used black pepper, added 1 Knorr homestyle chicken concentrate and reduced chicken bouillon to 1 tsp, probably would omit bouillon all together next time. Used 4 cans of Snow's minced clams, drained and used juice in place of bottled clam juice. Sauted carrots with onion and celery. Gave a bowl to my next door neighbors and 5 mins later they called and said this was Fine Dining, Restraunt Quality . 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#very quick and easy to make. Delicious taste. Definitely would make again. Only thing I did differently was to add a touch of Old Bay Seafood seasoning.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Outstanding! I used regular half-n-half since that's what I had on hand so no doubt higher in fat, but oh so good. This is by far one of the best clam chowder recipes I've ever had. Will be making this often, especially during the cold winter months. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Excellent chowder recipe. Very nice flavor.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#This is one of the best New England clam chowders I've ever tasted. Even my husband loved it, and he's not all that nuts about creamed soups. The only things I did differently was double the white pepper andstir the crumbled bacon right into the soup. This is definitely a recipe I'll use over and over again. Thanks!! 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Very good, but omit the garlic. I'd make it again. 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#This soup is amazing! I made this last night and even my daughter who will NOT eat soup loved it! I just ate some of the leftovers for lunch and it was even better than I had remembered. It was so full of flavor and I felt like it was from a high quality restaurant! You won't be disappointed! 
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#Made this last night. My husband loved it. I thought it was a bit too peppery, but that is easy to remedy. Loved how creamy it is. Will definately make this again.
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#amazing but used fresh thyme because dried makes it taste sweet I was giving this secret from a chef friend of mine & it made all the difference
Contest-Winning New England Clam Chowder#0#0#I've made this a few times and everyone that tried it loved it... and can't believe it's not full of fat! 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#5#0#Ann522~ yes I know the recipe you are talking about, it was made with a Jiffy cake mix. I always used a full size cake mix, it was WONDERFUL!!! Try looking on the Jiffy site! 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#44#2#Light and delicious! The directions were a bit confusing though...pudding doesn't come in 1-ounce packages that I could find (so I used a large instant vanilla pudding mix) plus the cooking time for a yellow cake was about 35 minutes, not 15-20. I may have used the wrong cake mix as suggested (I used a regular size yellow cake mix) because of the 9x13 pan. I also mixed the crushed pineapple with the pudding and cream cheese then spread it on the finished cake. Okay, I didn't use anything remotely healthy and went with full-fat cream cheese, pudding, milk, and Cool Whip. The end result was fantastic and I will definitely make this again. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#27#14#I'm surprised others have not commented on two aspects of this recipe: If you put the batter of a 9 oz. cake mix (Jiffy) in a 9X13 baking pan you are going to have a VERY THIN cake. And the part where you are supposed to sprinkle the pineapple on, then try to spread Cool Whip over that? Really? That would just make a mess, in my opinion. None of my ingredients are fat or sugar free or low fat. I used two Jiffy cake mixes. I was out of instant pudding, so I used the Cook & Serve pudding, cooled it and mixed it in with the cream cheese. The pudding blends nicely with the cream cheese. In a bowl, I folded the Cool Whip into the drained pineapple and spread that on, then added some cherries on the top. I skipped the nuts. It looks quite pretty. Haven't tasted it yet but it should be delicious. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#26#19#I would like this better with actual cream and sugar , not the chemical substitutes!! Don't care for the taste or texture of fat free milk either. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#23#3#We use to call this Banana Split Cake. I use banana pudding in place of the vanilla in this recipe. Then after placing cherries in center of each serving piece I would top with a light chocolate ice topping thru a squeeze bottle. These cake is always a hit!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#7#0#We make this with the Jiffy yellow cake mixes. We've made it many times and it's always a winner. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#13#0#I make a cake similar to this, with a large yellow cake mix, (I make it sugar free), after the cake is baked I poke holes in it and pour the pineapple (in natural juice) with juice over the top, then add the pudding (sugar free
Pineapple Pudding Cake#2#1#The only 9 oz. cake mix I know out there is Jiffy. The others are all 15 oz. or more.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#9#3#I've been making this for many years; however, I used the full fat/full sugar versions of everything except the milk. I only keep fat free milk on hand, so I will use that. Also, I will dispense with the maraschino cherries. Although I like them, they do add extra sugar. Nevertheless, I'm glad I encountered this recipe again. This will make a great dessert for my husband's upcoming birthday! 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#12#22#I will make it but I will make it healthier by not using poison for sweetening. Sugar only. No artificial crap that makes you anemic. Union of Concerned Scientists wanted crossbones on artificial sweeteners. Splenda takes the red blood cells down. My Mom ended up in hospital with severe anemia, I was borderline. Doc ordered me to NEVER use any of it again. so I will use the FULL fat, and calorie version. I want to stay healthy.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#6#4#Aren't most cake mixes more than 9 ounces? The name-brands are at least 15 ounces.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#2#0#I used to make a full fat version of this cake, but with coconut on top. I will have to try the low fat to see how it compares.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#19#1#We've made this cake four times now. Did it three times with pineapple and once with strawberries. The only change we made was, using one 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple, we used half of the can in place of water in the cake mix and the other half on top of the pudding mixture. It's been a huge hit at three parties with no leftovers!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#4#0#Made this recipe as the recipe stated and my family loved it! I will make this again.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#4#0#Made it as written, turned out great. Will make again
Pineapple Pudding Cake#3#0#Awesome awesome awesome it was so easy turned out really good can't wait to make it again. I changed two things I used French vanilla cake mix and half cup of silk vanilla soy creamer cause I ran out of fat free milk it came out great enjoy. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#4#0#Made this last week for the first time. It is addictive!! I used regular cake mix and coconut cream pudding. I toasted coconut to top with walnuts and cherries. looks sooo good. I made one tonite using chocolate cake and vanilla pudding. Haven't tasted that yet but will rate that as well. This cake tastes as good as it looks. Thank you for sharing! 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Great easy recipe
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Easy to make. Very light and refreshing. Made for dinner party and everyone like it--even seconds for some. Would definitely make again. I put shaved almonds on top and they tasted good on it.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#3#1#I make a cake like this except I use two 20 oz cans crushed pineapple I use the juice in place of water for the cake. I bake the cake then when it's cooling I take an 8oz cream cheese (soften) cut into chunks & 1 cup milk beat it till its pretty well broke up then add vanilla or french vanilla instant pudding(4oz) to the milk & cream cheese & beat till thickened.You will have some little lumps in pudding but it doesn't matter. Spread this on the cooled cake then put your crushed pineapple all over the top of pudding mixture then I put 8oz cool whip & top that with bakers angel flake coconut so good. :-) 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Scrumptious cake!!! I didn't put nuts. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#1#0#very nice recipe and cake
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#1#Awesome !!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#1#0#This was very good, but I'm not sure what I think about the cream cheese...That part was not quite sweet enough when mixed with only pudding and no additional sugar. Otherwise great! I think it would be good with strawberries instead of pineapple to compliment the cream cheese.I used the recipe as a guideline, but made my own cake and pudding from scratch, and no fat-free or sugar-free stuff. I also topped with toasted coconut instead of walnuts.We were not patient enough to wait for it to chill so it might be better cold! 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I made this cake last night for the family, since they love pineapple...Three cheers for this wonderful recipe. I even like it and I am not a pineapple eater. Thanks Kathleen for sharing!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#1#0#Took this cake to a family gathering everyone loved it. This cake is moist and YUMMY!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#My family loved this cake. It was refreshing especially on a nice warm day. The cream cheese and pudding..delicious. I will definately be making this again.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#good
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Everyone just loves this cake I have made it for family, friends and my garden club with rave reviews. A winner everytime!!!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#1#0#I make this cake all the time but I use a pineapple cake mix. More pineapple flavor that way.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#1#1#I made this cake for my brother's birthday,all the adults liked it because it wasn't very sweet and had a light texture,kids did not touched it because unfortunately they're used to the grocery store kind of cake,me,I did not liked the combination of the vanilla pudding and the cream cheese,next time I'll leave out the latter,it is a good recipe overall. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I did not go the healthy way of making this GREAT tasting cake. I have made this several times........great flavor and moist. It is a keeper at my house.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#2#0#I got this recipe years ago from a co-worker but lost it. I am so happy to find it because I could never remember how much milk or what size pudding to use. The original recipe I had called for a full size STRAWBERRY cake mix. My husband is diabetic so  I am going to try this with Pillsbury sugar free cake mix this time.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Fabulous dessert! I used white cake mix with diet Sprite instead of eggs & oil (and a touch of leftover pineapple juice). Following suggestions by other reviewers, I poked the top of the cooled cake with a fork and allowed all the juice from the 20-oz can to sink into the cake. Everything else went according to recipe. We can't get enough of this stuff! 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#this cake was yummy awesome ! 0:-)
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This was a fabulous cake! My 12 year old usually asks for a pineapple upside down cake on his birthday, but he said this year, he may ask for this one instead! I bought a regular sized cake mix and just split it in half (1.25 cups of the mix). I baked it cholesterol free by using egg whites and applesauce in place of oil. Then I followed the instructions as directed, except that I used neufchatel cheese instead of fat free cream cheese because it has even fewer calories, and then I omitted the walnuts because my husband doesn't like them. So with even less calories, I increased the serving size so there were 16 slices instead of 20. It was excellent! Even my 4-year old ate a whole piece! Very light dessert, not too sweet, and full of flavor and texture. We really liked it a lot. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This is a recipe we have made and enjoyed many times. Easy, tasty, lasts good in the fridge and healthy. Who could ask for more?
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#THis cake is very moist and refreshing.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This is definitely going to be a go-to recipe. Nobody can believe it is healthy. Make sure to use the small cake mix box (jiffy size), not the regular size.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I have made this cake several times, and it is definitely one of my favorites. It has been a big hit at family gatherings. I use white cake rather than yellow and omit the cherries.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#this is such a delicious cake and so easy to make! :)
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#very good recipe and its easy to make
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Wonderful recipe! The whole family enjoyed it. Great for those of us watching our weight. This is a very light, refreshing cake.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#1#0#I make a cake very similar to this - try this, when the cake comes out of the oven and has cooled, poke with a fork and put the crushed pineapple with juice over the cake, taking care to spoon it on all over the top to spread the juices over the cake. it does not get soggy at all! then spread the cream cheese mix over the pineapple and top with the cool whip. i like to top it with coconut for a more tropical take.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#1#0#For an even more moist cake, add one small can of mandarin oranges to cake mix. I don't like yellow cake....However, I LOVE this recipe....it's yummy! 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#great cake for pot lucks never any leftovers
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I TAKE THIS CAKE TO OUR WEEKLY GET TOGETHER AND WHEN I DON'T I'M ASKED WHEN WILL I BRING THE CAKE AGAIN. WHO WOULD THINK SURE A RICH TASTING CAKE WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I can't wait to make this cake again. My family loved it! I will recommend this recipe to everyone!!!! 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I made this cake for a potluck supper.   It went so fast I could have made two!!!  This is my hubby's favorite cake..   Truly it's a sure winner!! 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I used an 18 oz. pineapple cake mix, and used the juice from the pineapple instead of water. I made one layer of the pudding, cream cheese, and crushed pineapple, and pecans instead of walnuts (don't like'em). I made this for Easter, and it was such a huge hit that my mom requested it again for Mother's Day. Definitely a keeper in my diabetic house! Thanks for sharing! 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This is a great recipe. I also used the regular sized cake mix but used the new Reduced Sugar mix that is now out by Pillsberry. It turned out great. I also used sugar-free cool whip and tried it with cut-up peaches and it was GREAT! 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I made this for Easter (my side of the family) and got rave reviews. My brother in law came over the next day and had the left overs. Told me it was a keeper. So I made it again today. It looks and tastes great.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#AS IS only a 2 because there is no taste/flavor. I may make this again with these changes. 1) I'd put the pineapple juice in the cake in place of the water. 2) I may tried putting a 2nd can of pineapple in the cake to for more flavor. If that doesn't do it, then I could try the trifle as others suggested. This is something that feels light after a meal. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#1#Used a regular cake mix.........turned out as a nice looking dessert and everyone loved it.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#WHAT A NICE RECIPE AND A LIGHT ENDING TO A COMPLETE MEAL. I LOVE ALL THE SUGGESTIONS THAT PEOPLE MADE.NEXT TIME I WILL USE IT IN A TRIFLE.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#2#1#I can't believe all of the five star ratings for this cake. It was very bland and boring. The picture looked so pretty and the recipe sounded great, so I tried it. We ended up throwing out the whole cake, minus two pieces.Maybe it was the Jiffy cake mix, which I thought had a strange taste, I don't know. It may have been better if the pineapple was in the actual cake too, who knows. But it definitely needed something else. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#definately will make again
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#4/13/10 I made this cake for my husband's birthday. It was absolutely delicious and people did not say no when I offered them a piece to take home:) 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#1#0#Also used a regular cake mix.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#2#0#This was a huge hit with my co-workers. I increased the pudding to 2 boxes with 3 c of milk. Crumbled the cake and layered in a trifle bowl with the pineapple and added strawberries. Very pretty and delicious!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Absolutely delicious plus is a light dessert after a big meal.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#1#0#Jiffy cake mix comes in 9 oz. Have made this cake many time, except I buy pre baked pound cake instead of cake mix. I slice the cake, cover the bottom of glass 9x13 pan then follow the rest of this recipe. Also I do not use the fat-free or sugar-free, but thats just the way I am.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This cake was absolutely delicious!!!! Would make again, and again, and again, etc.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I MADE THIS FOR EASTER. IT WAS GREAT. I ALSO ADDED COCONUT AND I USED SUGAR FREE WHIPPED TOPPING.NEXT TIME I AM GOING TO TRY IT IN A SMALLER PAN SOTHE CAKE IS THICKER OR ELSE I'LL USE A FULL SIZE CAKE MIX. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I made this recipe for Easter dinner for my family. It was such a big hit! Very light, and moist and very easy to make. Will definitely be making it again soon!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#What brand cake mix comes in 9 oz? All I can find are 18 ox mixes.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I made this cake 3 times already since march 21,2010. Husband loves it, coworkers went crazy for it and I made it for the family for Easter and they loved it and all asked for recipe. Great lite cake
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Easy to make and was a hit with my family, especially my grandson

Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Wonderful light dessert! Nothing but compliments for this recipe. Will definitely make again!!!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I did modify a little, I squeezed out the juice from the pineapple and added it to the cream cheese/pudding mixture before adding to the cake. YUMMY
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#very very delicious and I used regular cake mix
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#A simple ,easy cake to make,that is very yummy
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Absolutely delicious. One of my goals this year is to lose weight and this will definitely be on my list of things I can eat. Took to a church luncheon and did not bring any home. Had several requests for the recipe.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Very easy to make. The taste is light and great for spring potlucks. Best of all, you can indulge without added calories. Excellent and delicious!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This was very good. My family thought it was delicious. I could not find a 9 oz.cake mix, so I bought the regular size. I also used no fat free products. By using the regular size cake mix, I thought there was too much cake, next time, I will measure out the 9 ounces. Other than that, I am definately making again.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I made this for potluck and I didn't get to bring one crumb home, so it was delicious.Definitely will make this again. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I fixed this for the 1st time for a group of women and it was a hit. Very easy and simple to make.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I also used Eggbeaters & it was perfect! I tried the roasted pecans, instead of walnuts. It was DEE-LICIOUS!!! Will absolutely make again!!! (I even dried the pineapple overnight to make sure it would not be too watery.)
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Excellent cake! I was suprised at how yummy this was. I usually never use FF cream cheese but the pudding really hid it well. I did use the 9 ounce cake (Jiffy cake) and it came out perfect!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I used a regular yellow butter cake mix.......2% milk, sugar free vanilla pudding, cool whip and light cream cheese and can of crushed pineapple.......why would anyone use less than a whole cake mix.that must have been a mistake. The Baker's coconut and walnuts, really topped it off. Didn't even use the cherries...even though i bought them. I think everyone likes it, because it is not too sweet as most cakes!! 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This was great!!! I used light cream cheese, low fat cool whip, everyone loved it!! I also added Baker's coconut all over the top! I have been asked to bring for Easter Brunch to family'. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#1#0#This is an awesome combination of light ingredients pulling together a taste beyond expectations. The flavors of pineapple mix very well with the yellow cake and combination of FF cream cheese and sugar-free pudding. Everyone was most impressed.The next time I make it I might try a white cake and ever so slightly increase the crushed pineapple, perhaps using 1.5 cans.As rated, this is a 5 star in the light desert category!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I couldn't find a 9 oz cake mix, so I made it with an 18.25 oz mix. I substituted toasted almond slices for the toasted walnuts. I brought it to work and every raved about it. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I made this right after I got the recipe and my family loved it. I will definitely make it again. LF from WA.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Substituted Egg Beaters for the eggs. Good to the last crumb including a granddaughter who is not a big dessert eater. Definitely will make it again. D from MN

Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#this cake is delic. and easy to make better the next day after being in the refigerator.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This cake was excellent; it was just perfect after a special roast beef dinner. I garnished with strawberries since they are my favorite.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#15 women at work loved it!! Light & refreshing. Will make again
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This cake not only tastes delicious, it is very easy to prepare. The cake is quite moist and still tastes good the second and third day. The calorie count is great and the sugar content is very low. I would recommend this recipe to anyone.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I made this for a large group of coaches. They really enjoyed this very moist dessert. I enjoy using buttermilk in all box cake mixes. This modification worked well in this recipe.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I used egg beaters and substituted half the oil for applesauce. The cake was so moist. EVERYONE loved it. This is a definite keeper. Even people who don't like cake, loved it. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Took this cake to a church pot luck. It was a winner!!Idaho-karen
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#My husband is not much of a cake eater, but loved this one. I am a diabetic and have a cholesterol problem and this recipe was great.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I have this same recipe and it is WONDERFUL! It always receive raves from my company.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This was delicious. I never saw a dessert in my house disappear so fast.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Awesome! I agree with the reviewer who commented that it stays moist in the fridge for several days. Will definitely make this one again. My guests loved it!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I made this as a birthday cake. Doubled the recipe. Instead of cherries, used strawberries all over the top of cake, omitted the walnuts. It was delicious.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I going to fix this cake next week for cards & I'm sure the girls will love it. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I forgot to tell you, the cake mix I used was a 50% reduced sugar with splenda, since I am a diabetic. 9grams
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This cake was simply delicious. Diabetics and dieters both loved it. I did not put the whipped topping on. I whipped the pudding and the cream cheese and put it on the cake and then the pineapple and nuts and cherries. Everyone said YUUUUUM!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Check your ingredients lists. Duncan Hines and Betty Crocker angel food cakes both have hydrogenated oils/trans fats.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#We both enjoyed this cake. It stayed very moist & flavorful for 5 days in the fridge!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#i made this cake for my father in law who is watching his calorie in take. He now said this cake must be made at all family get togethers! It's he's new favorite. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#What toppings do you use? Whipped toppings in tubs have hydrogenated oils/trans fats.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I have a similar recipe using angel food cake mix and a 20 oz can of unsweetened crushed pineapple mixed together and baked in a 13x9 pan. Then I add the toppings. This would be a trans fat free cake recipe. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I mad e this cake and my husband loved it! You would never know it was a healthy cake! He said just like my Auntie use to make, super moist . Yummy!!! 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#1#This was a big hit! I used a regular cake mix and made a layer cake. I used the pudding mixture and pineapple as the middle layer and put the whipped cream on the top and sides. Added the toasted coconut and everyone loved it! Definitely a keeper.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This is a great recipe everyone in house loved it which is odd in our family to get everyone who agrees. Will make it again.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#How does a cake with trans fats in both the cake and the frosting get a heart healthy rating??
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I have made this recipe many times but I add a can of mandrin oranges in the cake mix for a bit more flavor
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I have made this cake in one form or another for years and it is always a big hit with family, friends and co- workers.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This is fantastic, everyone loved it and yes I will definitely make this again.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Sorry, I used 6 ounces of diet soda to the 9 oz. cake mix, (I just measured half of a regular cake mix since I could not find a 6 oz. one.) You use a 12 oz. soda with a regular cake mix. Can you make this with a full cake mix or is it too high? Everyone raved about it, it is one I will make over and over again!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#1#This recipe is a 5 star ... sorry!!!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This us a definite OMG . Tastes sinful and a lot less fat content. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0# 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Fantastic, easy to make, great Easter dessert. I did not have vanilla pudding, so I used fat free, sugar free cheesecake pudding instead and loved it. I will definitely make this again and again!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Nice flavor and pretty presentation. I used a full-size cake mix in a 9 x 13 pan, which made for a very tall dessert.  I thought the flavor of the cream cheese/pudding mixture might be improved with just a little added sugar.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This is a lovely cake. I piped the whipped topping on top and it looked so fancy.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Jiffy cake mix is 9 oz. This makes thin layer hence the short bake time. Delicious!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Where do you find a 9 ounce cake mix???? I read the recipe over a few times because I couldn't believe you baked the cake only 10 to 15 minutes. I used half a regular cake mix since I couldn't find the 9 ounce one. BTW, I made the cake with the soda (Weight Watcher's) and no oil or eggs or water to make it even lighter. A 12 ounce can of soda with one box of cake mix, beat together and bake. You can use any flavor cake mix and any flavor soda, try them all. Yummy! 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I added a can of madrian oranges to the cake mix.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I have made this cake before. I use the drained pineapple juice as part of the liquid for the cake batter. I have also folded the crushed pineapple into the cream cheese/pudding mixture and then topped with the whipped topping! Excellent!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I used the cheesecake pudding, replaced all sugar free ing. added a touch of pineapple Kula. Was Great!! Thank you and your Momma
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This is for Labounty. A friend of mine makes a frosting out of a large tub of whipped topping and a package of any flavor pudding mixed together. The french vanilla is very good.You can do the low fat/sugar free version.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Husband does not like cream cheese. What can I substitute for it?
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This cake is Yummy with a capital Y. Try substituting a pineapple or coconut cake mix for the yellow cake mix. There are never any left overs.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I've made this cake for years but use a pineapple cake mix instead of yellow. Much more flavorful. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#My mother in law has made this for years and it is always a hit. You can substitute a can of cherry pie filling instead of the pineapple for variety. It's also quite yummy!!! 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I used to make this cake all the time, until I realized that box mixes (the ones I've looked at anyway) have hydrogenated oils. Does anyone know of a cake mix that doesn't have hydrogenated oils/trans fats? I stopped using cake mixes for this reason. Same with whipped toppings. They claim no trans fats but they have hydrogenated oils, which are trans fats! I only use the cans of topping now. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#This not only taste good . but easy to make and real pretty to serve or give as a gift to someone ..Thanks for the recipe
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Pineapple pudding cake turns out so light and airy, it's just plain delicious. It's a keeper for sure and one my family makes any time we have the ingredients. It's going in my recipe box as we absolutely love this recipe. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I have made this cake often, and is very good and moist. And is always gone. Even the crumbs.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I am allergic to walnuts, so I substituted toasted coconut instead. It is delicious!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Yes! This recipe is well known in our family too. We know it as Hawaiian Wedding Cake. No matter how big a cake I make, it is ALWAYS gone! Funny to watch how many linger around for seconds... and thirds..
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#1#It was a big , huge hit at our cook out last night. Everyone had seconds so I had to cut the remaining slices smaller! I had all the ingredients except for the marachino cherries and so I left those off since I didn't want to go out just for those. Definately a do again. 
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Very good!!! Moist and light. Perfect summer dessert
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I made this over the weekend and it was a hit. Cought my husband sneeking seconds. Not a crumb left. This is a family favorite now.
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Made this for bookclub and it was delicious. Took the rest to work the next day and it was a hit!
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#Sounds great, I am going to make it this week
Pineapple Pudding Cake#0#0#I made this cake with lemon cake mix, and it was yummy! Everyone loved it! 
Baked Tilapia#5#7#What are the materials needed for preparing baked tilapia
Baked Tilapia#5#0#Unless fish is fried, or oven baked with bread crumbs, my husband won't eat it!!! He gave this a big thumbs up. I didn't have capers, but wanted another taste in there with the butter and lemon. I sprinkled each filet with Old Bay Seasoning and skipped the oregano. Delicious and so easy!!! 
Baked Tilapia#6#0#I made this for my husband who is not much of a fish eater and me. He had two servings and said he would definitely eat again. Another plus is filets can be frozen and just bake awhile longer. And it didn't leave the kitchen smelling like fish.
Baked Tilapia#6#0#I make this at least once a week. So easy and so reliably juicy and delicious! Even if I leave it in longer while I finish my sides, it has never been dried out, never overcooked, always soft, flaky, moist & tasty.
Baked Tilapia#5#0#extraordinary! Light fresh and delicious. A hit with all ages!
Baked Tilapia#1#0#Yumm! This was delicious and super easy to make.
Baked Tilapia#8#1#Wonderful recipe! My husband's and my complements to whomever came up with this quick, easy, healthy and delicious recipe. We enjoyed it. 
Baked Tilapia#3#2#I didn't add capers. Add extra paprika. The seasoning is refreshing - different than any other we're used to. It's simple and, therefore, and good bang for your time. I used hake fish. 
Baked Tilapia#15#1#Excellent! Most delicious and simple to make. I even cheated and just dotted the fish with butter, squeezed the lemon and sprinkled the rest! Perfection!
Baked Tilapia#5#0#This is a wonderful recipe - and so easy! I used Italian seasoning instead of just oregano, and this was delicious! Light flavored and easy - this is my new go-to for tilapia AND flounder!
Baked Tilapia#9#5#This recipe is a favorite of mine for a quick tilapia dinner. I have subbed white wine for the lemon juice and it's soooo good. I actually prefer the wine to the lemon juice. I also upped the amount of butter/wine/spices by 50%. This has become one of my staples for a quick easy weeknight dinner.
Baked Tilapia#1#0#Came out delish ????
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This was so good and easy to make. I've even given this recipe to my aunt! 
Baked Tilapia#3#2#This was pretty simple, pretty straight-forwards. I liked the spices, but wanted more on top of my fish, so next time I'll increase that. I put as many capers as I wanted on top, so that part was delicious. I felt like there was a tad too much butter, but that's probably personal preference. Overall, a solid tilapia recipe that I'll probably try again with some tweaks. 
Baked Tilapia#3#0#This was wonderful! I have always cooked my tilapia in a skillet and decided I wanted to try baking it. I searched for a good recipe and this was the first one that actually appealed to me. I am so glad we tried it! We will be using this recipe a lot!!! 
Baked Tilapia#2#0#Been making this recipe since 2013 when I first started college and was a broke college student. Never used capers cuz I never knew what they were and never had them but even without those, this recipe is really good! It's very light and airy. Pair it with some rice and broccoli and you got yourself a quick affordable meal. Also, to the person saying this recipe is bland. I recommend using the lemon butter mixture before you cook them and when they come out put more of the mixture on it. This helps with the flavor. Btw if you're not a huge fan of lemons like me, I would probably use alittle less lemon juice than it asks for cuz the lemon can get pretty bold compared to the other flavors. This makes a great meal prep also!!
Baked Tilapia#1#0#Thank you Hope for sharing this awesome recipe. Quick, delicious, and easy clean up (BONUS!). I couldn't find my dried oregano, so I substituted Italian dried seasonings instead. It was awesome. 
Baked Tilapia#2#0#Just made this last night without the capers ( whatever that is LOL) for the first time. LOVED IT!!! Sooo good I'm making it AGAIN tonight LOL !!!! 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I have made this many times. I have added extra seasoning because the amounts listed weren't enough for me. Also, I have subbed the lemon juice for dry white wine a couple of times because I had no lemons. Very good either way.
Baked Tilapia#0#8#Very bland recipe. Throw some sriracha, honey, more pepper, onion, something! Save this recipe somehow someway.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This is the best tilapia ever and quick and simple to make.
Baked Tilapia#1#0#This is a fantastic recipe!!!!! Everything about it works wonderfully and the taste is FANTASTIC. I do not enjoy fish much at all and I especially usually don't enjoy the taste of tilapia. I've tried several recipes and they're'OK,' but this one made the fish taste terrific. I grabbed this recipe about an hour before I was to cook and was out of capers, so I searched for a substitution. My google search result recommened subbing with something tangy that has a bit of a bite to it, there were several options. I chose to substitute capers with a spicy baby dill pickle, all it took was one and it worked great! If you use a spicy baby dill, also, be sure to mince it up, really fine, because it spreads the flavor out evenly over the fish, when it's cut up tiny. The only other substitution I made was using 1 tsp fresh minced garlic (= 2 cloves), because I think it tastes better than garlic powder, just my taste preference. Everyone loved this recipe and I definitely will be using it whenever we eat tilapia, in the future! Well done, TOH! 
Baked Tilapia#1#0#Wow, Hope! These are the kind of recipes I'm always looking for! It's easy, but doesn't skimp on flavor. When my spouse was released from the hospital and needs to be on a bland diet , this was great! But there is nothing bland about it! It's just plain delicious! 
Baked Tilapia#1#1#If you are trying to eat healthier, don't use tilapia! Try another mild white fish. I used salt water trout filets. Was very good. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Really enjoyed this. I added some sliced olives because I had some open. Very tasty!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#We had it for dinner and was very very good and quick to make give it a 5 star mary
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Made this as written. My husband and I both thought it was ?? great, loved the capers. I will be making this again soon. I might add some chopped olives. Thanks for sharing.
Baked Tilapia#2#0#I used dill pickle chopped fine (same measurement) in place of the capers. Such a great recipe!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I'v been fishing for a long time around 50 yrs. so just a tip on how to make your fish tast better turn the fillets over flat side up and you will see a dark line running from end to end this is the blood line! it makes the fish taste strong so remove it by slicing it away then turn it back over and make sure its gone there might be a little left on the bottom edge i'v shown friends this and every one has thanked me as they liked the taste of there fish better 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#what can i use instead of capers????
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Followed as is. Only put capers on half to follow kids choice and sprinkled a few green onions on top. Crazy good.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#My family loved it. Such a quick and simple meal!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I tested out this recipe for the first time. I'd omitted the capers and scaled back on the butter, lemon juice, garlic powder and kept the salt and paprika as is. I used Italian seasoning, crushed-about 1/2 tsp. I used a smaller pan (an 8-inch square baking pan, coated with non-stick cooking spray. I used 1 Tbsp. to 2 Tbsp. sweet pickle relish in place of the capers. The butter, I'd used 2 Tbsp.-the lemon juice, I'd used 1 to 2 Tbsp. and garlic powder I'd used 3/4 tsp. I baked fish for 15 minutes. This is a very tasty dish! It's moist, too! The sauce adds a nice flavor! delowenstein 
Baked Tilapia#0#1#I also added a few dashes of Old Bay . This was very good. I will be making it again. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I have made this several times, I add a few dashes of Old Bay Seafood Seasoning to each filet prior to the capers, as well as all the seasonings according to the recipe. It really turns out flavorful and great! My husband and I love this recipe. It's a keeper!! 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This was a fantastic, easy recipe. I usually bread and fry my tilapia. This was actually easier, healthier and tastier than what I am used to. I could actually taste the tilapia, rather than just smothering the tilapia with tarter sauce and not actually tasting the fish. A great recipe.Thank you.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I lost this when I gave my sister my cookbook! So glad to have it back. So easy So good. Even my picky BF loves it. Thank You. I double the sauce and top pasta with it! mmmm
Baked Tilapia#0#0#The flavor combination wasn't our favorite. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This has become a weekly staple in our house for Meatless Monday. Full of flavor and I pair with some saut?ed zucchini and wild rice. Crowd pleaser!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I wasn't a fan of baked fish.... Until tonight! I added lemon pepper but followed the other instructions and it came out very good!!! 
Baked Tilapia#0#1#I replaced the seasonings with Old Bay seasoning. Followed everything else exactly.Perfect
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Delicious! Used lime instead of lemon and Hungarian sweet paprika for a little added bonus. My wife was dipping fresh tomato and lettuce in the leftover sauce. Bling. Bling. thanks!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#My husband made this easy recipe and loved it!!,
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I left off the capers and the oregano since this was a first for two young boys. They ate it with no complaints and it was an easy and tasty dish for adults, too. Use a glass baking dish since the lemon juice can scar a metal dish. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I don't eat baked fish but since I'm trying eat healthier I decided to try this dish...it was absolutely delicious. The taste lemon-garlic butter was perfect, I paired it with mixed veggies and sauteed red potatoes! 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#It was fast and very good! My husband gave it 4 1/2 stars...he doesn't give anything 5 stars so those 4 1/2 are as good as 5 for the rest of us. I baked sweet potatoes and broccoli with lime juice, instead of salt, for side dishes. I'll be adding this to my regular quick dinner nights. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Excellent, easy and quick! I didn't use capers, and I only had about 1½ tablespoons of lemon juice, so I substituted 1½ tablespoons of juice from a jar of dill pickles. It was a weird thought, sure, but it worked great! Will definitely make this again. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Delicious! Loved the lemon flavor and the simplicity of the recipe.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Amazing! Found this a while back and I have made it SO many times now. I am a HUGE fish lover and this is my favorite recipe so far. Quick and easy too!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This is basically a fish picatta. I adore picatta, so I loved this!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I've made this twice and have yet to try it (I'm a vegetarian), but my husband loves it! Said it's the tastiest fish he's ever had! 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#love the flavors of this! Quick easy meal.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Very flavorful dish for such a simple recipe. I made as directed. I used a smaller baking dish so that this fish touched each other without overlapping. I wanted the sauce to completely cover the fish . So easy! Definitely will make again. Thank you for sharing the recipe.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Loved it. Easy and quick. I omitted the capers since we don't like them and didn't need it. Will definitely try again with different fish. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I grabbed this recipe quick, found I had all the ingredients and made it. So glad I did! Hubby gave rave reviews and we'll definetly have it again. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#It was easy, quick, and tasty. I left out a tablespoon of butter and it was still delicious... I will be definitely making it again!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This recipe was super easy to make. Drove my husband crazy with the smell and ended up having dinner earlier than usual. I would make this in a heartbeat again. Thank you for posting it! 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Yummy and easy, I think it needs more salt for next time. Stayed nice and moist.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Very easy, quick, and delicious. I will make this again.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Very easy to make, plus very tasty!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#So easy and really good. I left off the capers b/c we don't like them. Really good and easy week night meal. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Made this for my son & husband on the BBQ grill & they loved it! I placed the fish in foil tents, poured the butter sauce over the fish, added cherry tomatoes and cooked on the grill for about 12 min or so. Served with Quinoa/brown rice mix & grilled zuchinni with a homemade Thai mango dipping sauce. Very healthy & delicious dinner that the family LOVED!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Had 4 Tilapia fillets and wanted to make a healthy but delicious meal. Tried this one, using only 1/2 the butter and upping the lemon juice and capers and voila! AWESOME! Will definitely make this one again. A+++
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I love Tilapia and capers
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I have made this dish three times in the past two weeks! I have added spices and wine to suit my tastes. It's a simple recipe that can be enhanced many ways. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Excellent!!!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This was absolutely delicious! The only change I made was minced garlic instead of powder. Awesome taste!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Very good.the capers (the 1st time ive heard of them) really added a nice tartflavor to the fish.
Baked Tilapia#0#1#This was really good, even with using bottled lemon juice (I ran out of lemons). Definitely will make this again.Added bonus- since I usually only make 3 fillets at a time, this works perfectly in an 11 x 7 pan and baked in my toaster oven. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I was out of parmesan for my regular tilapia recipe.. so i tried this one. I had no capers, but used all the rest of the ingredients. Another good recipe from Taste of Home!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#My favorite tilapia recipe!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Very delicious! I didn't have the paprika but it turned out just fine without it. It was a little colorless which I assume was because I omitted the paprika. It did need more salt but it was still tasty as is. I will definitely make this again! 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I only have one picky fish eater in the family and even she loved this, fast, lovely taste and perfect for a light easy meal! Love it :)
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Used it to bake Swai. It was awesome. Melts in your mouth. Absolutely no fishy taste will use on differenttypes of fin fish
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Love it! Also good with Cod. Will try it this summer with Lake perch and Walleye.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Wonderful, melt in your mouth, buttery flavor with just a hint of lemon. Seasoning is PERFECT! Fast to make. Thawed individually vacuumed wrapped Tilapia in cold water for just a short time to thaw and had this on the table in no time at all.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This was a big hit for my family. Even my daughter who is a very picky eater loved it
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Easiest yet best tasting recipe using Tilapia that I have ever made. Only thing I changed was to season the filet with the garlic powder and salt instead of mixing it with the butter and lemon. It was perfect! I will say that buying fresh Tilapia versus previously frozen fish will make a huge difference in taste.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#ok for healthy food
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Made this last night. My husband isn't a big fish eater, but he loved it. Will make again. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This was tasty! So easy to cook with a short amount of time involved. It definitely will be a staple at our house.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Great flavor. I fell in love with capers because of this recipe.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I eliminated the capers as I don't like them and I forgot to add the butter after melting it in the microwave, but it still turned out great! It was very light. The bonus was how easy this is to pull together for a meal. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Very good, even though I didn't re-read how to make this. I just tossed EVERYTHING in with the butter, Dah! Cooked for 12 minutes, perfect. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This is one of our favorite seafood recipes. We really like it with the recipe for roasted potatoes and artichokes.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This is a quick and simple way to prepare fish. I enjoyed the fresh lemon juice and the salty capers.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This was very good and had a great taste. I think I would make it with olive oil instead of butter so it would be a healthier recipe.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I made this recipe tonight for dinner. I wanted to try it because it has capers in it and I had never cooked with them before. The fish was good but I thought it was lacking a little something...I am not sure what. If I tried it again I would probably try to add another an additional spice to it. But hey I am just a beginner. lol
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I am not a big fish eater, but I love this recipe. Plus, it is so easy to make. My go-to meal when hosting a vegetarian for dinner.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This is my favorite tilapia recipe I've made yet. I wasn't sure about the capers at first and think I'd use a little less in the future, but otherwise the flavor was really good. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#It is very tasty and lite.I will difinately be making it again.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#We liked this a lot, and will definitely make it again! I am always looking for new ways to use tilapia since it is so affordable and adaptable. Was thinking of maybe browning the fish quickly on both sides next time, just to give it a more pleasing eye appeal. Thanks to Hope Stewar for submitting the recipe.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This was okay, nothing special. BUT~ I don't think I used enough lemon, also think it might be better with a thicker fish. Thanks for sharing. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This is a delicious way to make a quick fish dinner. We eat this once a week. Sometimes I add dijon mustard for some zip!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Fish is not my favorite thing but since we need to have it a couple times a week - this is one recipe I can use to make it okay enough to eat it! For people that aren't fish eaters, use milder flavored fish such as cod, tilapia, mahi-mahi. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Very easy, quick and great flavor every one enjoyed and and had seconds !!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#My husband is a very fussy eater. When I tried this recipe on him, he said this is delicious - make this again. I loved it because it was so easy.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Yummy - very easy and oh so good!!!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Delicious! Mine was very pale after the 15 minutes in the oven, so I broiled it very briefly. Yummy! I'll make this again and again! 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I'm not a huge fan of tilapia, but this dish is excellent! The capers compliment the lemony sauce. My family loved it and I will be making it again! 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I am not a cook. I rarely cook anything. Also, I generally do not like fish. I started a low calorie diet and decided to try fish again. This recipe was so easy to make and the fish turned out great. My fiancée and I both really enjoyed it!!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Since tilipia is an economical and mild fish I'm always looking to new ways to prepare it. This is very quick and delicious. The sauce also works well for chicken. This is a winner! 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#My husband didn't care for tilapia untill I tried this recipe, now he raves about it. I did use a little more lemon juice just because I was not too exact measuring. It was tasty, the capers really brought it to life! 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I make this over and over... we love it.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#this is very good i have made it twice very good and very easy to make cant get enough of it thank you.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#We love this recipe - so easy and so flavorful!!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#For a fish recipe, this was okay. I have tasted better, but I wouldn't discourage someone from making it. It is good, just not great. Next time I will follow the advice of tho1324 on the comments, and try marinating it in lemon juice first. Since I will be doing that, I will probably use an additional Tbsp of lemon juice. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Wow! This was an amazingly easy and DELICIOUS way to fix fish. The sauce tastes exactly like the Chicken Piccata sauce from my favorite Italian restaurant. I will definitely be making this one over and over!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This was my first attempt at making fish. I don't eat fish often but am trying to start eating more of it. I chose this recipe because of ease of preparation and its use of capers (I love them!). It really was a very easy preparation. The result was great! The combination of lemon with the spices was very fresh-tasting and the paprika gave it just enough of a smoky flavor. I will definitely be making this again! 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This recipe was pretty good. Instead of capers i used pepper.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This is now in my Favorites cookbook. So quick and so delicious. I plan on trying different types of fish with this recipe.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I didn't have capers, so I just left them out. My husand and I loved this. The fish was tender, and the flavor was just enough without being overpowering. Great with aparagus. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I made this recipe in my electric skillet, rather than using my oven. The fish cooked in a flash and we were sitting down to eat in less than 1/2 hour from start-to-finish. Went great with green beans amandine, too!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This was delicious! I didn't have tilapia, so I made the recipe with sole, and I doubled the recipe for my larger family. I also used dill instead of oregano. The sole had a lot of water in it, creating so much liquid that the fish was more poached than baked. When it was done, I thickened all the extra liquid with a little cornstarch and drizzled it over the fish . Oh my gosh....it was so good! The combination of butter, lemon, dill and capers was fantastic! We will definitely be having this for dinner again soon! 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This is an easy and yummy recipe!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I fix this recipe about once a week. I use a little less lemon juice, omit the oregano and use dill weed instead. My family loves it.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Easy, delicious and healthy! I used salmon and 1 T. pineapple juice for some of the lemon juice. Yum!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Excellent recipe. My husband loved it. I'll definitely make it again. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#The recipe was good, but did not have the flavor I was expecting...I would push lemon juice on the fish first or would use a balsamic vinegar to marinate fish along with cilantro first then continue the recipe.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#This recipe was terrific. I will make again and again and again.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Has anyone figured out the nutrition facts for this recipe?
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I made this last night with mahi mahi, and it was great! I'll try it again with tilapia, which I'm sure will be great, also. I imagine this preparation would be good for any kind of fish fillets. 
Baked Tilapia#0#0#re: Tilapiait is a sweet mild white fish that melts in your mouth you can also cook it in the microwaveiclue
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Tilapia is a w2hite flesh fish,sweet,light texture,bakes or fries quickly,good hot or cold,cheap and tasty. You can add just about any topping you think of, Breaded,dipped,sprinkled ,just go with your feelings...enjoy!
Baked Tilapia#0#0#I have seen Tilapia in the grocery store for a long time now, but never tried it..What is the flavor and texture of this fish..anyone??
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Slight correction on definition of capers... Capers are the unripened flower buds of Capparis spinosa, a prickly, perennial plant which is native to the Mediterranean and some parts of Asia. After the buds are harvested, they are dried in the sun, then pickled in vinegar, brine, wine or salt. The curing brings out their tangy lemony flavor, much the same as green olives.The size of the buds range from tiny (about the size of a baby petite green pea) up to the size of a small olive. The smallest variety from the South of France, called nonpareil, is the most prized and comes with an equally notable price-tag. Larger capers are stronger in flavor and less aromatic.
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Capers are a smale olive that have a lot of punget flaver so you can you menced green olves in place but the flaver will be more fishie tast this makes more salt to it i like more pepper spices to it in sted like chilly power or dryed itallion seasons
Baked Tilapia#0#0#Has anyone tried this with another type of fish...such as cod?
Baked Tilapia#0#0#What are capers? Can something else be substituted so I can make this tonight?
Baked Tilapia#0#0#My kids 6 and 2 ask me to make this for dinner!! We LOVE it!!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#5#0#Question- There used to be a step where you dripped hard choc designs on the top with this recipe. What was the directions for that, please?
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This cake was the best one ever. I would like to know how to make it with white cake recipe, can someone help.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#My brother put a wonderful cream in the middle and it was decadent! The most delicious chocolate cake I've EVER tasted! I ALWAYS request this cake for my birthday! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#2#Super great recipe! The cake was delicious, and my family loved it. The only thing I would change is the butter in the frosting, just because I thought it was a little much. It made a lot more than I needed, so next time I'd reduce everything by half. Other than that, perfect!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#3#0#I skipped the frosting all together and just dressed it up with ganache dribble, centered with strawberries and blueberries. I skipped the oil and did it with applesauce. What a beautiful cake. I wish I could post a picture. I'm proud!! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#1#0#I made this cake for an auction. The cake itself and rich and decadent. The frosting seemed more like a mousse to me. It wasn't too sweet but airy. Nothing to add on the ganache and strawberries. They are what they are. The auctioneer saved this to be the last thing auctioned off because it looked so good. It sold for $150. Wow!! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#which cake mix is good - Duncan hines devil food or Williams Sonoma degvil food or something else for this recipe alone?
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Awesome, super moist & chocolatey I added strawberries to eat I definately think it was the best desssert at the party. Will make again
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#2#0#I started making this recipe in 2010 when I was it in the magazine and haven't stopped! It is very rich so I only use a single layer at a time. The cake (minus frosting) also freezes very well. Then I can thaw the cake and frost it for an easy item to bring. I make 1/3 of the butter frosting recipe for the single layer, but keep the ganache the same. I top with a variety of fruits including strawberries, raspberries, blue berries & kiwi. Each single layer piece is still packed with flavor and allows for more servings with a large party. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#1#0#I've made this several times. Very moist and delicious. I did only use 1/12 cups of real butter. It worked fine. The presentation was fabulous! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#10#No way too many calories for one slice of cake!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Of all the desserts I've made - this one is the one that has been the biggest hit! Amazing frosting on this cake, and don't skip that ganache! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I made this cake for my son-in-law's surprise birthday party. It was a hit! When we brought it out, got lots of ooohs and aaahs. It is a beautiful, impressive, delicious cake and is easier than you think. I put it in the refrigerator the day before and added the ganache and strawberries the day it was served. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#The actual cake was delicious & moist. The icing was just too buttery tasting for me with the 4 sticks, however the spreading consistency was perfect. I will use my own chocolate buttercream frosting next time. I placed chocolate covered strawberries around the top and on the sides. It was a big hit with the family!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#1#0#Delicious. I might add sliced strawberries in between the layers next time though.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Deeelish! A frieND made it for my birthday and WOW! I'll be making it for dad's birthday! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#1#this is really good. I made it in 13x9 pan because I had to travel with it and didn't want to worry about it falling over. the strawberries at the store weren't looking that good right now so I used canned cherry pie filling, which was great. I just drizzled the ganache over the top of the cherries . I'll make it again with strawberries when they're looking better. the frosting was great. for those of you who complained about the butter, you should try it-it's very good. The one I made today was for a party at work and I'm making another one tomorrow to take for Christmas eve dinner. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#1#0#I made this for my daughter's birthday. It was amazing. I have been baking for 50 years and never expected such deliciousness from a recipe based on a boxed cake. The frosting was decadent. Instead of making the chocolate lace for the top I used chocolate covered strawberries. I am going to try alter this recipe to make a white chocolate cake. For anyone thinking of trying this recipe...DO IT YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#If I could give this 10 stars I would! My cakes turn out just like the picture and are absolutely wonderful!! Because it is loaded with calories, I save this for very special occasions!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#1#0#Delicious! I used white chocolate flakes as a garnish instead of melting chocolate and making designs. And I used store bought frosting. The cake I followed the recipe exact and it was sooo good!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I know it's a strange question, but what do you consider a regular size cake mix? Because I'm from the Netherlands, and I don't know if our cake mix is the same size :) But it looks amazing and I can't wait to bake this cake! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I made this for our Christmas Day dessert. It was a hit! I loved making this beautiful cake. The chocolate swirls were so easy and beautiful. Everyone was in awe. Thanks for such a great cake!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Does anyone know how to convert this recipe to yield 18 servings in a sheet cake shape instead? Please help, baby shower in less than a week!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#1#This has to be the BEST cake I have ever had. I made this for a family gathering. I followed directions exactly and it came out perfect. It even looked like the cake in the pic. Everyone at the party commented on how delicious it was. (even my Sister that is the district manager of the Bakery's for a very well know grocery chain that trains employees)I am wondering if I could make a vanilla one using this recipe and subbing white cake mix and white chocolate chips... I think I'll give it a try. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This is an incredibly dense, moist & delicious chocolate cake! It is similar to a recipe I got years ago for a bundt cake but this version uses less oil and works for a layered cake. Highly recommend!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This cake was delicious. My whole family loved it. It was easy and quick enough.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#1#0#OK, so I teach high school culinary & one of my students chose this recipe for our rodeo baking contest. Not only did she win 1st place in her division, she won best of show & the judges were asking for the recipe. The only change we made was the frosting; we used the Wilton Buttercream Icing recipe & it was perfect.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I have made this several times and it is excellent! I've made both cupcakes and cakes using this recipe...the only problem i have is that the cake always falls once i remove it from the oven...does anyone else have this problem? I tried lowering the oven temp to 325 and baking it a few minutes longer but it still falls...any suggestions? 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#1#Love, love, LOVE it!!!! only change I would make is using Chocolate Mouse for icing, color and taste work perfect with the rich Ganache!! remember, DON'T put the piped swirls in the freezer to set them, they will be too soft at room temp. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#LOVED IT
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I have been making this cake for over a year now. Lets just say anytime one of my kids or nieces or nephews have a birthday coming up they ALWAYS request I make this. I have doctored it occasionally substituting strong coffee for the water, & 1 TBL of coffee liquor & 1 tsp of instant coffee grounds to the cake part. I have also added the liquor to the frosting & ganache. I don't drink coffee myself but it really brings out the chocolate flavor! I have also substituted the strawberries with raspberries if they look better at the store, I have also added raspberries in between the layers & I have chocolate dipped them on occasion to change it up a bit. Once you make this you will make it again~ Enjoy! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I first had to make this cake for a christmas party. People loved it and I have been making it ever since. For the past couple years everytime someone has a party they call me for this cake. It is delicious. Very rich. Easy to make and it looks like it takes forever. I haven't met anyone who dislikes this cake. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#My family loves this cake. I have made it for birthdays and as a grooms cake. I wish I would have thought to dip the strawberries first, because that was my only complaint-that the berries release their juices when they touch the frosting. I will continue to make this cake...fantastic
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This is the most chocolate you can get in 1 recipe. My husband doesn't like chocolate, chocolate, chocolate anything, but he loved this cake. the cake it's self was so moist and the frosting I now make anytime I want choclate frosting. I've made this cake for a baby shower, and my church, everyone who tries it loves it. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#1#0#Not giving it 5 stars because the frosting is just too much for this cake - too sweet (and trust me, I love chocolate!). I put this in a bundt pan and drizzed the ganache over the top. Used the berries as a side garnise as well. No need for the other frosting - was amazing without. And, much simpler!!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I made it with raspberries and it was amazing! Much better than the strawberries.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I made it with raspberries and it was amazing! Much better than the strawberries.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I made it with raspberries and it was amazing! Much better than the strawberries.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This cake was delicious and everybody loved it. But I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong with the frosting, it comes out too soft. How many sticks of butter should I be using? 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This cake was delicious and everybody loved it. But I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong with the frosting, it comes out too soft. How many sticks of butter should I be using? 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This was so delicious!!! The combination of chocolate and strawberry is amazing and I got many compliments on it! The only problem I had was with the chocolate garnishes, I got them made and on the cake but they got all droopy and wouldn't stay up after only a couple minutes. Also if you make this in advance I would follow GeorgeAnne's advice about dipping the strawberries first because I didn't and they did leak onto the frosting, but it was still delicious :) 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#1#0#This caught my eye when I was looking for a cake to make for my mom's birthday. Amazing! Made it a few times since then and have gotten a few (joking) marriage proposals because of this cake, it was that good! So rich and decadent. I used frozen strawberries because they looked prettier. And I did notice that I had way too much frosting. If you want to make this cake even easier than it already is, just get some basic milk chocolate frosting (I used Betty Crocker) and use that instead. Tasted exactly the same ;) 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Should clarify on the frosting..when I make the 9 inch cake I cut the butter in half. I make the full pound of butter with 8 cups of confectioners sugar and 1 1/2 cups of cocoa when I make a 12 inch layer(double the cake recipe)cake. Plenty of frosting for the big cake.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I have been making this cake since in appeared in the TOH magazine a few years ago. It is the most requested birthday cake in my family. Made one for an auction to raise money for our youth at church...it sold for $80. I do put 8 cups of confectioners sugar in the icing when I make it. Also, if you dip the stem end of the strawberries in melted chocolate and let them cool on wax paper, they don't leak on the icing when you make this cake in advance. This one is really worth the effort. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This cake was so easy to make and an absolute hit of the party!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I have made this cake several times and it gets raves galore. Was told by an elderly gent' that it was by far the best chocalate cake ever. I have to agree, it is moist and no-one would ever guess it begins with a cake mix. There is never any left overs. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#lillith129Can anyone tell me how to make the decorative curly chocolate? Those are super easy!  Take some chocolate candy making wafers and place them in a zip lock bag, place the bag in a cup of water for a minute or so - just long enough to melt the chocolate.  Snip a tiny corner off the bottom of the bag and make some decorative swirls on a wax paper covered baking sheet.  Pop the sheet in the freezer for a few minutes and they'll set right up nicely.  You can peel them off and place them where ever you want them! I've done letters and put them on dishes of pudding topped with whipped cream for a fancy (and EASY) treat! Give it a try! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#awesome cake! Can anyone tell me how to make the decorative curly chocolate?
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#The look of the cake will impress. It was too much chocolate for my taste. I will make the ganache to dip in strawberries and I will make the garnishes again.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Pure yumminess
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Amazing taste, and does not taste like a box cake, I have made it several times. I just leave out the decorative swirls they just melt every time I try to make them.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I used all the ingrediants and followed the recipe exactly except that I coundn't find my cake carrier so at the last minute I made them into cupcakes. They were perfect!! It made exactly 24 cupcakes that I baked at the same temp as the recipe and 18 minutes of baking was just right. I had so many people tell me that it was the best cupcake they ever had! I took me all day to make them since I have little ones at home but it was so worth it! If you try this recipe you will not be disappointed. I can't wait to make them for Christmas Eve. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#The cake was tasty - did not taste like a box mix. The frosting was soft, easy to spread. Would need chilling on a summer day!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#tasty..
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Good..
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#love this recipe!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I made this cake for my sons high school graduation party. It was awesome! Everyone loved it. So fun to make. It was ALMOST too pretty to eat! Can't wait to make again. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#There really is no other choc cake recipe tha compairs. I leave off the strawberries and add just a sprinkle of sea salt in the middle and on the top. YUM!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Try using coffee instead of the water, OMGOSH GOOD!!!!!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This frosting has a POUND of butter in it. But you know what? This frosting is AMAZING. The ganache just puts it over the top. But the frosting... my oh my. Use it on your own choc cake recipe if you aren't sure about the cake part. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I love this cake. Any time I need a chocolate cake this is the one I make. I dont always use the same frosting or toppings though.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Best chocolate cake ever!!!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I made it for a birthday and everyone went crazy for it. I will be making this again and again!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#i made this for mother's day and a baby shower yummm best chocolate i have even made kids loved it 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I love the idea of this cake and it is really beautiful. I generally don't like using boxed cake mixes, though, so when I've made this again I use a from-scratch recipe. I also use my own chocolate buttercream recipe, this one always seems a bit grainy to me. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Got lots of compliments on this cake. Like eating chocolate covered strawberries. Best to let the frosted cake set up/chill in the refrigerator before adding strawberries and ganache and then keep refrigerated until ready to serve. The chocolate garnish are fun and easy to make and are a nice touch to an already beautiful and tasty cake.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I made this cake for my sons birthday and it was so fun and delicious! Very moist and yummy. He said it was the best cake he had ever had.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Everyone loved this cake! Turned out beautiful, although next time I make it I will make half of the ganache recipe, as it turned out to be alot!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This cake is worth the time and effort!! My husband said it was the best looking and best tasting cake I've ever made! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#1#0#I make this cake for a United Way auction and it went for over $700. They would like me to make another one.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I made this for my husbands birthday, and had several people over. Everyone loved this cake and there was no leftovers!!! My husband has already requested this every year in advance for his birthday cake. The ganache was easy to make and so was the decorative garnishes which I actually spelled out his name. I was worried because I only had a chocolate fudge cake mix, but it turned out fine. The cake was very moist and the icing was nice and smooth. I will definitely be making this again.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This cake was fabulous. I had a difficult time eating too much of it knowing how much butter was in the frosting (4 sticks!) I think next time I will use my own chocolate buttercream frosting recipe that calls for 1/3 cup of butter instead. The texture of the cake itself was superb. The ganache and the chocolate garnish on top were very easy to make. I loved the overall taste and appearance of the cake and will definitely make it again (but with a less buttery frosting!)
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I made this for two Christmas parties last year, and it was a hit with everyone! I made the chocolate garnishes into musical notes! Very impressive when put together, and not difficult at all to make! A chocolate lovers dream!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Perfect texture! Love the chocolate frosting! I went with a strawberry filling in the middle instead! came out beautiful!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This is THE best chocolate cake I've ever tasted. It has had many compliments. And to think that I made it!! :) 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I have made this twice. It is so delicious and moist! Everyone loves it.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I thought this cake would be hard to make, but it turned out beautifully. It tasted fantastic and I got tons of compliments. This is a great cake for entertaining and turns out just as pretty as the picture
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Very Very good cake, will make again, next time... Raspberries! After reading some of the reviews. People were having trouble with the frosting. I creamed the butter and alternated the powdered sugar/cocoa and milk, turned out great. The ganache was a little runny, next time I will add 1/4 C whipping cream. I made this for a dinner party and everyone cleaned their plate. They like that it wasn't to sweet. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I made this cake for my sisters birthday and there were no left overs. It was very good. It took a while to decorate but it was very fun and easy to decorate so time actually went by really fast. I will definitely be making this again.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#delicious...so rich and heavy..my new go to cake for a grooms cake or tiered chocolate... the cake alone is heavy enough to hold up to stacking. This cake was very moist and delicious and I recieved many compliments. I would definitely make this again..icing needs either meringe powder or less milk for decorating purposes but if made as shown in the picture the recipe works great. I would definitely make this cake again, and again, and again
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Got many rave reviews on this cake. Wasn't so sure that it was going to be so great because I thought that the cake was dense and that their was too much butter in the frosting, but after it was all put together and chilled in the fridge, it was excellent. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#The cake was moist and delicious and it wasn't too much trouble to make. I would probably use my own ganache recipe for the top next time, as I like it better. But this is a fabulous recipe for a great chocolate cake! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Sooo beautiful. It was very rich, but my husband loved the richness.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This cake was wonderful. However, I recognized the error in the icing before I baked the cake. I used only one stick of butter as is normally required for four cups powdered sugar. I have made it several times and the icing is excellent. Four sticks of butter would make the icing run off the cakefour sticks of butter
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Took about 3 hours from start to finish to make this cake. I made it for a fundraiser bake sale... it looked amazing! Unfortunately, it only made $10 at the bake sale.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I tried this cake just to see if it was like other chocolate cakes... But it is much more! My family always calls me to make this special cake on all occasions! It is fun and decorative and is fun for all to enjoy! I even made cupcakes out of it for a birthday party and it was a huge it! Thank you to the lady who was runner up! It's #1 with my famil! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Made this for my grandmother's birthday. Got more compliments on this cake than anything I've ever made before! I don't like chocolate on chocolate cake typically, but this is my favorite cake now! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Very //excellent everyoneone loves it.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#i made this for our christmas dinner for work dec/2009/ it was awesome/ i made to of these cakes last christmas. i am planning to make it again in the next few weeks. sue
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I did a fundraiser at a missions trip youth auction to do a dessert a month for 6 months. I did this one as the first one to present that day so people could see what kind of goodies they would be getting. People thought it was fake, it was so pretty! It helped bring in $120 for the auction!!! This was well worth the time!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This cake is delicious! I've made it twice now, and I definitely prefer using a Devil's food cake mix over a milk chocolate mix. The chocolate flavor is more intense, which I prefer. I'm usually not a fan of buttercream frostings, but this one is pretty good, and I LOVE the ganache over the top. It really balances out the sweetness of the chocolate buttercream. I personally don't like really thick frosting on my cakes, and I felt there was too much buttercream. The second time I made this cake, I only made half, and it was the perfect amount of frosting, in my opinion. Very delicious cake! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This was a hit at our family Christmas party! I put more ganache on and Grandpa asked if I really made it or bought it! :)
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I made this in square 9x9 pans and bunched straberries to the center. It looked amazing and I was told by 3 baking women that is was the best chocolate cake they have ever had!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This cake was delicious. Had a lot of trouble with the frosting as would not set up with all that butter. Kept it in the refrigerator to keep it intact. If I make it again, will certainly change the frosting recipe.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This cake is TO DIE FOR! Probably the best chocolate cake I've ever made. Absolutely delicious and pretty easy to make. Just don't look at the calories and fat! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I made this for my sister's birthday, and it was a very big hit. Would definitely recommend it. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I already reviewed this and not sure why it didn't post? I've made this cake 3 times to rave reviews. There seems to be some question about the amount of butter in the frosting. It is correct. The flavor is chocolatey and butter and the consistency is soft but oh so good! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#The best chocolate cake I have ever made. It was so impressive and so delicious. I don't ever want to lose this recipe! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Two teenage girls made this with little help! It was delicious and moist. Wonderful combination of ingredients. We will definitely make this again!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Just got done making this cake with my niece. Easy to follow. Only used 1 1/2 cups butter in the frosting. Really rich.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I've made this cake 4 times in a month. Its awesome, everyone loves it! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Absolutely fun and fantastic yummy. Did not follow frosting recipe, felt it was too much butter. Used a chocolate butter cream recipe that used 6 tablespoons. Just as good! Will definitely make this again.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Made for Christmas. Did not use strawberries, but decorated the top with holiday M&M's. I decreased the frosting a bit - used 1 less stick of butter and slightly less sugar, cocoa, and milk. It still turned out enough and delicious. One of the best chocolate cakes I've ever had! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I have made this cake a couple of times! It was really good. One thing I did leave out the second time was the 1/2 cup of milk in the frosting. The frosting, to me, did not need the milk. it was much easier to work with without it! But a great cake!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Ok so just made this cake, have not tried it yet, but tried the frosting and I think it is way buttery, next time I make it I might just use store bought or find a differnt frosting.It is very easy to make!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#ok, so this may sound like a dumb question, but I'm making this now, and as I'm mixing it, it is extremely thick.. do I add the water and oil called for on the box of the cake mix PLUS whats in the receipe here, or just what is called for in the receipe listed here?? Or is the thickness normal?? Didn't see anyone else comment about it so...??? 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This was so simple and easy! I am making it for a bridal shower as the bride requested chocolate and strawberries! How perfect! I made a practice cake before the shower, and it was so easy! Except I used a choc marshmallow fondant over the icing because my icing is never perfect! It was delicious!! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This cake, while very fancy looking, was extrmely easy to make. It was rich and delicious. I made it to take to a friend's house when we went for dinner and everyone LOVED this cake, even those of us who are not normally thrilled with chocolate cake. My only suggestion: DO NOT read the nutrition facts... just enjoy the cake! I definitely will make this elegant cake again! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#My sister made this cake for Christmas Eve dinner. We all loved it! I will definitely make it for myself in the very near future!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Oh my goodness would I make this again? Absolutely! I made it for a family gathering over Christmas and everyone loved it. I'm making it tonight for a co-worker's birthday tomorrow. One little tip - wrap your cakes in saran wrap, then reynolds wrap and freeze until firm. This really helps in making the cake easy to trip and frost. Such a beautiful and scrumptious case! I don't mind the time involved whatsoever. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Won rave reviews! Will definately make again. I agree this is labor-intensive, especially because I doubled it the first time I made it and was worried to'try it out' Christmas day. I used 2 cake mixes in 9x13 in pans- was afraid it wouldn't be enough for everyone. I had to increase the baking time, of course. Kept checking for doneness- ended up 40+ minutes at same temp. Didn't need 2x frosting and really not 2x ganache - but I used all of it! I cut the strawberries in half to cover larger cake surface. I used choc chips for the semi-sweet chocolate and melted in microwave-that worked great. Next time I will use a plastic bag with hole snipped in corner to pipe the decorative designs. Never got runny enough to drizzle from a spoon and was a mess to get out of my cake decorator once it hardened. Transported the decorations in a shirt box wrapped in waxed paper and inserted just before we ate dessert. Swore I would not make again if it was only as good as the box mix, but everyone raved. I guess it will become a tradition! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This is the BEST chocolate cake I have ever made! It is moist for days after it's made. This will now be the cake I will always make when choclate cake is requested! Excellent! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This cake got rave reviews at Christmas! Very light and airy, not overly sweet or rich at all. The frosting was just delicious!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#made it for my daughters birthday.Could not justify 1lb of butter in the frosting so used 2 sticks and it turned out great.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#This was the best cake I'd ever made.So delicios 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Made this for Christmas day and everyone loved it. Definitely a cake that gets noticed. Thinking of making a 4th of July version and make white frosting and white choc swirl sticks and then have blueberries and strawberries. Such a great recipe!!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Love this cake! I used raspberries and blackberries instead of strawberries. It was great!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#How do you do the ganache? The picture has it on before the strawberries but the recipe says to drizzle ON top...help?!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#The cake turned out well, but I think 2 cups of butter is too much butter--I now have chocolate soup chilling so I can ice this cake--thinking about only making the ganache instead.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I made my own chocolate frosting which was similar to this one and we LOVED it this cake was easy and a total show stopper. Next time though I am using raspberries rather than strawberries as we prefer those!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#A show-stopper! A bit labor-intensive, but so worth it. The frosting is amazing. Would make this anytime for a special occasion!
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Fantastic cake recipe and very easy. Super moist! My family isn't crazy about the butter icing, so I switch to a cool whip and chocolate pudding icing. The combination of chocolate and strawberries was delicious and it looked beautiful! I took this to our annual family Christmas gathering and it was a hit! 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#Lovely, lovely cake. I had a hard time finding nice strawberries...so I used a can of pie cherries instead. It looked beautiful with the chocolate accents and the cherries cascading down the sides as well as the ganache. A big hit at the office Christmas party. Thanks.
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I just made this for my husband's birthday via a request from him after he saw the magazine cover picture. It turned out very delicious. I would not place the strawberries on top next time although it makes for a beautiful cake. The strawberries go bad before we can eat the cake, I would serve it with strawberries on the side next time. I don't understand the others problems with the frosting, we loved it not to sweet and it wasn't too soft as others said.Being as it is December I had a hard time finding nice strawberries. My husband loved it. I would also leave off the ganache as it is just not needed the frosting is rich enough without it. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I made this for my neighbor for his birthday, he raved about it repeatedly, his wife said it was the very best chocolate cake she had ever eaten. I had to agree. In baking this cake I found that it took longer than the 28-32 minutes it called for to bake throughly. The frosting was soft but easily spread without running and it was delicious. I couldn't get the ganache to harden so I just dripped it over the strawberries and down the sides of the cake. It was superb and the cake I thought was going to be dried out from extra baking time but it was beautifully moist. A real surprise for excellency because it was formed from a cake mix. I will definitely bake this again. 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#I thought this was heaven! The frosting was alittle too soft so I just kept it chilled. YUM
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#It was a really good cake the only problem i had was with the frosting so if i make it again i wouldn't use this frosting....Other wise good cake 
Chocolate-Strawberry Celebration Cake#0#0#The cake looked so great we didn't want to cut in to it, it was easy to make and delicious!! 
Cherry Bars#0#0#These were yummy and easy to make. I love the almond-cherry flavor combination so liked that the almond extract was in the bars as well as the glaze. I also sprinkled some blanched almonds over the top of the bars after glazing, for extra flavor and texture and it looked really pretty too. These bars were a bit thinner than I prefer, so next time I will bake them in a smaller pan.
Cherry Bars#0#0#These were really good bars! I had a 1/2 can of strawberry pie filling to use up so I only made 1/4 of the bar recipe (but used 1/2 the glaze recipe to pipe on top and made it a really thick consistency, topping once they were completely cool). I made this in an 8x8 baking dish and it came out perfect, although I did allow it to bake for 50 minutes. Next time I'll try 1/2 the recipe in a 13x9. I think the key is to have a thin layer of bar on the bottom and increase the time a bit to assure it's done. I didn't use the almond extract, that seemed odd to me, but will try the almond slivers like others. I'll be making these for company in the future, I think they'd be wonderful on a brunch buffet! 
Cherry Bars#3#0#I've made these several times and everyone loves them, especially my picky husband! The only change I made was I sprinkled a handful of slivered almonds and a couple pinches of cinnamon over the top. I did bake 40 minutes and was perfectly light golden brown and done. Easy, tasty, and beautiful on the dinner table. Thank you! 
Cherry Bars#3#32#Every year for our family picnic my sister-n-law brings this pastry. It doesn't make any difference if there is 20 or 40 in attendance there's always at least 1/2 to 3/4 of the pastry left over. You would think that would be a hint that most don't care for it. This July is was a goopy mess. It had to be scooped out of the pan. It was certainly under baked. If you like the store bought Kuchens/Danish/Streusel that is baked in the foil tins, then you'll probably like this because in my opinion that's exactly what it tastes like. 
Cherry Bars#4#0#Loved this recipe! My husband's favorite. But why no print icons to use anymore? 
Cherry Bars#7#2#I had this recipe and lost it. Thanks for sharing. I never had a problem with mine being done. I nevr take anything out of the oven without checking To see that it is done. As far as the glaze being thin all you have to do is add more powdered sugar if that happens. Two things with this recipe, use the correct size pan and don't omit the almond extract.
Cherry Bars#7#3#The recipe says it makes 5 dozen bars. How does a 15x10 pan make 5 dozen bars???
Cherry Bars#9#2#I baked half a recipe in a 11 x 7 glass baking pan for 40 minutes . I haven't tried it yet as its still cooling but its golden brown on the top and bottom. Thanks so much for sharing an easy recipe. They look delicious! 
Cherry Bars#20#5#I wonder if a lemon glaze would be good?
Cherry Bars#3#1#I am asked to make these all the time...they are simple to make, not very many ingredients, and everyone seems to like them. The only problem I have is that the glaze seems to run...any suggestions (an no, I am not using too much milk).
Cherry Bars#11#3#Whoever did the cooking in this video has the most beautiful hands.
Cherry Bars#7#28#I followed the instructions exactly, and baked for even longer than the recipe said (the video says 30-35, the written recipe says 35-40-I did 40). It was brown on top. I took it out, cooled it, put on the glaze and cut it. It was still raw. I'm baking it again but it is probably ruined since it already glazed. Haven't even gotten to taste it. :-( 
Cherry Bars#21#8#I cut the ingredients in half and baked in a 7x11 baking dish. I also used a cookie scoop to put the remaining dough on top. It's more cake like and the top looks like individual biscuits with cherry filling. Tastes delicious! I used a combo of heavy whipping cream/water in the glaze since I was out of milk. Wondering if this needs to be refrigerated since the glaze has cream in it?
Cherry Bars#2#1#I love when you don't have a slew of ingredients to make a great dessert as tasty as this. The eggs gave this the rise it needed and the cherries and almond glaze topped it off perfectly. Great recipe that is definitely a keeper!
Cherry Bars#7#2#Cherries and almond is a perfect combo!
Cherry Bars#8#21#This crust has no baking powder or baking soda and it results in being very flat. There are better recipes than this one.
Cherry Bars#3#0#This has become a family favorite! It is easy to make and everyone loves it!
Cherry Bars#6#0#I've made this recipe in a smaller size, 9 x13 inch pan for over 30 years. Easy to make and always a hit! Never fails and is easy to make. It's an old standby recipe.
Cherry Bars#3#0#I cut this recipe in half as I only had one can of pie filling. Used 9x9 pan. Took roughly 45 minutes to bake but turned out like a cherry danish. Really good! I'll make it again. 
Cherry Bars#2#0#With a few left over pantry items during Covid-19 quarantine, this was a hit!! I didn't have almond extract so used a bit more vanilla extract. Crust was amazing good. Cherry pie filling was ok but would have added some fresh cherries to really make it pop.
Cherry Bars#2#0#I have made these bars several times. Very good and easy to make.
Cherry Bars#5#0#This recipe is delightfully easy to make and really impressive in the sheet pan. I would drizzle either the confectionary sugar glaze or chocolate ganache to really up the flavor of cherry and chocolate. I would try any pie flavor filling for your own taste preference. The buttery crust and crumb-like topping is delicious.
Cherry Bars#4#0#I made this Cherry Bar recipe after the holidays and then wished I had made it for the holidays! It is wonderful. My family loved it and wanted the recipe. Next time, I'm trying with either peach or apple! 
Cherry Bars#3#2#This is a recipe my grandmother and then mother used to make. I make it for work potlucks because it's easy, needs few special ingredients (not usually on hand), so can be made in a pinch. I believe this recipe was in a magazine or newspaper where my grandmother would've gotten it.
Cherry Bars#2#0#Very easy! Could substitute any pie filling.
Cherry Bars#1#0#Tried it for Sunday dinner, easy and delicious. Was a big hit
Cherry Bars#3#1#I've made these colorful and delicious Cherry Bars many times over the years since first seeing the recipe in Taste of Home. Always a popular treat and super easy to make!
Cherry Bars#7#0#Easier than cherry pie-! I really enjoy these. They freeze well. Sometime I glaze them after I have defrosted. I have also made in a 9x13 pan and baked about 15 min longer
Cherry Bars#20#2#Part 2... If you bake them a bit longer than recommended the crust holds up better in bar form. I often bake them 45-50 mins at home. Never had a burnt crust. The convection ovens at the bakery were definitely faster. If they come out with softer crust just cut into smaller 2-bite size pieces or eat with fork. The batter is very thick. Fist time I made I I though I did something wrong. You can easily alter the amount of sugar to your liking. Change up the filings, extracts and nuts or other add-in's as you choose. It's pretty forgiving. It's kinda bad hard to mess up this recipe. Under-baking is usually the biggest issue, as is not using enough filling. At a bakery you can't skimp on fillings. Customers don't like that :-). If you do add the drizzle on top it will make the bars a bit wet it the sit out all day. Bakery tip: For dryer drizzle use less milk. It should be very thick - as in not a drizzle at all but kinda toothpaste like. Then heat in microwave, no more than 10 seconds at a time. Gets super hot very fast. Once hot, drizzle quickly, as it will harden/get crusty very quickly. Once it drys on the bars it won't make them overly soft. Works great and you can remix remaining crusted drizzle (with few drops of liquid) and reheat if it gets too difficult to work with. I burned myself a few times with the hot mix so be careful not to overheat it
Cherry Bars#6#2#I make these bars quite often for potlucks and when asked to bring a dessert. Almost everyone loves them...especially the cherry lovers. Easy to make, very few ingredients, easy to take almost anywhere. I always am asked for the recipe at least once every time I bring them. I did not change the recipe from the original, it's great just as it was written! 
Cherry Bars#2#0#Everybody's new favorite! I love that you can easily make just a half batch in a 9 x 13 pan. Yum!
Cherry Bars#0#0#These bars are delicious! I have made them many times to take to a picnic, etc. and am always asked for the recipe. Easy and tasty!
Cherry Bars#3#0#This recipe turned out very well. I used one can of cherry pie filling and one jar of preserved sour cherries because that's what I had on hand. I will definitely make this again. 
Cherry Bars#5#0#This recipe was very easy. I made no changes, and had no difficulty getting the crust to cook completely. I did not have to bake the crust separately, as one reviewer suggested. I used this recipe to make for my customers. The bar was absolutely delicious. The crust was moist, yet sturdy to hold the cherry filling. Will definitely make again.
Cherry Bars#0#3#cut back to 1 1/2 butter, and 1 can cherries......great!
Cherry Bars#4#1#Before making these recipes I always read the reviews. Since this had good ones and I love cherry desserts I made them. They seemed baked through and browning on the top but as they sat they just kept getting softer and softer. They taste good but you have to use a spatula to serve them.
Cherry Bars#0#3#I made this for the first time, yesterday, July 29, 2018. I DID NOT make the glaze, as others recommended. This is delicious! I will definitely make this again and again. :)
Cherry Bars#0#0#This was a great recipe! Everyone loved them and pretty easy to make. Loved it!
Cherry Bars#1#2#edemars-2.5 x 16 x 2.5 = 15 10 x 1 = 10 
Cherry Bars#0#13#Ok recepe but too much sugar and cholesterol and fat
Cherry Bars#0#0#I made these for work to celebrate birthdays and work anniversaries. They were a big hit!!
Cherry Bars#1#0#I am sorry, am I reading this correct!? The recipes makes 5 dozen?? This doesn't sound right for a 15x10 pan?
Cherry Bars#3#0#I first made Cherry Bars when they were published in Taste of Home in 2001, but after 5 moves, misplaced the recipe. So glad to find it here! This is quick, easy, absolutely delicious, keeps well and travels well. As some other have noted, the glaze is quite sweet and about half what the recipe calls for is enough for me. A real keeper!
Cherry Bars#0#0#I have made these for 40 years but my recipe doesnt have a glaze and is plenty sweet. They are great for picnics.
Cherry Bars#1#0#I brought this dessert to a family gathering and I rec'd compliments on it from everyone!! 
Cherry Bars#3#0#These are really good. I would have given 5 stars but mine really didn't set up to make it easy to cut into bars, we had to eat them with a fork.gina.kapfhamer Moststandard cookie sheets are 10/15. I can't imagine being able to cut these to make 60 servings .I will try these again maybe using peaches. 
Cherry Bars#1#1#When you really want a pie, but want to make it in bulk, these bars are the answer! This is now top of my potluck recipe list. I didn't have a 10x15 pan, so instead used two 8x12 cake pans and just split up the recipe between the two - so my bars probably weren't quite as thick, but were still delicious. This was SO easy to make, and it's flexible too - you can use blueberry or some other pie filling for a different flavor. Also, this keeps well. It doesn't need to be refrigerated and can sit out without getting weird - making it perfect for any party (or to have on the counter at work to go with the daily coffee break). 
Cherry Bars#0#0#Very good, but too sweet. Next time I'll omit the icing. 
Cherry Bars#4#0#This is a fantastic dessert to feed a crowd. I was a bit skeptical of how thick my batter was to spread on the bottom of my pan, but it all baked up just fine! These cut best for me after chilling slightly. Delicious!
Cherry Bars#0#0#Sounds wonderful!!
Cherry Bars#0#0#My husband and I loved this recipe. I will reduce the sugar by 1/2 and continue to use the icing next time.I halved the recipe and used 9x9 baking pan and cooked 40 min. Delicious!!
Cherry Bars#0#0#Here's a little trick I use to make my glaze sugar free. I take sugar free vanilla frosting and put it in the microwave for 20-30 seconds (make sure the foil top is removed), just long enough to be pourable as a glaze. I don't use much, just enough for squiggles on top. Flavorings like almond extract can also be added by the teaspoon after microwaving. 
Cherry Bars#0#0#These cherry bars are sooo moist, but not too sweet! We love these. The possibilities are endless with canned pie filling and extracts used to complement the fruit! Yummy!!
Cherry Bars#3#0#Perfect for our Canada 150 celebrations this up coming weekend! Cooking for 50 and this is one of the desserts I chose to make~ Perfect & festive.
Cherry Bars#1#0#So delicious!!! Reminds me of a pastry we use to make at the Bakery I worked at in during high school.
Cherry Bars#0#0#I have made this many times, and it is my brother-in-law's favorite dessert. People love it! I have also used peach pie filling. 
Cherry Bars#1#0#Very good, easy, will make again! I also used only one can of cherries & extra almond extract& cooked 5 minutes longer. Pays to look at reviews! I loved the cherries and will try peaches too.
Cherry Bars#1#0#DELICIOUS. Is kind of like a cherry pie with a sugar cookie crust. Didn't have the right sized pan, (I need another piece of bakeware like I need a hole in the head!) so I used a 10x13. Because of smaller pan, the dessert was too thick and juicy to cut into bars even though I cooked it quite a bit longer. Will continue to tinker until it works in a 10x13. It really doesn't matter about pan size because it's going to be fantastic no matter what. 
Cherry Bars#0#0#I made 1/2 the recipe exactly and put on smaller cookie sheet it was delicious,and simple to make,try with a scoop of vanilla icecream,yummy.will definitely make again.
Cherry Bars#1#0#Made these today using Stevia baking blend and egg substitute. Made a half-recipe.Baked for 30 minutes, but probably should/could have left them in for another 5. Will do that next time.Did not make the frosting drizzle, and don't need to -- these have a really nice flavor. We wouldn't want it to be too sweet. 
Cherry Bars#0#0#We liked this recipe. I made as is.
Cherry Bars#0#0#A total hit with my family! I adapted it for fewer servings using an 8 x 8 pan and omitted all the almond extract because I'm not a fan. I added sliced almonds on top of the pie filling instead. Mine took the full bake time. Definitely making this again. 
Cherry Bars#3#0#The taste was good, but I had trouble getting them completely cooked. I baked for 45 minutes until the top was golden brown. When I went to cut them, the lower crust was not cooked the whole way through. I had to put them back in the oven for 10-15 minutes more. Next time I will try baking the bottom crust for maybe 15 minutes before putting the cherries on, similar to how lemon squares are baked.
Cherry Bars#1#5#Really bland. Looked super delicious in the pic. I would say skip the almond extract and use cinnamon in its place. And instead of the mixture on top us a cobbler/cake crumble instead. I think that would do the trick. Nobody in my family of 6 liked it. And I'm the only one that is picky. So that's pretty bad. 
Cherry Bars#2#2#Would give this 5 stars had I not altered the recipe based on some of the reviews I read. I cut the amount of sugar in half (which didn't seem to make a difference) and only used 1 can of pie filling. It seemed like enough (I used raspberry), but after baking I regretted that decision. Will definitely make again and use the full 2 cans. Other than that, these were a hit at the Wisconsin Badger football party I took them to. 
Cherry Bars#1#0#I loved these and adjusted nothing, except adding some minutes to the bake time. They remind me of something my grandma used to make but better with the glaze and almond flavoring. They were a big hit at the family gathering, too.
Cherry Bars#2#0#Very good. Will make again. I added 1/2 tsp almond extract, instead of the 1/4th. I also had to increase the baking time to 40-45 mins. I used powdered sugar, instead of the icing.
Cherry Bars#1#1#With a few minor differences this has been a favorite recipe in my home and community for a good many years. We use only 1 can of cherry filling--I cannot imagine how wet it would be with 2 cans. Try using an apricot pie filling for another very special treat. Haven't made them for quite some time but we all cut them to be a generous size so the yield is not 60 out of a jelly roll size pan.farmerjoy 
Cherry Bars#1#0#Made these today as a valentine surprise for home!! They are so easy...excellent flavor..everyone loves them!! Made exactly as written. Will try again with blueberry pie filling, and raspberry. Bet they would be great with Lemon Curd, too!!
Cherry Bars#0#0#We love these bars at my house! I have made them several times and have even taken some to school for a bake sale.
Cherry Bars#0#0#Super easy to make. Like others recommended, I used only one can of pie filling, flipped the proportions of vanilla and almond extracts and sprinkled a handful of chocolate chips. Could also do without the drizzle, or at least reduce it by half. Hubby thought the bottom cookie was too thick, but I liked it. Next time, I'll reduce the dough on the bottom and add it to the top. I also baked it for 35 minutes and then turned the oven off and let it sit in there for another 5 min with the door cracked. It was perfectly done. 60 portions seems optimistic, but even small, bite-sized squares hold up nicely as a finger food dessert. 
Cherry Bars#1#0#Two BIG thumbs up from our family of four. Easy, simple and delicious recipe. We halved and made in a 13x9 casserole dish. Cooled and drizzled the glaze, looks and tastes as good as it came from a bakery. Yes, i did bake an extra few minutes to obtain the golden color. Loved the almond extract flavor. Will be making again soon, I am sure, and would like to experiment with different fruit filling for variation. YUM! PS- Just made a pan using peach filling, still amazing!! This is a fabulous recipe. :)
Cherry Bars#0#0#Great
Cherry Bars#1#0#Very good and easy to make. I also reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup , added 1/2 tsp baking powder, and omitted the almond extract. I have made these cherry bars in the past with powdered sugar sprinkled on top, but the hint of glaze was even better!
Cherry Bars#0#0#Kind of gooey, but really good and super easy to make. My family loves'em. I cut the recipe in 1/2. The full recipe makes a'ginormous' amount. But, almost all of ours from the 1/2-recipe are eaten already. Also, made mine with only vanilla extract, as I'm allergic to the almond. Still came out very good. 
Cherry Bars#0#0#These were easy to make and very good. I did add slivered almonds to the top and that made it even better!!!
Cherry Bars#0#0#Great! Feeds a crowd! Wonderful flavor with hint of almond.
Cherry Bars#1#0#I tried them for the first time for Easter. They went over very well and were easy to make. I used 1 can pie filling mixed with frozen cherries picked last year to make up the difference for second can. No extra sugar was needed and turned out great. I did add 1/2 tsp. baking powder to dough. Will be making again!
Cherry Bars#1#0#my Mom made these and we called them Valentine Squares. very good !!
Cherry Bars#1#0#These bars are sooo good!!!! The only changes, 1/2 cup less sugar and added 1tsp baking powder. Excellent recipe.
Cherry Bars#0#0#Better than I expected.. they were great! I used Raspberry filling since that was what I had on hand!
Cherry Bars#2#0#these are great to you people who dont bake well dont comment unles you make them. why would you comment about them not sweet enough with 2cups of sugar. then another cupof sugar in the glaze.dont bring down the rating on a winning recipe. ikeep seeing the same people with down grading great recipes. very intrested in the blackberry filling. this recipe can be used with many different fillings.
Cherry Bars#0#0#Really good, I will definitely make these again BUT will 1/2 cup less sugar.
Cherry Bars#0#0#These bars are exceptional! Soooo delicious! I made these bars and took them to church. I had so many people come up to me and tell me just how yummy they are. I made these exactly as the recipe states, except I used blackberry pie filling instead of the cherry. Thank you!
Cherry Bars#1#0#I have used this recipe for over 20 years. My family loves it. I even make it in 3 round cake pans, and take it to bake sales, and they are gone in minutes for a good price. I also change up the pie filling. Mine doesn't call for the glaze. It has you sift powdered sugar over the top after it is cool. We love it as coffee cake in the morning too. My grandchldren can't get enough of it. 
Cherry Bars#0#0#I have made these many times and they always go! They're just right, not too sweet and easy to make. 
Cherry Bars#0#0#I have tried this recipe, and have found it to be a very good one, it was very delicious, and I would use it again.....
Cherry Bars#0#0#Mixed emotions about these. The crust and toping is lacking something. I think maybe a sweeter crumb topping might be better.
Cherry Bars#0#1#They are ok. Not to-die-for . Easy enough that I may make again, but other desserts outshine these in taste...a little heavy on the almond extract. Turn out well if prepared exactly as directions say, but need to bake longer in the oven. 
Cherry Bars#0#0#Great dessert. I used only 1 can of pie filling and baked the bars for 30 minutes in a jelly roll pan and it was perfect. The flavor of the dough was like a sugar cookie. Will definitely be making this again.
Cherry Bars#0#5#Thought the Cheery bars looked good but was more interested in the nutritional value for them, I didn't make them as didn't know the point value for weight watchers for my family's needs. Hopefully soon that infor will be available and I can make these for my family. 
Cherry Bars#1#1#I had to bake at least 45 to 50 minutes to get some browning on the top, this DID NOT overbake them on the bottom. If I make again I will omit the almond flavoring in the icing.I took them to work and the reviews were that they were great !
Cherry Bars#0#0#Loved these! Really easy to make. I was concerned when I started them that it was going to be too thin on the pan but they turned out great.
Cherry Bars#1#0#Cut sugar to 1 cup and sub with 1 cup of finely chopped pecans.
Cherry Bars#0#0#These were not bad, but were dense with no leavening and just didn't seem quite right. Might be worth trying to add some baking powder because the flavor was pretty good apart from it had a slight eggy flavor. 
Cherry Bars#0#0#These are wonderful, I made them for our Thurs. night Bible Study and everyone loved them and asked for the recipe. I have to say this is the best recipe I have gotten in a long time.
Cherry Bars#0#0#These are delicious! I sprinkled with powdered sugar instead of making the icing - wonderful! Big hit on Valentine's Day.. 
Cherry Bars#0#0#Made according to recipe and they were great! Very sweet, so you can cut them small and get the 60 servings. Had many compliments when I took them to a potluck.
Cherry Bars#0#1#Easy to make and sweet. I left off the icing and didn't miss it. Had to bake the bars longer, as many other reviewers suggested. Tasty, but quite plain, otherwise it would get 5 stars. 
Cherry Bars#0#0#Loved the flavor - only change I made was that I used cherries from a neighbors tree and made my own filling instead of purchased canned filling
Cherry Bars#0#0#Made these once for card club and once for our extended family Christmas (27 people). Overwhelming thumbs-up. The only change I made was I used three cans of Comstock extra cherries and baked for 45 minutes. Not only did it taste great but looked fantastic.
Cherry Bars#0#0#I love these bars, then again I love sweets. Two non favoring dessert family members actually had seconds. I used blueberry pie filling. It was stated that the bars tasted something like the Hostess Blueberry Pies.
Cherry Bars#1#2#It was simple and plain in my opinion. It tasted like a vanilla wafer cookie with cherry pie filling spread on it. It's so sweet you can eat it without the icing. Sorry to say I don't think I will be making this one again. I would give it one star but my son said it should be a least two stars due to the sweetness factor. 
Cherry Bars#0#0#very good --nothing but good reviews from everyone who eat these. did have to bake 20 minutes longer till golden brown. YUM YUM!
Cherry Bars#1#1#This recipe was very good, I think next time I make them I would use 1 large can of pie filling instead of 2 regular size cans.
Cherry Bars#0#0#I use this recipe often. I also bake a bit longer. I also substitute blueberry pie filling and add a crumb topping for a variation. This recipe is a great last minute dessert for company.
Cherry Bars#0#0#These are very good. I baked them 10 minutes longer than suggested. The bottom layer became a little soggy after sitting for a day.
Cherry Bars#0#0#I love cherry desserts, and I wanted this recipe to be as delicious and special as so many reviews said; however, it was so plain tasting.
Cherry Bars#0#0#These were Awesome, My family love them. I am making them this Holiday also.
Cherry Bars#0#1#I was attending a 25th Wedding Anniversary and was told the husband loved anything cherry so I thought I would give these a try. My new Taste of Home magazine had just arrived with this recipe featured so I decided to bake a new recipe. They were fabulous! If you like cherry, you will love these! The only change I made was to bake about 5 minutes longer than recommended and did a full teaspoon of almond extract. This recipe is a keeper!
Cherry Bars#0#0#Fantastic! I even sprinkled chocolate chips on about 1/4 of the cherry topping, and I think that was even better than the plain cherry part.
Cherry Bars#0#0#This is an absolutely wonderful recipe in all respects. it's easy, delicious and has ingredients which I usually have on-hand in my pantry. I served it to a small breakfast event I catered and it was a hit with everyone. I usuall don't care for cherry things, myself, but this is delicious. I look forward to trying it with blueberry pie filling, too! 
Cherry Bars#0#0#I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9 x l3 pan. I kept the flavorings the same. It turned out great. it's a keeper!!!!! 
Cherry Bars#0#0#I made these bars a few days ago and they were a hit. I made two batches, one with the cherry pie filling and another one with blueberry. Both turned out beautifully.
Cherry Bars#1#0#This should come with an exercise plan as I made this last night and I thought it turned out real good - so much so that I've eaten more than my fair share. Anyway, it is sweet (and I love sweets). Next time I will cut the sugar though - maybe 1 1/2 cups not 2. Also the cooking time is closer to 40-45 minutes. I will try this again with peaches. YUM! 
Cherry Bars#0#0#This was really tasty. I took it to a cookout, and everyone liked it. Several people even said they don't like cherries, but liked this. It did come out more like a cobbler than a bar, though. 
Cherry Bars#0#0#Have made this for church brunch potluck, and there is never any leftover. Tried cherry and apple, but think I'll do peach next time. Also made for fellow winter Texans potluck and it's a big hit. 
Cherry Bars#1#0#This recipe was delicious! I will make this again but will definitely increase the baking time. I baked for approximately 40-45 minutes and the bars in the center of pan were gooey and underbaked. I made them for a potluck and I could not serve the bars in the center, they were a gooey mess.
Cherry Bars#1#0#My family likes this recipe. Thanks for putting it online. I add 1 tsp baking powder to the batter. I use 1 tsp of almond extract instead of 1/4. Because it is one of my go to recipes, I only use one can of cherries. If I were going to bring it a get together, I would use 2 cans. 
Cherry Bars#0#0#Made this one yesterday, It was a big hit at work and at home.
Cherry Bars#0#0#This is my go to recipe when I need a good dessert for a potluck. Everyone loves it! I often times use other flavors of pie filling. I have made these with Peach and Blueberry as well as the cherry! :)
Cherry Bars#0#0#Made this for Christmas and nobody liked it! I thought it was okay, but nothing special enough to make again. This is not going in my recipe book needless to say.
Cherry Bars#0#0#My husband isn't wild about cherry pie filling but he's crazy for these bars. I am making these for the 2nd time in 3 days, they were THAT delicious! This makes a generous amount, perfect for sharing with a neighbor and still having some to enjoy. Thanks for this wonderful go to recipe, it's a keeper! 
Cherry Bars#0#0#This was so easy to make and it was DELICIOUS!! All the cherry loving people in my family loved it.
Cherry Bars#0#0#it was a very deliciooous recipe alot better than i thought it would be
Cherry Bars#0#0#I had this at a party I went to and it was wonderful. I came home and made it and it was just as good the second time!
Cherry Bars#0#0#I increased the almond extract to 1/2 tsp for the cake since I like the flavor. Glad I did.I didn't use the glaze. The cake is MORE than sweet enough without it. 
Cherry Bars#0#0#Terrific!!! Tasted delicious and served beautifully. I had alot of valentines after serving this.
Cherry Bars#0#0#SOOOO GOOD! An instant hit with the family!
Cherry Bars#0#0#I have made this numerous times and have received many compliments on the end result. I have never added the icing, though, and you won't miss it! 
Cherry Bars#0#0#WOW! These were amazingly tasty!! The almond flavor is subtle but appropriate. I halved the recipe and it is just enough for a small gathering of friends! Not just for Christmas either.
Cherry Bars#0#0#I have made these numerous times and are always a hit! I make them for our Christmas gathering. Pretty for Christmas. Easy and yummy! The recipe makes a big batch so it's great for our large family gatherings. 
Cherry Bars#1#0#Made this easy dessert for Easter dinner...everyone commented on how yummy it was. It would be a perfect addition to a brunch buffet, also.
Cherry Bars#0#0#This is a wonderful recipe. I've made it for several years and it's a favorite. For a little variety, I often use 1 can of cherry and one can of blueberry. 
Cherry Bars#0#0#This is a delicious recipe! It's kind of a cobbler/Danish hybrid and turns out great with other fruit fillings as well. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#3#0#My kids love macaroni and cheese with Velveeta, and they like this one. It's easy to make and a great side dish. I would've liked a little crunch on top, or something to contrast the creaminess.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#1#A very nice recipe for Mac & cheese. It was a little milder than l really like. I added 4 slices of chopped bacon and some symbol. I'm sure the leftovers will be wonderful. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#3#1#I found this recipe several years ago on TOH. Made it for my grandson's high school graduation party. Everyone said it was the best they have ever had. We have it for every family gathering, but we now make a double batch. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#14#7#I've made this exactly as written (added corn flakes/butter for crunch on top) and the 2nd time I added 4 oz of cream cheese. Both times it was very tasty. The 2nd time I put it in 2 8x8 pans and put Panko on the top. I think that made it even better. Our friends had it the 2nd time and they said it was so good and they wanted the recipe. My butter, flour and mixture was thick before boiling, so I didn't boil it either time.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#14#0#I made this exactly as written. Excellent! Very creamy. I try a new mac and cheese recipe each week and I think that this is my favorite so far!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#3#6#I have been looking for a mac and cheese recipe my grandson and I both like. We scored with this one! I did not have Velveeta on hand, so I increased the sharp cheddar to 1-1/2 cups. I baked it in my Ninja Grill on the bake function @ 325 degrees for 20 minutes. Next time I will add the cheddar cheese to the cream sauce as suggested by other reviewers.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#10#7#I've made this one. I prefer to mix the cheddar with the sauce and melt it that way. As others have said, adding extra milk isn't a bad idea. Also, I divide this recipe in half because I'm only cooking for two people. I stumbled across another recipe which is very similar to this one. It is seasoned with 1/4 teaspoon onion powder and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder. My husband likes it this way, because he does not care for bland food. Also, we use sharp cheddar, or, as we call it in Canada, old or even extra old cheddar. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#2#15#653 calories in 1 cup!?! wow
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#6#14#So, the 1-1/2 cups of milk was no where near enough. Good God I could have built a chimney. However, I was able to rescue this. I had used half-and-half instead of 2%, and ended up having to add an ADDITIONAL 2 cups of 1% milk. I doubled the spices as well. With some TLC, it came out irresistible. I cooked 24 ounces (two boxes) of the Prince Thick and Hearty elbows. For topping, I melted 2 T. butter and added 1/2 cup panko and tossed to mix. Sprinkled it on top then sprinkled an additional 1/2 cup of shredded sharp cheddar. Convection baked at 325 degrees for 9 minutes in my counter oven. All family gave it 4 1/2 stars! Some recipes I have call for a little nutmeg in the sauce and others have called for a little dijon mustard. Both are good.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#2#0#My family loved it! It was delicious and creamy! Finally a mac and cheese recipe that's a keeper! Thank you Cindy! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#1#Just ok. Was rich and not the flavor I was looking for. Maybe as someone suggested adding some hot sauce might of giving me the flavor I was looking for.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#3#0#Nice Mac and Cheese. I cut the recipe in half. Used small shell pasta.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#This was a very nice mac
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#1#1#I love this recipe. I dont add parmesan because I dont like it,I dont substitiute I just leave it out. I also add potato sticks to the top for baking...Goooooood crunch! pik Nik Stiks. :) If you want it thinner, use a milk with less fat.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#1#0#Best mac and cheese! Used mozzarella cheese and chedder cheese. Also put cheese on top and bread crumbs for added crunch. Thanks TOH!!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#2#0#This was best mac and cheese I have ever had. I modified slightly by using extra sharp cheddar , Gouda , Swiss , muenster and Colby.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#3#2#This was amazing! I chose different shredded cheeses mixed mild cheddar, colby and sharp cheddar. I added about 2 TBS evaporated milk and used 1 1/2 2% milk and it was very creamy. Like the recipe states, USE AS MUCH MILK AS NEEDED TO CREATE DESIRED RESULT I will definitely be making this one again! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#2#Sauce is very thick. Looking for something more creamy
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Fantastic! I left out the sour cream, added 8 oz Colby Jack, and 1 extra cup of milk.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I love this recipe! I've made this recipe several times and have gotten many compliments. I agree with other reviews in that the sauce is thick, but it's very delicious. This is definitely a keeper :D 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Really enjoyed added gouda cheese. Made this again today but for some reason it came out griddy. Dont know what i did wrong but it didnt do it before and i have made it many times. So i still give it a five.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#2#I should have read the reviews with this one. The sauce is too thick and so the end product isn't as creamy as I'd like. It was too dry. For the effort this took, it wasn't worth it. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Very good!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#1#0#Very good with a little tweaking. I added a 1/2 cup of half and half to the cheese sauce and that gave it just the right consistency. I gently stirred the cheddar into the finished sauce off heat until melted, instead of tossing it with the pasta, and that worked out fine. I found it was easier to mix the sauce and the pasta together in a large bowl before transferring to baking dish (11x13 pan worked fine). I also sprinkled a liberal helping of shredded cheddar cheese over the top prior to baking.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#2#5#I didn't use all the cheese sauce this made. Mine came out a lot thicker than I expected. I will make this again but cut way back on the flour needed for this roux. I almost threw it out, but added almost twice the milk and kept on. It was tasty, but I think it was because of the seasonings. This recipe needs tweaking. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#best mac n cheese I found yet. if you love cheese this ones for you! did have a lot of cheese sauce so I added more pasta
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#1#1#This is a quick and easy homemade Mac n cheese recipe. Not one I'd make for company, nothing really special, but perfect when I want a quick Mac n cheese fix!! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#nice creamy recipe. Makes a lot of sauce. I increased the amount of pasta.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#1#0#The very best mac and cheese recipe. Loved it.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#This is one of my favorite recipes. I noticed a lot of complaints at the sauce, so here's what I've found. You can really half the sauce to the same amount of pasta OR you can add in some extras like broccoli or ham etc. I sometimes like the extra sauce so I will make an extra cup of macaroni to the regular sauce. I was really wanting this macaroni last night but didn't have any Velveeta. I used Monterey Jack cheese instead and it still turned out yummy. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#2#Instead of using the Velveeta cube (I don't like the way Velveeta taste) I substituted it with Cambell's cheese soup and it turned out great! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Was sooo cheesy. Wonderful, no more instant box macaroni and cheese.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#1#1#I agree with a previous review too much flour.The dish is very tasty but I found the cheese sauce too heavy .Will make again but decrease the flour to make a thinner consistency.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#1#0#Hands down the BEST Mac&Cheese recipe!!! The entire family LOVED it!!! It is very creamy and smooth! Instead of Velveeta cheese I used Medium Cheddar and I doubled the amount of Parmesan cheese. I also used heavy cream instead of milk. You only need about 1 cup of heavy whipping cream.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Thumbs up because my mama taught me not to talk with my mouthful? NOM NOM NOM! Came out perfect, and I doubled the recipe. This recipe is a winner!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Great recipe. I like my mac and cheese creamy like this. I added some panko to to the top for a little crunch.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#3#My kids liked this, but my wife and I thought it was gross. Too rich and creamy for my liking. It was also too pastey. I tend to like my mac and cheese a little milkier than this and not nearly as thick. Sorry, but I won't be making it again. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Just made this tonight on Thanksgiving and wow the family and I really loved it this was my first time cooking Thanksgiving dinner thanks big home run with this Mac & cheese
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#My daughter in law LOVES mac and cheese. I've been trying different recipes and stopped with this one. It's creamy and rich. I cooked the pasta less than it called for and it was awesome. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#loved this mac and cheese - creamy and dreamy
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I use rice pasta elbows and gluten-free all purpose flour to make this for my gluten intolerant grandmonster but even those not on a restrictive diet can't seem to get enough of the creaminess/cheesiness! I make a double recipe and never bring any home. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#It was a bit mushy to me but good. I would cook the macaroni less than package directions in the future.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#excellent! tons of compliments!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Pleased everyone from kids to adults.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Made as written - excellent mac & cheese!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Next time I will use a little more macaroni. The cheese sauce was great but there was a little too much.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#1#0#I've been looking for a great macaroni n cheese recipe for very long. This one is the best yet. I added extra cheese and used fat free milk. Definitely making it again. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#1#0#I am tossing my old mac n' cheese recipe that everyone in my family craved and loved, and replacing it with this. THIS is the mac n' cheese I've been looking for. I used light sour cream and sharp cheddar. I served it as a side dish with tuna cakes and sliced tomatoes. Yummy! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I have searched for so long for a really good creamy mac & cheese. This is awesome! It is a bit of work and expense but oh so worth it all. With so many in my family who love mac & cheese, this is indeed a keeper.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#1#0#Absolutely wonderful. I didn't have dry mustard, so I substituted a gourmet mustard instead. I kept an eye an it, so that it didn't come out too dry. It was in the oven for about 25 minutes. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Made this as a side for Thanksgiving...they LOVED it!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#This recipe is fairly easy to make and tastes really good! I will be making it again.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I used this recipe for Thanksgiving this year. It turned out great! I got a lot of compliments and was asked for the recipe. I definitely will use this recipe again!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#This mac and cheese tastes as good as it looks in the picture! It's definitely a keeper! I followed the recipe as written, but did omit the cheddar cheese. It was plenty cheesy without it. I also added Panko bread crumbs to the top of the casserole when it came out the oven. Yum! This recipe was easy to split in half. I used a 2-quart baking dish and baked it for 25 minutes at 350 degrees for half the recipe. Excellent!! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Terrific!! Best macaroni and cheese ever!!!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I've tried over a hundred Mac and Cheese recipes and this one is the best I've ever had! Mac and Chs is my favorite dish ever, so this is the one...only thing I did different is used whole milk, a little extra for creaminess, and more cheese:) I'm a cheese lover so I added some extra:) Excellent!!! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I made this recipe today for the first time..I seldom stick strictly to any recipe but this one sounded so great I did not change a thing. (other than to double it) It is the best mac and cheese I have ever made. I am a Gma to 15 and believe me I have made alot of the stuff. Thank you for such a great recipe.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I love this recipe, also my family and friends.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#This is awesome! I make it exactly as written. It is so creamy and perfect and delicious.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I've tried many different Mac N Cheese recipes and by far this is my favorite. I have since then thrown out all other recipes and now replaced this as my go to for my family favorite. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#1#0#I have made this recipe several times and it turns out perfect every time! The last couple of times, I mixed up the ingredients according to the recipe and then dumped it all into a buttered crock pot. It turned out perfectly then, too! This is the all time best mac-n-cheese recipe. For the american process cheese, instead of Velveeta, I use Kraft Deluxe American slices or I buy sliced American cheese at the deli counter, then cut it into chunks. For the shredded cheddar, I buy block cheddar and shred it myself. I usually use either all sharp cheddar or half sharp and half medium/mild. The sharp cheddar is the one with all the cheesy flavor. (I live in Wisconsin. I know these things, lol.)
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#1#I have been making this recipe for 5 years since it was first published. It has become my trademark dish for family & potluck gatherings & everyone requests the recipe. Now my 21 yr. old daughter wants to make it for a company picnic where she is co-oping this summer. Best mac & cheese recipe ever!!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#1#I have eaten and prepared many mac n cheese dishes over the years and all were always missing something. This dish is packed with that perfect flavor. It has gotten raves each time I have prepared it for a crowd and at home, as well. Delicious!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#This is the kind of Mac & Cheese that everyone loves...good and CREAMY. Made it for a church function and EVERYONE wanted the recipe!!! Excellent!!!!!!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#This is the best recipe for Macaroni and Cheese I have ever used. No need to add or change this recipe, it is perfect the way it is. Thank you!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Best Mac and Cheese as I've been searching for a long time. Only used 4 Tablespoons of fluor, 8 oz of Colby and Sharp cheese mixture instead of Velveeta, 8 cups of noodles and topped with some cheese and bread crumbs. Added bacon grease to leftovers extra sauce as a dip with chips...yummy! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#1#I have had this recipe for a couple of years & needed a meatless casserole so made it. I should have read the reviews!!! It had way too much sauce. My husband liked it and that is the only reason I would ever make it again. If there is a next time, I'll use twice as much macaroni and bake it in a 9x13 baking dish.had way too much sauce 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I have made this dish to pass at Church carry-ins and most recently to my In-Laws for Thanksgiving dinner!!! Everyone who has tried this has loved it!! It is easy to make and the thick, creaminess can't be beat! I almost always have the ingredients for this on hand. This is hands down my family's favorite homemade mac n cheese! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#2#0#Let me start by saying, I NEVER review recipes that I try. This one, I had to. I found this recipe about 4 months ago and made it, not holding out much hope that my kids would like it..they never like homemade mac and cheese. The family devoured this casserole. Then I lost the recipe and couldnt find it until yesterday, they devoured it again! Some changes did have to be made.1. I used a whole box of bow ties and needed a little bit more, it was very saucy. I like it like that so it didnt bother me.2. Yes, the sauce does get a little too thick, i just slowly added chicken broth to get to a good consistency for us.3. GRATE your own cheese! It makes a world of difference in that grainy taste, plus its cheaper.I can finally stop looking for a mac and cheese recipe, this will be the only one i ever make again. Thanks for a great recipe!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#1#0#We always use sharp cheddar, it's probably our fave cheese! My hubby and daughter request this at least once a week!! (They don't get it that often but would love it if they did!) 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Best Mac and Cheese Ever!!! I only used about 2-3 tablespoons of flour. Makes alot of sauce. Very yummy!!!!!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#1#This wasn't bad, but I'd try other recipes before trying to tweak this one anymore. I followed suggestions to not have a pasty taste by decreasing the flour and increasing the milk, but it was still a bit too thick and pasty for my taste. I did increase the macaroni to almost double, so that made a difference, but there was an unbelievable amount of sauce. I'm sure if I'd have used 2 cups as stated, it still would have been pasty. So not terrible, but I'll try others. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#1#This is the best mac and cheese recipe ever. However, I do use an entire pound of macaroni (elbow or shells), it's still very cheesy, make in 13x9x2 pan. I use lower fat cheese to help reduce a few calories. You can substitute mayonnaise for the sour cream if you don't have any on hand. My tip for making this is to measure all the ingredients ahead of time and have them all laid out on the counter ready to go. Yummy! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Very good, I will make again. I backed off on the flour and add a little more milk. Broiled for 2 min after 30 minutes.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Finally my quest for the perfect Mac & Cheese recipe is over. This is exactly what I've been looking for !!! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I put this recipe in my favorites book and have made it several times already! The only change I make consistently is to omit the ground mustard and use 1 Tbsp dijon mustard in its place. This is one of my favorite comfort food recipes!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I have been looking for a good Mac and Cheese recipe for a long time and I think I found it. Everyone loved it.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#1#0#My family of five loved this recipe, only addition was some onion powder. I doubled the recipe and it was a good thing because half the pan was gone after one dinner!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I'm a BIG Mac-&-Cheese Fan and have been looking for a more creamy homemade bake! This was it... if you love a little bit of noodle with your cheese this is the recipe for you!!! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#1#0#This was ok. I thought the sauce was very thick as others have mentioned. If I make it again, I will try less flour or try to thin the sauce. I have other mac n cheese recipes from Taste of Home that my family likes better.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#1#0#Super rich & creamy. Very fullfilling dish. Used 1cp cheddar & 1cp swiss because that's what we had on hand & it was delicious. We will definetly be making this dish again 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I've tried numerous macaroni and cheese recipes and this one tops them all! I will never try another recipe again. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#My family loves this recipe! We've also added buttered crumbs for a different touch, but it's great as is! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#1#it was ultimately cheesey, that is a fact! it was very thick, i added a cup of pasta water to mine and it was still very thick. i however, do not bake my mac n cheese, i just do not prefer it that way and i left out the mustard, not a fan. but, it was very cheesey and flavor was tastey. just too cheesey for us...otherwise, it was a good recipe:0)
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#This recipe is delicious! We did make some changes: we didn't put in the mustard, we substituted extra sharp cheddar cheese for the velveeta, and we did different noodles. It was very creamy with a delicious flavor. Everyone loved it! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I made this on Thanksgiving for my family and EVERYONE loved it!!! Best mac n' cheese ever and the kids kept going back for seconds. Lol. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#hi, i tried this recipe last night and it was very good.....i added some good ham from the deli, and some smoked cheddar cheese as well. I think next time i'll put in a little less flour since i live in Colorado and we probably don't need quite as much here.....i will make again...the recipe is in my file!!! thank you for sharing it. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#For homemade mac'n' cheese, this is the best I've tried. Definitely not dry. I agree with the other posters who said the sauce was thick and pasty. There was also too much of it for the amount of pasta. Next time I'll use a whole 16 oz. package of macaroni (3-1/2 cups uncooked) and alter the flour and milk as suggested by others to get a thinner sauce. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#My favorite macaroni and cheese recipe!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#This is the first baked macaroni and cheese recipe I made and will be my last. This is SO good, my kids love it and ask me to make it all the time!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#little dry, added pasta water.Husband loves it.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#This is a great mac and cheese recipie. I love to add smoked ham to it. It is one of my favorite recipies now
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#1#My family didn't like this. I think the mustard counted against the flavor. They asked me not to make it again. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#oops!! I forgot to rate this. Five stars!!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I am a cook at a retirement home. Everyone loves my Mac & cheese. Old time recipe. I tried this one on my family & they loved it.We think this is the ultimate macaroni & cheese. The only one I will make for my family now. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!!!!!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Amazing dish which was easy to cook and tasted great the next day as left overs.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#1#0#Oh Yeah! This mac & cheese really rocks! I did follow another rater's advice in that I increased the milk to 1 3/4 cups and reduced the flour to 1/3 cup and it proved to be the perfect consistency. I admit this is NOT a low-cal or low-fat dish, but it's fun to splurge once in a while and this one is worth it! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I've made this recipe several times, and it just seems to get better every time I make it. Super easy recipe and very tasty. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#very good and creamy... I only used 1/4 cup of flour and upped the milk to 1 3/4 cup.... very good, crushed crackers on top.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#YUM! This was both easy and tasty. Butter + Cheese + more cheese= a really good dinner.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Finally a homemade mac n' cheese that's creamy and not dry. 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Yummy thanks! The family enjoyed this very much!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#the best I've ever had in my entire life. I left out a few tablespoons of flour due to what someone said about being too thick, & added a 1/2 cup more of milk. It was soooooooo amazing. Thank you so much! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#This is my new mac & cheese recipe! It does seem a little thick when you're making the sauce, but hang with it. When it comes out of the oven it's AMAZING! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#This was just the recipe I've been looking for... for a long time. I used New York Sharp Cheddar for my shredded cheddar. The sauce seemed  a bit thick, so before baking I added more milk to it.... bringing the total amount of milk to 2 and 1/2 cups. I needed to bake it for 45 minutes to get it golden brown and bubbly.  This recipe is a real keeper ! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#1#We LOVED this recipe, I added1 Tbl of Worchester (our old favorite mac & cheese recipe has it), shared with a neighbor who loved it too & wanted the recipe. It's a keeper!!Sheri K 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I used 2% milk & used all reduced fat cheeses & sour cream & this was great. Nice & creamy. Thick & rich. Great dish. Will definitely make again. Although I question it serving 6. Mine made a 9 by 13 baking dish & when used as a side would easily feed 8. Maybe 6 if it were the entree.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Can't wait to try this! I'm going to add bacon pieces to it :o) 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#Yum! Enough said!!!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#My daughter (she's 31) says this is the best mac and cheese she's ever tasted. She always asks that I bring it to family potlucks. JKos 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I added ground beef, sauteed onions and bacon bits. Taste great.
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#The only thing I changed in this recipe was that I sauteed some onion with the butter. My husband loves onion with his mac-n-cheese. Fabulous recipe!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#1#I thought this had good flavor but mine came out really thick and kind of gummy. Maybe less flour and more milk next time?
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#1#0#I sprinkle a can of cheddar flavored french fried onions over the top of this before putting it in the oven. My husband who claims to only like boxed macaroni and cheese loves this recipe. Every time I bring it somewhere everyone asks for the recipe and raves about it!
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#I have tried many macaroni and cheese recipes but this was the best one I've ever tasted. My husband is not a big fan of mac and cheese but he ate seconds! 
Creamy Macaroni and Cheese#0#0#this is a very good recipe! everyone loves it every time i make it!!!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Can you use baking powder turns out I don't have soda. I have made these before they are always delicious. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Yum! So easy to make and really good!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#2#1#Great cookie! Made about 6 doz. but I used a TBSP. size scoop so I am sure that made a difference. Very moist and chewy in center.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#5#0#I made these and used them for ice cream sandwiches! They were a hit and everyone loved them with the homemade ice cream. I did not use the pudding mix since I did not have any.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#6#9#Did anyone omit the chips? (I'm not a fan of choc chips in my oatmeal cookie) 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#What a great oatmeal cookie! Since it's just the two of us, I did cut the recipe in half. The cookies were delicious and I will definitely be making them again. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#1#0#Everyone I share these cookies with always raves about them!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#1#1#This was an amazing recipe. I and my mother did it and the family had a special treat for after dinner... So good and scrumptious.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#1#0#These are soooo good! Will be making them again, for sure!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#1#0#I did not need 7 dozen cookies so I used half of all ingredients except for the oats. I used the cup the recipe called for and omitted the nuts. I also sprinkled flake coconut on top. This is now my favorite Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe! The vanilla pudding really adds body to the cookies and the texture and flavor are terrific.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#1#0#Have made these cookies several times and always get rave reviews. I send these cookies to my grandsons in Japan every Christmas and Easter, number one on their wish list.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#1#0#I just made these and I love the texture but they are too sweet for my taste. I wonder if I left the pudding out if it would change them too much?
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#1#0#These are phenomenal! I added shredded carrots and peanut butter. To die for!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#1#0#Very good but my Cookbook Taste of Home Best Loved Recipes says rounded tsp. not TBSP. So, 10 minutes was the max time as they browned pretty fast. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#1#0#These are great! They have a nice, crispy surface and chewy inside. I'll be making these again but perhaps adding 1.5 c chips. I bet they're great with dark chips as well. Thanks for sharing! 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#6#0#Not fair to rate a recipe lower because it sounds good but you haven't tried it. Don't rate it until you try it! And for heavens sake, don't change an ingredient ie quick oatmeal to old fashioned and blame the recipe if your cookies are dry. Old fashioned does make a drier chewier cookie as it soaks up more moisture from the eggs and butter. The oats are uncut and uncooked!! I always substitute while oats but then it isn't the same recipe is it
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These cookies are delicious! They turned out chewy and have a nice amount of chocolate. I used old fashioned oats as I did not have the quick cooking on hand.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#The absolute BEST oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever made!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Amazing. This might be my new favorite cookie - plenty of chocolate chips even for this chocolate lover. I only had while chocolate pudding mix but otherwise followed the directions exactly, other than making the cookies a bit bigger.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#1#0#Perfect cookie for dunking, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. I used a medium cookie scoop and baked them at 350 degrees for 10 minutes (convection setting). I flattened them slightly when they came out of the oven.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#2#1#I changed a few things. I used sugar-free pudding and chocolate chips, splenda to replace white sugar, splenda brown sugar blend (3/8 cup), and old fashioned oats (because that's what I had). They were a little drier than other cookies I have made, but they did hold together just fine. I was surprised mine did not flatten out but looked like haystacks when baked. 2nd batch I flattened before baking. They tasted fine either way, and I will make these again. Thanks for a healthier cookie recipe. I only got 4 dozen, but used a medium cookie scoop so that is probably why. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These were quite tasty! I loved the texture additions of the oatmeal and nuts. They are a nice change of pace from the usual regular chocolate chip or oatmeal cookies.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#3#0#To make things easier, I melted the butter before whisking in the sugar, and I made them into bars using a 15x10x1 jelly roll pan, baking for about 18 minutes until lightly browned around the edges. Let them cool completely before cutting/eating because they probably wouldn't have held together too well out of the oven.They were absolutely delicious! The oats were a little crispy, and they were very tasty. My husband is trying to keep them all for himself. I usually wouldn't make a recipe using convenience items like vanilla pudding, but I happened to have some in bulk I needed to use up (1/2 cup= a package). 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#2#The dough was very dry and I had a hard time keeping it together on the cookie sheet. They were falling apart. I used Old fashioned oats. I don't know if that made a difference, but I have made other oatmeal cookies with those oats and they were great. Will not make this recipe again. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#3#0#cookies were divine.ps: if you don't follow the recipe you cannot exactly blame TOH . just a thought .... use it don't use it. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#2#They were moist but not a big fan of the oatmeal with them. They were easy to make though.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#I am not a baker BUT you don't have to be! These cookies I baked for church were fabulous and so easy!!! Rave reviews!!! 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These were simply delicious. The only thing I did differently was I use the small chocolate covered raisins in place of the chocolate chips. I had some left over from the holidays and thought this was a great way to use them up. Will continue to make this way for my family, but if you are not a raisin fan, these are outstanding as the recipe is written.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Everyone liked these.I made half a recipe and got 39 cookies using my small (2 Tbsp.) cookie scoop.I also cut the sugar, but only to about 2/3 of the original amount. (They still are sweeter than I like them.) I also used whole wheat flour.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These cookies were delicious. The only difference is that I cut the sugars in half. Everyone raved about them.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#1#way too sweet and does not make 7 doz. I won't be making them again. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Delicious! Perfect when craving oatmeal and chocolate!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#1#I've made these twice now to take to gatherings with friends, and they always receive great reviews! The only thing that I would note is that I don't think the recipe makes 7 dozen cookies. I made a half batch last night and probably got around 30 small cookies out of it. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#5#These were really just okay. The dough was really dry and I hoped the cookies would be less so as the butter melted, but they weren't. It might have been because I used old fashion oats instead of quick-cooking. Running the old fashion oats through the food processor might have helped with the texture. I really dislike crisp cookies so I made them a little bigger than the rounded tsp and baked them for 8 minutes, but found even that to be too long! I ended up baking for 6 minutes and letting cool on the cookie sheet for 1.5 minutes before removing to a wire rack. They didn't really spread at all. I used chocolate pudding mix because that's what I had and I think it was too chocolatey; I also decreased the chips to 1.5 cups. Sorry, but I won't be repeating these. I'm beginning to lose faith in the TOH recipes. This is the 5th or 6th one in a row that hasn't wow'ed me. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#3#1#Great cookie recipe. I left out the nuts just because I am not a fan, but these still turned out really good. However, where the recipe says to drop by round teaspoonfuls, they mean really rounds ones. I tried just regularly rounded to begin with and my cookies were about the size of a silver dollar. They still tasted good, but they were a little hard. In the next batch I REALLY rounded up the teaspoon and got the correct size of cookie and it was softer in the center.The only thing I might change next time is to try adding some raisins!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#I made these twice over Memorial weekend to bring to two different events and these were a huge hit at both places. I think this may be the best chocolate chip recipe yet !!!!!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These cookies are fantastic!!! I followed the recipe exactly and my cookies came out perfectly! Best Choc. oatmeal cookie recipe i've come across! 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Excellent cookie ti enjoy with a cup of coffee! My granddaughter wanted to bake cookies today. We did. The only change we had to make was ;not enough of regular choc. chips- Used to different brands as well as size of chip. Baked each batch for only 10 minutes.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Never know for sure. When it says butter, is it salted or unsalted?
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Absolutely delicious! I didn't have instant vanilla pudding mix, but I did have chocolate pudding mix. They turned out so well, especially since I'm a chocolate addict! 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Stop looking! This is the best oatmeal chocolate cookie recipe! Not only did it make a lot of cookies, each cookie looked great- baked for 10min then let them sit on cookie sheet. As a volunteer food editor for Taste of Home, friends and family expect great cookies from my kitchen, these cookies did not disappoint!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Very good!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Perfect cookies and easy to make!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#1#These cookies were simple to make. I omitted the nuts (food allergy) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. They were delicious! This recipe makes plenty of cookies so I froze half. This just might be my go to chocolate chip cookie recipe from now on! 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These cookies were easy to make and my husband loved them. It's the only chocolate chip oatmeal cookie recipe he has liked. I make an entire batch and freeze most of it so there's always a nice treat without having to bake constantly. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#1#0#I followed the recipe EXACTLY except that I omitted the nuts. The dough is so dry it won't hold together. I added 2 tbsp of water. I was expecting a much much nicer tasting and nicer looking cookie. I went with this recipe because of a) the reviews and b) the ratio of oatmeal to flour. Will. NEVER make them again. I got 6 dozen buttons about 1.5 diameter. I see the other reviews and shake my head as to what went wrong. Maybe I should have added another egg or two but won't bother trying this recipe again. Sorry! 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These cookies were really good. I had only half of the amount of chocolate chips so usedbutterscotch chips with the chocolate chips. Yummy.Just couldn't stay out of the cookie jar! 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Delicious, and this is from someone who never cared for oatmeal cookies. My family loved them and so did I.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#I am trying to find a new favorite chewy oatmeal cookie, this one is pretty good. I was curious about the affect of the instant vanilla pudding.. The cookies seem pretty sweet, I will probably try them again by the recipe and see if they are the same. I didn't add the nuts and I thought my dough was a little dry, but the chewy factor is there. They don't flatten much so I kind of pushed them down when they came out of the oven. It's a keeper for sure. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Excellent cookies. I made them as directed and they are wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Since I didn't check my pantry before starting the recipe, I used both Crisco and butter in place of the latter; one packet of Dream Whip in place of the instant vanilla pudding; only one cup of chocolate chips (since that's all I had); and one cup of toffee bits (to make up for the missing mix-ins). Despite ALL of these changes, the cookies were chewy, moist, and *very* tasty. I've added it to my recipe box! 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#1#0#These are excellent. My family loves them. My husband had accidentally bought cook and serve vanilla pudding and I couldn't tell any difference. They were delicious. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Excellent recipe. I love that I don't have to chill the dough before baking and they freeze very well also. Thanks for sharing. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Excellent recipe! I used half coconut oil and half butter, coconut pudding and half vanilla, half coconut extract! Large pecan chunks and not all the choc chips! To die for!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#This recipe was very easy to assemble and bake. I didn't get quite as many cookies but it made a nice batch. We are enjoying them immensely. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These were delicious. chewy on the inside and a little crispy on the outside. My kids like them. Quick and easy to whip up. Will definately make again.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Add some dates for pallet pleasure!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#is the butter salted or unsalted?
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Fantastic recipe!! Made these for someone who like oatmeal cookies without anything in them and these turned out great.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#1#I've tried this with a 1/2 chocolate, 1/2 butterscotch blend. Dried cranberries and white chocolate chips was wonderful! I even doubled the recipe once but forgot to double the butter. They tasted great still. I always dump a little extra cinnamon in, too. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#I just made these and they are wonderful! My house smells so good.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#1#0#These were to die for!! Will make again. They were easy to make, and very delicious. My soccer tea loved them and couldn't put them down. They ate them all in about ten minutes. And we're only a team of 22!! My new favorite cookie recipe. Exactly what I was looking for. Great and quick to make. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These are some of the best cookies I have ever made! I doubled the vanilla, decreased the flour, and used sugar free pudding. Delish!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#This is a new family favorite! We made half with chocolate chips and half with raisins. I also doubled the vanilla. Very tasty!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Love the flavor and that it make a lot of cookies :)
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Loved the flavor and that it make a lot of cookies :)
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Very Good
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These cookies are amazing. I have baked them many times and not had any problems with them. I have added white chocolate chips and craisins to be different. Great cookies!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Way too sweet, too many chips in each cookie, too much sugar, then added sugar from the pudding...just too much for me.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Everyone at the office LOVES these cookies!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#The first batch of 84 servings was gone in just a couple of days, so I have to make another batch. My family loved these! I used half raisins and half choc chips.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#I used a chocolate pudding mix and they are great!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These cookies are GREAT. I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup and put in cranberries instead of chocolate chips. They don't last long inour house, 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Dealing with gestational diabetes isnt easy when you have a sweet tooth! I made these cookies more diabetic friendly...and they were still amazing good. Here were my changes. I substituted Splenda for the sugar. Subbed Splenda brown sugar for the brown sugar and reduced it to half a cup. I used vegetable spread instead of butter. I used one and a quarter cup of whole wheat flour instead of one and half of white. I used sugar free pudding mix. I used one half cup mini semi sweet chocolate chips. A lot of changes I know but it made a delicious satisfying cookie that is low enough in carbs for everyday enjoyment. I tried it a few ways to come up with this set of subs and they produce the best results. Enjoy!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Wonderful! Made just like the recipe, no changes and they are absolutely a great oatmeal, choc chip and pecan cookie. Yummy!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#This is a good oatmeal cookie recipe soft and chewy.yum
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#To add to my review--I didn't have vanilla pudding mix, but I did have cheesecake pudding mix. So I used this instead. Very good. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Perfect blend of gooey-ness & chewiness!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#1#Just made these using a couple of the other reviewers suggestions: I used chocolate fudge pudding and whole wheat flour. My husband loved them. I felt they were a bit on the dry side, though tasty. The dryness could be the result of using whole wheat flour...I will try the recipe again with all purpose flour :( to see if that was why they were so dry...
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#I followed the instruction. And i had to put another half a butter and another egg to get it to conform.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These were very good! I used whole wheat flour and old-fashioned oats. This recipe is a keeper.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#The vanilla pudding mix keeps these little fellas so moist. I used more brown sugar then regular sugar, and raisins instead of chocolate chips. I can't wait to try different pudding in these! 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#I made these with chocolate pudding, because I had no vanilla pudding. Made with King Arthur whole wheat flour. Forgot to set timer; remembered cookies just before they started to burn. Absolutely wonderful dipped in a glass of milk or cup of coffee, especially if you cook them too long--just like a superb biscotti or scone!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These are very good! I've been making them for awhile now. I really don't change a thing but like to add just a bit more salt because I love a good salty sweet mix. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These cookies are amazing!! I am a chocolate lover so I used chocolate pudding mix and Hershey's dark chocolate chips, also left out the nuts and replaced with Nestle chocolate chunks. The cookies didn't flatten out much for me either, but still very tasty! Will definitely be making these cookies many more times :) 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Burnt the first three dozen. The cookied didn't spread as they baked, so I ended up with burnt little balls. Flattened out the last batch a bit and they baked perfectly. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Delicious! Soft, moist, easy....my new favorite cookie recipe.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Mmmmmmmmm...so good. My son gobbled up 8 of them right from the oven. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Love this oatmeal cookie, have made it many times but this is the first time I usedchoc.instant pudding instead of vanilla andloved the results, very chocolaty also used semi-choc.chips and milk choc.chips. and left out the nuts,they were just delicious. I was very pleased with the results. thanks
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#So yummy and chewy. Did not use the pudding mix. Cooked at 350° for 10 min.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#delicious- I used golden raisins and white chocolate chunks-
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Very good cookies...will be making these again soon!!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Yum
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#1#So good and chewy! I substituted the nuts for m&m's. Be sure not to overcook though. I also tried this with chocolate pudding and it was also really great. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#1#0#WOW! Love these cookies! They are soft and chewy and the flavor is fantastic! I also added a cup of raisins, and only had French vanilla instant pudding, but it worked just as well. I had to bake them for 15 minutes, but I may have made mine a little larger. Instead of butter I used Smart Balance. These cookies could not have been better and I will make them again and again.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These were a definite winner in my house. I left out the nuts and used butterscotch pudding. Very yummy!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#I used my small Pampered Chef cookie scoop and got a total of 85 cookies. 10 minutes was just enough time. When I took them out of the oven, I gave the pan a tap on the counter to flatten the cookies a little more. I left out the nuts and used French vanilla pudding. They turned out perfect!! Definately a do again.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Phenomenal recipe. Outstanding in every way. Texture, taste....it is all wonderful.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe ever! The vanilla pudding adds a depth and richness. Chewy even the next day. I've used regular cook-and-serve pudding and instant, and it worked great using either. My family can't stop eating these cookies! 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#This is my all-time favorite cookie recipe. I have made it many times for a snack at home or to take to a get-together. Always a hit among my friends, I enjoy using a cup of chocolate chips and a cup of dried cranberries for a sweet, chocolately flavor. Wonderful taste, texture and small enough so that one or two cookies won't ruin your diet! 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#This is BY FAR the BEST oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe I have ever made or eaten!! They are delicious and I will DEFINITELY continue to come back to this one. Thank you Taste of Home.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Every body around my office liked them
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#A co-worker of mine is allergic to chocolate and nuts, so I made them with butterscotch chips. They seemed to be a good pair tasting with the vanilla pudding.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#mmmmmm! VERY YUMMY cookie! Everyone I shared them with thought so, too! The second time making them, I used White Chocolate flavor pudding. Hard to imagine them tasting any better than the original, but they were! It was a very subtle difference, but a good one. I'm a stickler for fresh -tasting baked goods, and these were too dry for me the second day. They were still very good, just not the same as the first day when they had that wonderful crispy outer layer and chewy inner layer. I solved the problem with my second batch by baking only the number of cookies I wanted each day, and storing the rest of the batter in the fridge. Voila! Fresh-baked flavor every day! Next time, I'll try freezing some, too, and see if that works well.Be very carful not to overbake them. One pan of mine came out quite brown on the bottoms (not burnt, though), and they didn't taste good at all to me. 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These cookies are fantastic. Super moist. Only thing I will change next time is to less than half the sugar, a little on the sweet side. Pudding gives them a very unique flavour.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#I have made these for 2 years now and my family loves them and so do the neighbors!! They have replaced my old recipe.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Update: The next day the cookies were on the hard side. I put a slice of bread in with them and they softened up. When I make them again I plan on adding a mashed banana as suggested by another reviewer.I'm hoping that will make them softer, and give them a little banana flavor. :^) 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These are great as written, but I added a twist-I used Banana instant pudding! I love the combination of banana, walnuts & chocolate. The banana flavor was very light-I may kick it up a bit next time by using 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 banana extract! Be sure not to overbake-mine definitely had to come out of the oven at the 10 minute mark to be soft & chewy!Enjoy!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These are by far the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I've ever made... and I bake A LOT! They come out perfect every time if you do just as the recipe says. The only thing I add is a bit more vanilla. Plus I refigerate my dough before baking so they don't flatten. If you're looking for a great, easy, crowd-pleasing cookie, this is it! 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#Good, but a little dry
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#1#These have become my very favorite chocolate chip cookie. Like gr8catmom, I also replace the granulated sugar with Splenda. It has twice as much oatmeal as flour. I also make sure and use a dark, bittersweet chocolate chip and not a semi-sweet. It satisfies your sweet tooth, is more filling and better for you.jmarie3j
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#I just made the cookies, never made any with pudding in , they turned out great. THANKS
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#I used sugar-free instant vanilla pudding mix and used Splenda as a replacement for granulated sugar. I left the butter, as is and WOW! gr8 cookie!
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#1#I've baked a lot of cookies in my time. A recipe with 1 cup butter and 1 1/2 cups flour plus the 3 cups of oatmeal is pretty standard and should make 3-4 dozen cookies. Since they tell you this recipe makes 7 dozen, it means they are tiny cookies, bite sized. So, yes, the calories and fat PER COOKIE is less.....but so is the cookie. Now, if we can eat just one.....but, I would want more than one. How about you? 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0# fatfree butter, isn´t that an oxymoron?
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#These cookies are fabulous. I have replaced my old recipe for this one. This is a keeper! My husband love the dough and my children love the cookies. With all my cookies, I will use my pampered chef mini scoop and make cookie dough balls and line them up on a baking sheet. Then freeze them until hard. I then store the dough balls in a marked ziploc bag in the freezer. This way, we can have homemade cookies whenever we want and not have to bake 6 or 7 dozen.
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#made it yesterday, all i can say?! YUMMY!!!! my kids loved them too ..thanks Diane for sharing this delish recipe :)
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#use fat free butter and fat free and sugar free pudding
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#I'm not sure how this is lower-fat but they are definately yummy. My whole family loved these chewy cookies. I only got 3 dozen cookies instead of the 7 the recipe suggests so the recipe cookies must be bite-size cookies. YUMMY-YUMMY!!! 
Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies#0#0#This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've ever come across. I brought some to a party this weekend and everybody said the same thing. They are delicious! I made them with mini-chocolate chips instead. This is now the only oatmeal cookie for me and my family. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#1#0#I love them! They are absolutely delicious. My grandma just got out of surgery and she loves these treats. It is all my families favorite ingredients. I love how they made the pattern with chocolate and peanut butter, making it taste even better!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#4#0#I made these yesterday, and they are delicious! I made them with Natural Peanut Butter, Truvia Powdered Sugar, and Sugar free chocolate. They tasted just like a regular peanut butter cup. They are very rich, so the smaller size worked very well. I got 33 cups and 2 just peanut butter filling because I ran out of chocolate, but that was plenty. Will definitely make these again.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#3#0#These are so simple to make and taste fantastic. Love giving these as Easter gifts. I always double the recipe
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#2#1#These were amazing! Easy to make and totally addicting. Love the mixture of the two chocolates. Taste like Reese's peanut butter cups. This is a definite keeper!! 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#21#3#These are excellent! I double the peanut butter mixture and use regular cupcake paper and put a layer of chocolate down, then a nice size dollop of the peanut butter mixture, then more chocolate. Make sure the peanut butter doesn't go to the sides. Otherwise, the chocolate won't seal around it all the way. Put them in the fridge until cooled. Then take scissors and cut the remaining paper above the chocolate off. This will make the original size peanut butter cups. These are so much better then the store bought ones and well worth the work!!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#6#7#A bear to make unless you have a steady hand.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#14#6#These are dangerous! My family all agreed they tasted better than Reese's peanut butter cups -- our favorite candy! This recipe was easy to follow and perfect as written but I tried some variations. I made them regular muffin sized and another time, I substituted white candy melts for the regular chocolate coating. Make these at your own risk! 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#11#17#John Harvey Kellogg was not the inventor of peanut butter. The credit goes to Marcellus Gilmore Edson, who obtained the first patent for peanut butter in 1884. Fourteen years later, Kellogg was granted a patent for a slight variation on Edson's original process. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#16#7#This is similar to a recipe I make. I found the recipe years ago but I don't care for peanut butter. So I simply use marshmallow cream and whip it up in the mixer and then continue with the recipe replacing the peanut butter with the marshmallow cream. These make great mallow cups. I keep the recipes ingredients around for when I get the taste for some chocolate. I make them in a regular cupcake pan and then wrap and take them to church for others so I don't pig out on them 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#25#12#Could milk chocolate chips be used instead of the milk chocolate bars?
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#We made these today with our daughter. It was an excellent recipe!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#5#0#Looks great! Haven't made them yet but was wondering if natural peanut butter will work. That's all I buy these days but would love to make these and don't want to ruin them. Thanks!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#2#0#Was a hit with everyone who tried them. They are better than R-----!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#3#Love this recipe but I melted the chocolate on my stove, I'm not good with the microwave. My husband absolutely loved these his opinion is They're better than the ones you buy in the store! This will be a staple in my cookie trays from now on
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#1#2#This is a good recipe, very similar to mine. I use paper candy cups so the candy doesn't stick. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#4#0#these are so easy to make! I put the chocolate in a freezer bag and cut off the tip it works great for putting the chocolate into the liners without making a mess. I also double the filling for more peanut butter inside the candys.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Very easy, though a little bit messy. But they sure are good! I've always been a Reese's fan, but they just lost a long time customer. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#2#1#This recipe turned out great! It took a while but was easy to make (particularly for candy). I look forward to taking them to my Christmas party tomorrow since they both look and taste almost like Reeses peanut butter cups. I am glad that I realized that the recipe calls for 4 1/2 TEASPOONS of butter, not tablespoons!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#2#0#I did not read the directions properly and accidentally added a whole stick of butter instead of 4-1/2 teaspoons... It was a taste of butter! Not many of these will be eaten haha. I will have to try again.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#5#8#Peanut Butter Cup BarsOkay so i tried making the cups prior and it was a mess and looked a mess the paper cups collapsed, I couldn't get them to look perfect.So this time I decided to make peanut cup Bars for Easter gifts thy look perfect. So much easier to make and you lessen the risk of not using the chocolate in time for it going all dry and lumpy.I bought candy/sweet clear bags. I tripled the amount of mixture. I used a non stick reusable sheet and lined an oven tray it covered almost half the tray the layers. I used galaxy bars, no cheap chocolate chips. So much smoother a taste for the chocolate really adds to the taste from what i've been told and I added Himalayan pink salt to the mixture of peanut butter.Microwaves are bad for you so i didn't use one , i don't have one, it changes the cellular structure of food and is harmful to dna. i just used a stainless steel pot on the cooker, filled with water on 3 and a smaller one on there for the chocolate mix and the the peanut butter mix.I did first layer put in freezer for 20 mins then did the peanut layer, easier to spread it when bottom layer is hard, same in freezer 20 mins then last layer of chocolate back in the freezer for 20 mins. Then using a cleaver, I cut it into big bars looks perfect and great.I got 3 pounds 8 ounces worth of bars and 10 big bars out of it. Much much easier to make these than to try make perfect cups. Anyone i've made these for prior, absolutely lovesssssss the taste.So going to wrap in greaseproof paper, then in yellow tissue paper inside the bag, then put into the clear bags, tie on yellow ribbons and glue a chick and an egg on ribbon and hand out for Easter :)Would be great fora photo upload function. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#1#0#Easy to make! Next time, I will use less chocolate and more peanut butter
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I made these with gluten-free ingredients for a friend... Yum!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#3#0#Delicious!! I make a ball of the peanut butter filling and push it into the choc. that way I know there is choc. all around the peanut butter.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Made these with my 6 and 8 year old girls for Halloween. Super easy and delicious and a nice large yield! This recipes a keeper!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#5#0#I'm definitely going to try these with my boyfriend and his family! - how long do they normally have to be refrigerated for until they are set? 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#My 15 year old daughter has been searching for simple recipes to make and share with friends. These were easy and really tasty. Her friends loved them.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#1#0#Taste like the real thing!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#These are so easy to make and they are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. :)
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#My family and I followed this recipe and it was fantastic. We used pipping bags and zip lock bags to put the chocolate and peanut butter into the mini cupcake cups. This made it go very fast and easy. We will be making these again.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I added a couple ounces of cream cheeseYum- smooth
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#3#1#I used only the filling ingredients, plus 1/2 t. vanilla, to fill some melted Belgian milk chocolate disks in silicone molds. Dusted top with toasted, crushed dry-roasted peanuts, using a sieve to keep the big chunks out. Results in a fluffy filling in chocolate. These cups taste best when chilled before eating. I liked the 1 size better than the 2 size I made. Prepared at Saint Paul College Culinary Arts school pastry class. Chef said Russell Stover move over when he tasted them for my proficiency grade. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Yum!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Made a double batch today ....so easy and sooo good. I added a tsp of mexican vanilla and omitted the salt. I used a honey peanut butter. These will be added to one of my favorites ??
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Very good and easy to make.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Easy to make and just as tasty as the store bought candy.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Great recipe and easy to follow instructions. I'll be trying these soon. My favorite! 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Delicious! I will make these again. Please...what happened to our choices to print recipes?
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#same way you make peanut butter bars
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#1#Very easy to make and they were quite a hit!!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#OMGoodness! We are hooked! My family loved these so much they said they should be illegal : ) thanks for the great copycat receipts we love them!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#These are delicious! I will definitely make these at Christmas and Valentine's Day from now on!! 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Yum!! So easy to make. I didn't have the candy bars required so I just used all milk chocolate chips and they still came out delicious and cute :-) 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#This turned out great and yielded exactly the quantity it stated with no leftover ingredients!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#These are very good and I make them every Christmas as part of my candy cooking. I use less salt and make one one quarter of the filling recipe.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#They are a family favorite at Christmas. Easy to make, also.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#very good!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I've been making these for years at Valentines Day. They're very cute. Putting the peanut butter in with the melted chocolate gives them a softer texture. My daughter loves them. They are a fun and inexpensive candy to make. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#These are delicious! Made them for a Christmas dinner party, people requested the recipe. Only made them as miniature size cause they are rich. I used a spoon to spread chocolate around sides of cups before dropping peanut butter. The top chocolate is easier to spread to cover.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Excellent! Change of sprinkles and mini liners make them perfect for any party. They are a hit on any holiday tray!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#1#Easy peasy! I made another 1/2 batch so I was expecting to get 44 peanut butter cups. I ended up with 8 1/2 dozen. I had to melt some more chocolate. Maybe I wasn't using enough peanut butter mixture in each one? At any rate they were a hit. I can't eat them but my kids & hubby said they were awesome :) 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Easy to prepare and easy to eat! I make these often for holiday treats and they can also be frozen. These come out twice the size of regular Reeses cups. So yummy.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Yes these are the best!!! My brothers LOVED them.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I like peanut butter cups, but was amazed at how good these really taste!! They taste better in my opinion than the name brand. And my 3 yr old daughter had a blast helping me make them, as well as putting her own sprinkles on top. I would definitely make again!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Loved this recipe. Made for Valentine's Day! Easy and yummy! 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#1#I'm not a fan of chocolate & peanut butter together, but my friends loved them & wanted the recipe. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I have made these peanut butter cups quite a few times! I really enjoy them! They taste better without the sprinkles but this is a personal preference. I make them at Christmas!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#1#0#I have made these a couple of times now. My family loves them just as much as Reeses'. I no longer take the time to make individual cups. I spread half the chocolate mixture in a bar pan lined with wax paper sling. Chill the bar pan until the chocolate is set enough to spread on the peanut butter mixture. Spread on the remaining chocolate (it may have to be reheated). Then cut into pieces. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#These were delicious and pretty simple. The filling is so tasty by itself! Just like Reese's. The hardest part was finding the right chocolate to peanut butter ratio. Mine did melt really easily in my hand, but that is my only complaint. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#1#0#Can be easily poured into silicone molds. Skip the cups and it's much less time consuming. These were a hit. Did not modify the recipe at all. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#These were a hit at potlucks. Very easy to make and can be poured into themed silicone molds for different occasions. Did not modify the recipe at all.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#well i did something completely different .. I made Peanut Butter eggs ... took a deviled eggmold & made a chocolate shell filled with peanut butter mixture & OMG they rocked much much better than a Reeses cup ! xoxoxox Sue
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#love it, husband begs me to make this over and over again
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#YUM! Time consuming, but worth it.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#These treats were so easy and delicious. The recipe is simple to follow and the Peanut Butter cups look professional. I made them for Valentines Day and my family keeps asking for them again!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I have a son who is allergic to peanut butter. Before he became allergic he ENJOYED peanut butter cups. Hasn't had one in 6 years. So for Valentine's Day I decided to substitute soy butter for the peanut butter in this recipe and it turned out AWESOME!!! You really can't tell the difference and he got to enjoy a long lost treat. I did prepare the soy butter filling ahead but only added an extra 1/2c conf. sugar because the soy butter is a little dryer than peanut butter and didn't want filling to crumble. Think next time I will add some crushed up pretzels to this and enjoy 3 great tastes together :-) Excellent alternative for people allergic to peanuts!!! 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I know I already posted a review but have some other helpful hints. I used a teaspoon melon baller to scoop heaping spoon of melted chocolate into cups then a slightly smaller one for peanut butter then back to larger one for top chocolate. Also put your cups on a tray covered in foil or pretty paper then you can refrigerate and serve on same tray. I don't think it was messy at all and when I melted chocolate and peanut butter I put pb on bottom glass dish then Choc. Melted about 45 secs stirred then another 45 secs. Wonderful and Very Easy! 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#1#Very good! I had no trouble melting the chocolate mixture in the microwave. I used half power and checked (and stirred!)every 30 - 45 seconds~~no problem. I did increase the powdered sugar to 1 cup and rolled the mixture out into 3 logs each 9 inches and them scored them every 3/4 inch and refrigerated them until firm. Then followed the directions for putting them together in the recipe putting the little chucks of peanut butter mixture in each cup instead of having to spoon it in. I was really impressed that this recipe worked out perfectly with the quantities given and made the 36 cups exactly. I'll use it again. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Was so easy to make for my valentines!I added 1/2 cup chopped fine salted peanutsTo filling for the same texture as Reese's and they are the bomb! Husband and son love them! Said better than Reese's.thank u 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Made these last evening after receiving the e-mail. Took about an hour start to finish. Yummy, easy, & look fabulous! More delicious than Reeses! My Valentines will love them, just like I do!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I made these last night for V Day. They look great and the one I ate was delicious! I am glad the weather is cool as I am sure they have a low melting point. The piping bag suggestion for the filling was so helpful. I wonder if that would work with the chocolate also?
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Everyone loved these! I did alter them slightly: instead of using 1/2 cup PB with the chocolate, I used 1 TBS oil. It made the chocolate very rich and creamy. I also needed extra powdered sugar to get the PB to hold together, and added a splash of vanilla as an afterthought. A great, basic and quick recipe that can be altered to fir your tastebuds!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#very good but too messy to be practical. It does not set up well and must be refrigerated. I made them for Valentine gifts but can not include them on a tray. I will have to give them out separately- from my frige to theirs. I will not make again!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I am so disappointed in this recipe. When I went to melt the chocolate ingredients, it never melted, I tried mixing with an electric mixer, nothing, it turned out lumpy no matter what I did. I spent abougt $8.00 on ingredients I have to throw away. Maybe you should explain better the melting process of the chocolate.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#So easy and delicious! Everyone loved them at work =)
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#made these in both small & larger sizes at Christmas 2011. They were quick & easy & the best peanut butter cups! Family loved them!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Very tasty. Try increasing confectioners' sugar to a scant 2 cups, knead with hands as it is much drier in texture. Roll into one or two logs slightly smaller in diamiter than the paper cups you are using, chill. Cut into rounds. Follow directions for filling paper minature muffin cups. Much faster and easier. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Very easy to make and they were gone in a flash!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Easy to make and absolutely delicious!!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#These were very good, I found it easier to pipe the filling in, I could push it down into the chocolate and get more into each cup :)
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Made these for the holiday.......big hit, better than Reese's peanut butter cups and very easy. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#This was a fun and easy recipe. They taste just like a from the store. I've melted chocolate in the micorowave before and it is always a disaster but the peanut butter seemed to keep it from getting hard. I as well did not add the salt and it was fine. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Grandchildren and the holidays are beautiful. Today made these chocolate peanut butter cups with my Grandsons. I should say, the kids made them start to finish. I just supervised and answered questions. Along the way, we practiced reading, reading fractions and division (cutting things in half). Both did VERY well and we all got ?decorated? along the way. They had fun. Just call me Disneyland Grandma. I do not care for peanut butter so I have not tasted them. However, the rest of the family thought they were wonderful and tasted just like Reese's cups and they were not just saying that to encourage the kids. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#This is alot like the receipe I have used for over 30 years, I use chocolate almond bark I dont see the reason for adding salt it does not need it
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#So easy and soooo good! Took a while since I only had one tray to use but i was able to make a batch between cooking my cookies so it worked out perfectly! Will make again.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I made these for our annual Adult Christmas program at the church. Everyone raved about them. I have made these every year since for Christmas and Valentines for my family. The kids love em' too. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#These were very easy & so yummy - a real hit! The chocolate outside is smooth & creamy with a hint of peanut butter to match the filling - will make again!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I, like Senzascusa, also rated these before but the review also disappeared. Although, I found them time consuming, it was worth it. These are delicious & I would make them again.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#make them every year as Xmas gifts
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#These are Excellent! Everyone loved them. The extra time it takes to put them into the cups makes it all worth it.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I HAVE rated these before, but my review has disappeared as have all the others. Weird. Anyway, these are amazing and taste very much like real Reese cups. Really loved then and should really make them again soon! Time consuming on the whole filling the cup thing, but worked well. I also tried making some into Easter egg shapes, but the chocolate didn't harden very hard, so they didn't keep their shape well. In the cups it was fine. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Easy to make, delicious, & popular!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Fantastic and tasted VERY similar to a REESE CUP. When I first put in the salt and tasted it I got scared it ruined it, but then realized it was perfect and tasted just like Reese! The chocolate/PB mix is GREAT too however I found it quite soft--but then so are Reese cups. However I made these into Easter Eggs and for that the choco was too soft and the eggs crushed easily. Nonetheless they tasted fab and my 5-yr old said I should make them EVERY DAY!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#This recipie is a gold mind because you can improvise like take out the penut butter and put in caramel but penut butters fine these are fudgy and yummy
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I have to make these for every family function! Everyone absolutely loves them! They melt in your mouth!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Will definately make these again. A big hit!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I only have ghirardelli (don't know how to spell it) milk chocolate chips....snow storm so I will be snowed in for a few days....is that ok to use? or will it not taste good? thanks! 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#To answer the last question...yes it is 4 and 1/2 tsp. This is a super recipe! Always yummy. Chooclate and Peanut butter. You can't got wrong! Easy and great to eat! 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#It's 4 1/2 teaspoons. These are SO good! 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I want to make sure I do this right, just wondering is it 4 and a half teaspoons of butter or 4, 1/2 teaspoons of butter? Thank you.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I've been making peanut butter cups since I was 10 years old. Finally I found the perfect ones! Everyone loves these. You can't make enough of them! 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#These are absolutely delicious..... Everyone loved them & I would difinately make them again!!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#1#they are good but not as great as everyone is raving about.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#1#0#I made these and they are YUMMY!Thanks for sharing this great recipe!Jesus is my King, is He yours?Abigail
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#2#0#These were so easy and amazing!!! I used good quality chocolate candy bars and instead of the semisweet chocolate chips, I used milk chocolate. I also sprinkled the top with a little kosher salt before they set. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#So much better than Reese's! These are so yummy! I used an actual teaspoon to drop out the chocolate mixture (it was nice and runny) and used a baby spoon for the peanut butter mixture just to make sure I eyeballed it correctly. I halved the recipe and still came out with 24 cups. I am definitely making these again! Super easy, too. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#100% Delicious!!!!! This recipe is a winner to my family and I. Very Easy and FUN!!!!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#These were pretty easy to make, with absolutely to-die-for results! (and they look pretty, too!) My husband and I loved them. I did run out of chocolate at about 2.5 dozen, but next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I will be more careful with spooning out the chocolate. :) Yummm!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#They were very good and easy to make. Thank you
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#These are so delicious and so easy to make!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I used more peanut butter and confectioners sugar to give it a less soft texture. Very delicious.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#terrific..everones favorite
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Made for Christmas and they were a hit. I used less salt because of high blood pressure but they still were great.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#People just rave every time... Way better than Reese's! 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!! It was the best thing i ever made and had
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#This is always a birthday gift request from one of my grand-daughters. Of course they are always made with love.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#These are to die for! One warning: taste these and store-bought will never taste as good again. These are so creamy and delectable, really nothing else compares. Plus, no additives! Better all around.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I made these for Christmas as well and they were delicious. Everyone loved them and there were no leftovers! I will definitely make these again!!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I made these for Christmas for my cookie exchange gifts. My grandchildren thought they were the best ever, even better than ones from the store. Edie C
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Loved the peanut butter cups! Made them as gifts over Christmas and used the leftovers on a party platter. They were the first things to go and everyones favorite!!!!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Way too much salt! I should have followed my instinct and added only 1/4 t instead. They were good aside from that.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#The Peanut Butter Cups are wonderful. Takes a bit of time to make, but well worth it. They are so much better than the commercial peanut butter cups.Jbay
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#do you store them in the fridge after they set or store at room temp?
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#This is an AWESOME recipe! :D :D 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I'm planning on makeing these overly-delicious candies for Christmas. I think I'll hand them out to all I know (I'm NOT gaining weight alone this year)! 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#How long will these last after they're made? Stored in the airtight container in the refrigerator? I'm so looking forward to making them!! 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#These were a big hit when I made them. Not dry like the store bought kind that are made months in advance. I keep these in the refrigerator until ready to serve because they do tend to get a little soft at room temperature. You can use papers and sprinkles to fit the occassion or holiday.
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Made these for my husband to take to work for Valentine's Day. They were a big hit and a coworker asked for the recipe. Very easy to make. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#These are excellent! I love reese's peanut butter cups and these are just as good! 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#I plan to make these with my daughter for valentines day.  We are going to give them to family and friends.  Can't wait to try them; should be fun to make.  
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#My significant other and I just absolutely love these little chocolates! We doubled the recipe so that we could give them away! These little beauties are wonderful!
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#Very easy recipe the kids made them and they are great! Will keep this recipe around. Thanks
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#These are fantastic! My 5 year old and 2 year old helped me make them the first time, and we've made 2 or 3 more half batches in the last two weeks! They're a big hit when my husband's friends come over to hang out. 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0# This sounds great (and looks good too) - I can't wait to try it out 
Homemade Peanut Butter Cups#0#0#My co-workers love Peanut Butter cups so; I made these for treat day tomorrow. I had to taste one they are great. I made them exactly as the recipe is written. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#2#0#Quick, easy and good. I am definitely going to make this again
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#6#0#First time I ever made shepherd's pie! Really appreciate this recipe it tastes really great can't thank you enough looking into the next recipe now 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#3#Great recipe
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#9#3#Everyone loved this. I love how quick it was to make. So easy if you use the prepackaged containers of mashed potatoes. I used canned veggies and one beef bouillon cube. The sour cream was a nice touch.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#20#0#The whole family really enjoyed this. I liked that it was easy to make on a weeknight. I used a cast iron skilled and then put it in the oven to heat with foil over it. Then broiled the cheese for the last 5 minutes.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#2#0#Really enjoyed this. The whole family, even the picky eaters, ate it up. I liked that it was not labor intensive for such a flavorful meal. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#10#3#This is easy to prepare and very tasty. I doubled the recipe and fixed it in a Dutch oven. It one of my son's favorites. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#13#104#I am always amazed at the lack of knowledge of British dishes.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#32#1#This recipe is wonderful as written. It's been on my rotation for months. I also switch it up using sausage and whatever veggies I have in the freezer. It's easy, tasty and satisfyingly filling. 5 stars! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#27#1#I was worried there wasn't going to be enough flavor with the ingredients measured as written. I was wrong! This is a wonderful dish made as originally listed. Will make again. Was almost better as leftovers! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#12#0#Delicious & easy!!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#11#2#I found this to be very tasty and easy to make. For those who find ads are covering part of the recipe, try a different browser. The ads I'm seeing are below and/or to the right of the recipe, ingredients, and comments. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#7#2#This is always a favourite in our home on a cold winter night. Good comfort food!!!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#9#2#This looks good. I tend to makes same dishes for a long time. It's time for some different meals. Especially ones that are easy to copy. I can change it as i see fit. And thank whoever wrote it for sharing!! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#106#3#Good,easy recipe. For all u snarky bullies who feel the need to comment that it's not technically Shepherd's Pie - please get over yourselves. Many recipes that refer to themselves as spaghetti sauce or enchiladas are not necessarily authentic, but rather americanized versions of delicious dishes. Smh 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#5#0#Very good. recipe/ Just make sue you use a deep dish skillet to stir everything. I usually use a bag of frozen mixed vegetables. have made it several times and it always a hit!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#6#2#I agree with Chris. I can't even make this recipe because there are so many ads popping up or covering things. Very disappointing.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#5#2#I'm sure the recipe is great, but the add, obviously ok'd by Taste of Home is cutting off the last 3 ingredients on the list. Really, really poor planning Taste of Home!!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#3#0#SO EASY AND SO YUMMY, MY DAUGHTERS HUSBAND FAVORITE
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#6#1#I just made the shepards pie. This is the first time I've made it, and in fact the first time I've eaten it. I didn't have peas, so I used twice the amount of corn. I really liked it. This is something that I will make again. Thank you for this recipe as well as all the others you have provided. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#12#1#My husband and sons are very picky eatersone of my sons is a chef. They all loved this dish. I made it exactly according to the recipe except that I topped it with some green onions (on top of the cheddar at the end.) I love that I can make this with ingredients I regularly keep around the house. Very flavorful. Thanks for this one. It's a keeper!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#4#0#This is a great recipe. True comfort food! The only change I make- I use frozen mixed vegetables in place of the peas and corn. I have also made it with pork. Joyce Moynihan, Volunteer Field Editor
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#6#0#My husband loves shepherd's pie, so I had to make this when I saw the recipe (he loves corn, too); and I have to say this is the best tasting shepherd's pie. Easy to make - with a yum-yum factor that has him raving. Thank you TOH! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#4#1#This recipe was super easy to make and my whole family loved it, including my picky 4 and 6 year old girls. Glad I found this. Will definitely add to my rotation of meals. I typically have all these ingredients on hand.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#2#24#This recipe is Cottage Pie not Shepherds Pie. Shepherds pie uses lamb. My tweeks: I did not use corn or sour cream. I baked it in the oven after putting it all together. I used peas and carrots and mashed cauliflower. It was superb! I made it again with ground turkey.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#3#0#We got snowed in so i made this it is so easy
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#5#2#We really liked this dish. I didn't even serve anything else with it because it is a complete meal in itself. Until this recipe, I thought all shepherd's pie dishes were baked in the oven. Pretty easy to make . I even used venison ground beef instead of regular ground beef. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#DELICIOUS Recipe! FYI: Chicken or beef bouillon granules can be found in the soup aisle. Herb-Ox is the only kind I have seen, comes in a small jar.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#8#2#My mother used to make this, but she would pour the mixture into a baking dish before adding the mashed potato topping. Then she would bake it in the oven for 30 minutes at 325-350 degrees Fahrenheit. It was a wonderful meal on a cold winter evening.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#3#1#I made this a couple of weeks ago and my family enjoyed it so much they asked me to make it again. So I made it tonight. I didn't add the sour cream because my husband doesn't like it. I didn't have any more worchester sauce left so I substituted A1 sauce. Also I used canned mixed vegetables, which I drained and washed to get rid of salt. Still delicious. Winner. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#I had a similar need of chicken bouillon powder. I found it in the Hispanic aisle at Walmart - Knorr Caldo con Sabor de Pollo - a 35 oz jar for less than $4
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#Knorr makes beef bouillon granules. Sometimes you have to look in the Mexican foods section.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#Mpesci, I needed beef bouillon granules for something else I make and couldn't find them locally either. I ended up ordering them online. Bought 3 jars and that was over a year ago. Just opened the second jar. You can also crush the cubes if you really need to. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#Where do you find beef bouillon granules? I've looked and looked for them and cannot find in grocery stores in Indianapolis. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#2#0#Long back my aunt made a shepherds pie-guess that was some 34 or 37 years back-never had shepherds pie since then-loved it then and am happy that I was reminded of those days and -lovely recipe-yummy.thanks
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#A family favorite I make several times.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#2#1#This is my all time favourite recipe! I actually make it with Gardein vegetarian ground beef and use vegetable broth instead of beef broth as i'm vegetarian and it's soooooooooo good. My meat loving husband and step-son request this meal all the time. &lt;3 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#after reading it seems tasty and yummy will def give it a try!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#2#0#This dish was phenomenal! Hubby and I both loved it! The only change that I made was using tomato paste rather than ketchup, which was a kitchen tip. I also, put the tomato paste before the peas and corn to let it cook out and develop flavor; then Worcestershire sauce and garlic stirring to incorporate before adding the vegetables. I also divided in half: Topped one with our Cheddar Mashed and Cheese and froze the other just the meat mixture so when we are ready to eat we just need to top with potatoes and cheese.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#11#While this is a yummy recipe, its actually NOT a Sheppard's Pie. Sheppard's Pie is made with ground lamb. What you have made it a cross between a Cumberland pie (beef and breadcrumbs on top) and a Canadian Pâté chinois (beef 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#2#1#I made this last week and it was very good. The sour cream adds richness to the dish. I added salt and pepper to taste and used white cheddar cheese (I'm allergic to Annatto, the food dye used to color many yellow cheeses and other foods). My husband loved this dish, so I will be making it again. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#Excellent recipe. It is versatile and I made a few tweaks for our family's taste, but everyone enjoyed it and will be making it again. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Love the recipe! I divide it in half a make two dinners. One now and one to freeze or give away.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Great family friendly recipe! Easy to make on a week night. Will definitely make this again.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#17#Where do I start..... Way to sweet, the corn & sweet peas DO NOT make good lovers. This isn't any 30 minute meal by a VERY long shot. Maybe a few peas and carrots. I used tomato paste instead of ketchup. I can only imagine how sweet it would've been with the ketchup. I used beef broth( I never like the granules or cubes). The after taste makes me want to hurl right now. I hate throwing food in the garbage but another meal of this wasn't going to happen. I even added some fresh ground pepper to cut the sweetness. Thank the heavens for pepper. I looked forward to eating this recipe and I am very bummed about throwing $$$$ down the drain. Fellow culinary participants...Stay away from this recipe. Very sad right now. If I could give no stars I would. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#Everyone loved this dish. I made it super easy by using frozen chopped onions and instant potatoes. But after reading some of the comments, I can see it's a very vestal recipe. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#2#0#This is a good base to start from. I use broth in place of water in any meat based recipe - have used beef or mushroom in similar recipes. I don't like adding flavouring cubes, granules or liquids if they contain MSG and other chemicals I check for - I'd rather get flavour from natural sources so my allergies don't act up, plus it's healthier. I have used corn and peas, also mixed frozen veggies and peas and carrots - whatever I have on hand - or am in the mood for. I have been known to make the meat and veggie mixture - in multiples of the amount in this recipe - in a Dutch oven so I can freeze some for later use. Have also added mushrooms, fresh (preferably) or canned. I always grind a generous amount of pepper into the base - always taking samples for tasting before calling it complete - the same with salt - which I go easy on. The sour cream is a nice twist and I have also used cream cheese in the base. Sooooo many possibilities! Thanks for sharing. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#Very tasty & filling! Pretty quick & easy too.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#I made this the night before Thanksgiving Day I when I was plenty tired and had had enough dishes to wash during the day! I was so glad it could be served in the same skillet used to cook it in and not have to transfer to the oven like other Shepherd's Pies. I always use Yukon Gold potatoes to make mashed potatoes with--it really ratchets up the flavor. I do think, as another reviewer stated, that the meat/veggie mixture needed some salt added before the potatoes were spread on top. Update--9/21/2017: I am scheduled for foot surgery soon and cannot stand for long periods of time SO I made this even quicker. For the sauce, I used Campbell's Beefy Mushroom soup with some sour cream added and for the potatoes, I made very thick instant ones with some of the sour cream added. I received no complaints from 3 men--they loved it! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#This was pretty good. I just used mixed vegetables. This recipe is very similar to another one of our favorite Taste of Home recipes: Stovetop Goulash.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#This is excellent. I added 1/2 a chicken bullion cube as well. I am eating the leftovers for lunch and reheated beautifully. I will make this again. Janet. VFE
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#Made exactly as written and it was good. I would add seasoning next time. The reheated leftovers were even better the next day. Will make again and think garlic mashed potatoes would be great. Thanks
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#2#0#This was a very easy recipe. It tasted great. I did leave out the peas. Other than that, I made ether same recipe.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#2#I've been making this since high school in the 1960's and always used hamburger meat. So the ingredient to use typically depends on which contry your from. In the US is typically beef.See from Wikipedia: In early cookery books, the dish was a means of using leftover roasted meat of any kind, and the pie dish was lined with mashed potato as well as having a mashed potato crust on top.[7][8]The term shepherd's pie did not appear until 1854, and since then it is sometimes used synonymously with cottage pie , regardless of whether the principal ingredient is beef or mutton. In the United Kingdom, the term shepherd's pie is typically used when the meat is lamb. ] 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#4#0#I don't care what it's called, we call it darned good!! Very comforting dinner and easy to prepare! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#If I want comfort food and I want dinner - THIS is the perfect recipe! Very easy to make - all though, I'll admit, I left out the Worcestershire sauce and added in a few other spices instead. Butt hat's just personal preference. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#2#0#This is easy to make and has good flavor. I added 1/2 tsp. of salt, and 1/4 tsp. of black pepper to the meat and onion mixture based on what others had said. I didn't have any sour cream, and I used canned corn instead of frozen, and topped the potatoes with white cheddar. My husband gave it a thumbs up! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#3#0#This Shepherd's Pie has a wonderful taste to it. It comes together quickly. I substituted canned green beans & corn for the frozen because that is what I had on hand. Will definitely be making this again! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#After 3 helpings of this dish, my husband said I could add this dish to our weekly dinner rotation. I added chopped carrots instead of the corn along with a teaspoon as thyme and it was delicious. Definitely a keeper!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#3#3#Why do people get so hung up on recipe titles? Ridiculous! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#2#2#Very decent basic recipe for COTTAGE pie. Shepherds pie has to have lamb or mutton. Nice for meal when you don't want oven on- edit 10/12/16 Because Cindy- it IS Cottage Pie- call it what it is. It is still a good recipe-for NOT TURNING ON THE OVEN, YOU are being ridiculous 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#1#Was a real hit with my family. I used carrots and beans from our garden in place of corn & peas and baked in the oven because my skillet wasn't big enough. I'm a volunteer Field Editor and enjoy testing out recipes. We loved the flavours in this dish! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Jim and Dee likes. Better then other recipes that were tried
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Hi Temyli,The freezing instructions are at the bottom of the recipe directions above.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Is this freezable? Planning on a fishing trip and don't want to be tied to the kitchen. To many fish to catch and if I could freeze would I need a tin touch-away pan? 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#My family loved this recipe! I added carrots rather than the peas. I also added Tony Chachere's seasoning to the hamburger mixture and paprika sprinkled on the mashed potatoes. Excellent! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#This is very different from the traditional Shepherd's Pie recipe that I usually make and we enjoy so I wasn't sure about this recipe that has so many vegetables, sour cream, ketchup, etc. . I decided to give it a try based on the many positive comments and I am glad I did. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but added a bit more seasoning as others suggested and broiled it the last couple minutes. Delicious! I will definitely make this again. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#I did a few things differently. First, I didn't put all of the veggies in because it looked like way too much. I also didn't put in as much onion and instead added some chopped celery. Because others stated it was a bit lacking in flavor, I added some parsley, basil, and steak rub seasoning. I also used store-bought mashed potatoes.At the end I stuck it all in a dish, and put it in the oven at 350deg for about 15 minutes. Next time I will also broil it for a couple minutes too, like others suggested.One thing I did notice was a distinct sweetness to it. I think it was a combination of the ketchup and the large amount of corn. Next time I will cut down on the corn and add in a different veggie (maybe broccoli). While the sour cream made the sauce taste good, I didn't really get a strong sour cream flavor (info for those who are on the fence about adding in the sour cream).Overall, a good dish, and pretty quick when using leftover or store-bough mashed potatoes. We will make this again with a few changes. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#This was excellent! Had everything in my pantry except peas so I used green beans instead. Hubs said this is a keeper. Quick and easy!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#This gets 5 stars because both of my picky eater daughters loved it..one meal and two kids liking it..wow, that rarely happens! Personally I needed to add some salt and pepper on my plate. Thank you for this great tween-friendly recipe!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#2#0#I'm giving this five stars, tho I did have to make some substitutions based on what I had on hand. I used some leftover beef roast, about 2/3 bag of frozen mixed veg medley, almost a whole jar of turkey gravy with some generous splashes of Worcestershire sauce, some leftover mash, and some crunched up tater tots (to make up for my small amount of mash). I layered on some processed cheese, you know, the kind that comes in a 2#loaf, and just left it to bubble away. My husband declared it some really good comfort food , which was perfect after the crummy, rainy day we had. So, please forgive me, reviewer purists out there. For everyone else, I'll just say this recipe is very forgiving. It's hard to go too wrong with a combo of beef, veggies and potatoes, especially when you only have to wash one pan. Oh, and I didn't add the sour cream, because I knew, with only the two of us, there would be leftovers and I didn't know how that would hold up. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#EXCELLENT!! My husband ate ALL the leftovers...so I'll be making this again and again! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#I haven't tried this but I'm giving it 5 stars for the idea alone, it sounds amazing. Thanks!!I don't use bullion, but will use beef broth in place of water . Can't wait till the leftover turkey is all gone to try this!! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#excellent and easy
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Good base recipe. Next time I will add seasoning. Needed salt, pepper, thyme and bay leaf. The sour cream made it very creamy. Next time I will stick with just the beef broth and put some sour cream in the potato. I did add celery and carrots.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#This turned out well and was quite easy. We don't like peas much so I added some finely chopped carrots and mushrooms and used tomato paste rather than ketchup. Nice dinner for a cold day.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#This is an exceptional Shepherd's Pie. The sour cream just adds a special richness and flavor almost like a Stroganoff. Never would I have ever thought to add sour cream to Shepherd's Pie filling. I add fresh thyme leaves to taste and as usual swap out the Worcestershire for steak sauce, no anchovies for me. As far as the veggies go I always use whatever I feel like, even Brussels sprouts once. I add a couple of bay leaves and fresh ground black pepper to my potato water when boiling and then when I mash them I add a packet of onion soup mix, butter and heavy cream are a must. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#Really great, simple recipe. Like others have mention it needs more seasoning but I usually change seasoning to most recipes, so not an issue for me.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#This was really good... I did add extra seasoning (garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper).
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Easy weeknight dinner. The sauce needs a little extra seasoning.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#good meal!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Really enjoyed this recipe,and my family loved it. Thank's for sharing. LeeAnn Treacher 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#This is a great and easy recipe, my husband has me freeze what is left, so when he gets the urge defrost and heat, does this well.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#I have not yet prepared this dish, but just by reading the ingredients and the instructions, it sounds very easy to make, and also very tasty. It's now on my'Must Try' list of recipes. I'll add in some saut?ed mushrooms, since my family and I like them. Otherwise, this dish sounds terrific to me, and I can't wait to make it. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#This was very easy to put together - from start to finish 35 minutes. Substitutions: Instead of frozen corn I used a can of yellow/white corn which I drained, omitted the peas as my boyfriend does not care for peas, browned the hamburger with the onion & garlic and used Johnny's seasoning salt on the meat. For the mashed potatoes I used a package of Idahoan Bacon with Cheese mashed potatoes adding about 1/4 c. extra water. Then right before serving I put it under the broiler to get the cheese browned. My boyfriend said it's a keeper . 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Good and made with things you would normally have on hand!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Excellent, easy, fast, and enough to freeze for another time. Just hubby and me.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#Easy to fix and delicious. It freezes well and my son often takes a container to his home for dinner. He enjoys shopping for dinner via the freezer. Use beef froth rather than water and cube which is convenient. Very satisfying dinner. Thank you for teaching an old dog a few new tricks.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#I just made this. As a matter of fact, I have my empty bowl sitting in front of me. Still more on the stove. Well, anyway, I made the mashed potatoes from instant. I could have easily doubled the amount called for in the recipe. Probably not if you use real potatoes. I used canned veggies to skip the thawing. Any way you make this dish it will turn out great! Gotta go, seconds are calling my name...
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Nothing fancy, but fine for a simple meal.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#Pretty good, but make sure to use a 12 skillet. I also recommend changing the last step. I used a cast iron skillet, & after adding the cheese, I put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#This was quick and easy. I also didn't realize the vegi's had to be thawed and threw them in frozen, still came out great. Everyone loved it! I will definitely be making this again! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#OMG !!! I have tried various recipes, for Shepherd's Pie.... It never came out to be very tasteful .... This recipe is by far the best. This is the way I will forever make it now. I changed it up just a little bit.....used canned corn instead, no peas ...because I don't like them. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#Made this last night pretty much as it says. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.Turned out really good. Nice flavour. I will be making this again especially in the summer when you don't want to turn your oven on but you need a hot meal. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#OMG this is really good and quick! Love being able to make it all in one skillet! I changed a few things up... I used beef stock instead of water. Added some carrots too! I used instant mashed taters and doctored them up with butter! 5 stars
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#2#0#First time making Shepherd's Pie and was a little leery if my husband would like it, since he's not big on mashed potatoes. I did make a change and used frozen mixed vegetables since they were needing to be used up and did not use as much onions. Other wise followed the recipe as follows. It was DELICIOUS and we will enjoy the leftovers as well. Thanks for sharing the recipe...it's a keeper! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#1#I don't agree with the majority of these reviews. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding extra onions and an additional 1/4 cup of sharp cheddar cheese on top--neither of which should detract from the flavor, quite the opposite in fact. I found it rather bland and neither of my two men asked for seconds. Right now my husband is eating a peanut butter & jelly sandwich instead. My son described it as OK. For me it's not to be repeated. Hope I can get someone to eat the leftovers. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#My husband and I absolutely love this recipe!! We are cutting back on carbs now so I tried mashed cauliflower instead of potatoes on top. Still came out yummy!!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#My family and I enjoyed this. It was pretty easy and I always have these ingredients on hand. We will do this again.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#This was a quick and delicious recipe! The flavors blended well. We loved it, and will definately make it again!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#I read the reviews and had to try it myself! Easy and super delicious! Only used 1/2 c. peas and 1/2 c. corn. As a matter of fact, my son and daughter-in-law insisted on taking home the leftovers! Will definitely make again!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#This was VERY good! My husband loved it. Used two cans of mixed veggies that I had on hand and added extra beef broth to make a bit more sauce. Absolutely outstanding. This will be my go-to meal for families that need a meal from church. Other reviews have said it freezes well, so I'm hoping to make up several and have them on hand! Thank you. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Excellent fall comfort food. Because I was in a hurry I used store bought mashed potatoes. I definitely will make this again.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#I made this recipe exactly as written and it was delicious. Very simple too. I served with warm French bread and a salad. Yummy dinner.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#If you add an egg to the potatoes, they wil get crispy golden brown on the top. French fries onion rings during the last 5 minutes. YUMMY.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#Oh my goodness!! This was sooo delicious! It came together really fast, even including the time it took to make the mashed potatoes. I did make double the water/ bullion/ cornstarch mixture and was heavy handed with the worcestershire because I like the filling saucy, and it turned out fabulous! My new favorite shepherds pie recipe!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#Excellent and easy!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#1#I made this tonight for my Mom. She loved it! Whenever she says it's a 5-star keeper , I know she loves it. She even asked for seconds, which is most unusual. Because I didn't have any leftover mashed potatoes, I prepared a full bag of Ore-Ida Steam and Mash Russet potatoes. I used 2 packets of low-sodium beef broth because she's on a low-sodium diet. I used a tad less Worcester sauce, and increased the amount of low-sodium ketchup. but the flavor was still GREAT! Oh, BTW, I loved it too! We will definitely have this again. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#Love love love it!!! Very easy, and I had all ingredients for it... Kids ate it up with minimal talking at the dinner table... A sure sign they enjoyed it! Anything with ketchup and Worcestershire sauce is a hit!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Excellent flavors. I made this in advance, covered with foil, refrigerated until time for dinner. Warmed up at 350 for 15 minutes, uncovered, continued warming for 10 more minutes. I will allow a little longer to warm up next time, but it is still delicious. I think the ketchup gives it just a hint of sweetness. My hubby LOVED it and so did I.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#1#The best thing is the flavor. The second best thing is how fast it is to make! I like how the minimal cooking allowed the frozen vegetables to keep their integrity and flavor. I used mixed vegetables instead of corn and peas only. I also upped the ketchup, W. sauce, and beef bullion granules by half again as much to give it an extra punch of flavor. A keeper!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#I lightened this up with ground turkey, nonfat greek yogurt and then added a cup of green bell pepper, a little crushed red pepper flakes, a good amount of ground black pepper, 2 tsp beef bullion powder, and no worcestershire sauce. It was VERY good and I'll make it again!! GREAT comfort food while not being too damaging!! :) 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Yummy! This is such a great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Yummy! This is such a great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Yummy! This is such a great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#Super easy to make and very hearty on a cold day. Huge hit for the entire family! From youngest to oldest.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#This was a wonderful and quick meal! Other than reducing the onion to 1/2 to suit my families tastes I followed the recipe and it turned out great. I'll certainly be making this one again. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#I thought it was delicious, didn't change a thing, and followed the recipe as written. It is a keeper! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#1#0#This is a quick and delicious dinner all in one pot! Love that! I made a few changes to the recipe to suit my family's tastes and this was a meal they really raved about!!! I substituted a package of frozen mixed veggies (thawed) for the corn and peas. I saw other reviewers substitute beef broth for the granules and boiling water and I did the same. I also only used 1 1/2 tsp. worchestshire, based on reviews. Lastly, I added 1 can of diced tomatoes (drained) to add a bit more flavor....it was delicious, kids and hubby all want it again! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#I can't quite put my finger on why this wasn't my favorite, but I think I would skip the worcestershire sauce and ketchup and just make a beef broth type gravy to mix in - and also I would probably omit the peas, or put in fewer and add in some carrots. It wasn't bad, but not something I would make again, unless I adjusted it more to my tastes. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#I've had different kinds of shephards pie this one was so easy to make and was very tasty had great flavor, the only thing I would change is instead of hamburger meat use corn beef and no onions, this was a great recipe though and will keep it on the list to make again! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#This is a go-to for my family. It's quick, easy, I usually have the ingredients on hand and my kids enjoy it. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#I liked how the whole dish was cooked on the stovetop rather than a mix of stovetop and oven; it was more convenient. I changed a few things: I used beef broth instead of water and bouillon, and I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so I replaced it with BBQ and hot sauce. Past Shepherd's Pie recipes have been extremely bland so I think the BBQ sauce and hot sauce actually made the recipe more enjoyable for us. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Delicious! My husband loves this dish.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#This is really good and simple to make. I served it with a good crusty bread.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#I love cooking this recipe, and my husband loves eating it! I much prefer this stovetop version to my old standby which called for putting it in the oven. The first time I made it was good, but it was missing a little something. I always added a bit of dried tarragon to my old recipe, and so I did with this one as well. Perfect!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Very good recipe. Would make again.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#I do agree with another poster that I might cut the Worcestershire sauce down a bit.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Wonderful recipe! Everyone I serve it to absolutely loves it!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#This was just okay. It's a little bland. I think if I make it again I'll add some tomato paste or something to flavor it up. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#I've made this recipe so many times that I've lost track. The only thing I do different is I use vegetable or beef stock instead of the boullion and boiling water. This one is one of my favorite go-to's! 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#This was a very easy and great tasting recipe. I didn't have frozen vegetables so I used canned corn and green beans. It turned out great. I like it even better the next day. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Husband asks me to make this recipe again and again!!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#This was such an easy and delicious recipe! I would decrease the amount of Worcestershire sauce. I made the topping with half of the pie with the white potatoes and the other half I used mashed sweet potatoes (just salt, pepper, little butter and milk). The sweet potato side went faster than the traditional potato side. Thank you for this recipe!
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Shepherd's pie is one of the simplest, easiest meals to make in a hurry and this one is excellent. My family loves it and we'll be making it many more times. It's a keeper, for sure. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#We really enjoy this comfort food in my home. It is easy to make & cooks up fast. Great one-dish meal that I will make again & again.
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#Use a deep (3 ) skillet for this recipe-otherwise it may overflow! Very tasty comfort food. 
Skillet Shepherd's Pie#0#0#My family LOVES this recipe!!!
Ravioli Lasagna#22#1#I would suggest adding onions and garlic while browning the beef and add the sauce after the beef is cooked, so the beef would be equally spread throughout all the layers. It wouldn't add to the labor and it makes the dish more flavorful. It's an easy recipe and next time I will try with refrigerated ravioli because that's what I have. 
Ravioli Lasagna#5#0#Simple and delicious. It was a fun way to switch up pasta. I thought it was good but I did add a bit of salt and Italian seasoning to the meat as it cooked.
Ravioli Lasagna#8#2#My 8 year old granddaughter enjoys cooking with me. I was looking for a very easy recipe for the two of us to make and this worked well. She loves watching cooking shows on tv and decided we should add more sauce the next time. I think I would also add some garlic and add onions as I brown the beef.
Ravioli Lasagna#5#1#This recipe is in my regular rotation. I like using a pound of Italian sausage, but either way is good. Taste belies the effort.
Ravioli Lasagna#42#31#For what it is it was excellent. It is not lasagna, it is a very good baked ravioli. I used store bought fresh 3 cheese ravioli and a 24 ounce jar of traditional marinara sauce.  I added two large sliced cremini mushrooms, ¼ cup diced sweet onion, 2 diced garlic cloves, substituted country sausage for ground beef and gave it a few good shakes of Italian seasoning. I cut the original recipe in half and we ate half of that giving us another meal sometime in the future. There are just two of us so a little goes along way. Served it with some Italian baguette bread to mop up the bottom of our bowls. 
Ravioli Lasagna#17#9#I've made this a few times, and I always add diced tomatoes, mushrooms, and garlic. And, I substitute the ground beef with seasoned ground turkey. I top it with more mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. One jar of Ragu is enough for me.....but either way, it always comes out good, and beats standing over a stove for HOURS. 
Ravioli Lasagna#13#1#This recipe was easy and delicious. We used cheese ravioli and seasoned the ground beef with a generous amount of herb salt. It was quick and easy. Will definitely make again.
Ravioli Lasagna#9#4#This was delicious and so easy to make. I made half of the recipe using Italian hot sausage. I sauteed onions and bell peppers and added them to the spaghetti sauce (I used the whole jar for 1/2 of the recipe). I added parmesan cheese to the mozzarella and I seasoned with salt and pepper. Will make again.
Ravioli Lasagna#15#2#This was truly delicious and smelled amazing when baking. I made it with ricotta and spinach ravioli and it reminded me of my favorite lasagna. This is a great sub-in when you're craving lasagna but don't want to spend the hours making one from scratch. It was delicious the way it was, but I agree with other commenters that it could use extra sauce. Next time i will add an 8oz can of good quality pizza sauce as well. I will also substitute about a third of the mozzarella for fontina, and add parmesan to the top. And will add an Italian sausage or two to the ground beef. Lots of ways to have fun with this easy recipe! Thanks, this was a comfort food winner! 
Ravioli Lasagna#18#1#Do you have to boil the frozen ravioli first or do you just layer it frozen? this sounds so good
Ravioli Lasagna#4#1#This went together super easily and was very good. I think maybe I would use a bit more spaghetti sauce or maybe I used a few too many raviolis! I did not use the basil. I will make this again for sure
Ravioli Lasagna#7#0#Tasted just like lasagna, but so much easier to make. I used a spinach and ricotta ravioli and thought this tasted great. Next time I make it, I'm going to use Italian sausage instead of the ground beef. 
Ravioli Lasagna#8#0#I made this last night (exactly as written) to take to an Italian Night potluck. It was so good and so easy, I'll definitely be making this recipe again. One lady even asked me for the recipe! 
Ravioli Lasagna#1#1#Husband loved it, but I had no cheese ravioli so I used chicken and cheese ravioli and mixed in the sauce some chopped sliced pepperoni and topped with mozzarella cheese, (he loves pepperoni) next time I will try it the way it is written!
Ravioli Lasagna#8#2#Have made it many times for company. Use my own sauce and a certain brand of ravioli from Publix, called Parla. These ravioli taste like homemade (no garbage ingredients) and make a big difference in the outcome of your meal.
Ravioli Lasagna#1#0#The first time I made it it was a little dry since there is not much sauce. I then added a 2nd 28oz jar and it came out perfect. Very good.
Ravioli Lasagna#1#3#Thank you for sharing this recipe, I'm so glad I saw it and tried it!! I made it for our Sunday dinner. It is simple to make, but delicious, and tastes like you spent hours. What a win-win! Everything about it was perfect, and best of all my husband was very complimentary!! We will definitely add this to our dinner line-up!!!!
Ravioli Lasagna#3#0#This recipe is SO easy and SO delicious! I added one diced onion and two cloves of garlic to the ground beef for extra flavour, and used semi-cooked ravioli instead of frozen. Worked great and the husband loved it too!
Ravioli Lasagna#2#0#So easy and such a great warm and cozy week night meal. My husband can be kind of picky but he really liked this. I definitely will be making this again and I already have friends asking for my recipe.
Ravioli Lasagna#4#4#So delicious and easy. I am making it again this week. Using cheese ravioli takes away the need to go shopping for ricotta. I can make it any time. Used Rao marinara.
Ravioli Lasagna#2#2#Love this quick version of lasanga... great taste and now in the dinner rotation!
Ravioli Lasagna#0#1#Can't read recipe - please remove advertisement so I can make this wonderful recipe.
Ravioli Lasagna#4#2#Super easy recipe and great for getting kids in the kitchen! We added a little onion and garlic to the ground beef mixture and some crushed tomatoes to make a little extra sauce. Love how the ravioli goes into the casserole frozen and bakes up beautifully. My grandson loves to cook and made this recipe under my supervision. Everyone loved it and we'll definitely make it again. Perfect for weeknights! 
Ravioli Lasagna#3#3#This was fantastic! I used one pound of ground beef and one pound of spicy Italian sausage (and added some Italian seasoning & garlic salt to the meat mixture), two jars of Newman's Marinara sauce and two bags of small round cheese raviolis. For the first layer of cheese, I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and mixed ricotta, an egg, basil, and I added Parmesan and Mozzarella to the mix. I used a 13x9 glass pan, baked it about 50 minutes, then took the foil off and baked it another 10 minutes. We had guests for dinner and everyone loved it.
Ravioli Lasagna#3#1#Made this for dinner last night and we both loved it. I did dress it up a little by adding an egg combined with about 6 oz of ricotta, then mixed half the mozz into this. Spread this mixture on top of each layer before adding final layer of sauce, mozz and about 1/4 cup of Parm. Left the ravioli frozen and used the jarred sauce that starts with R and ends with s. Dish came out perfect - not watery at all. I like that it was enough for dinner one night and lunch another day. Will definitely make this again.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#I followed the recipe
Ravioli Lasagna#3#11#This was just ok. The sauce was watery from the frozen raviolis and they were doughy. My husband who loves lasagna couldn't eat this. I reheated the next day and the sauce was less watery and the taste was slightly improved but I will not be making this again.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#2#I made this last night. Someone else went to the store for me and picked up both ravioli and tortellini. I used Italian sausage browned with an onion. The ravioli went on the bottom and the tortellini on the top layer. Since I cannot stand the taste of jarred spaghetti sauce: I used a refrigerated one, Buitoni. I have found that their marinara sauce to be the closest to homemade. When I served it the ravioli was too chewy and flavorless. I will go with all tortellini next time. My dinner was a ht.
Ravioli Lasagna#1#1#Sorry..but I am not seeing where in the recipe the half. N half is added and the amt that Martha is speaking about.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#This was tasty and easy, but not awesome. I followed recipe exactly first time, It was okay. 2nd time I substituted mild pork sausage for hamburger, full cream for half and half, and added dried minced parsley in filling and on top - much better. Next time I will add minced, sautéed mushrooms and a bit more Italian seasoning. Easy, and everyone liked it.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#What if I only have fresh ravioli not frozen
Ravioli Lasagna#1#0#so this is just a layed baked raviol
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#I made a homemade spaghetti sauce and then followed the recipe. I used four cheese mini ravioli and made three layers. In addition to the mozzarella, I sprinkled a little grated reggi parm on the top. I love this recipe.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Easy to put together, and guests have loved this.
Ravioli Lasagna#1#0#Do the ravioli need to be cooked before or just to use them frozen?
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#We enjoyed this recipe tonight. I made no changes except to make a smaller amount for the two of us. It is delicious and we cleaned our plates. Quick, easy, and delicious. Volunteer Field Editor
Ravioli Lasagna#1#0#Excellent and SO easy! I did use some little half moon shaped raviolis that have a lot more cheese in them than your standard frozen ravioli but that is the only thing I did differently. I might've added a little extra Mozzarella cheese to but that didn't change the fact that this is a wonderful and very satisfying dish. I am planning to make this for Christmas Eve dinner! Yum YUM!! 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Very easy and satisfying.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#I added Garlic ,Salt and pepper along with ITALIAN seasoning but the dish as a whole was big hit.
Ravioli Lasagna#1#0#This recipe was so super simple with only three ingredients that most people will have on hand. My daughter isn't much of a ravioli fan but she loved this recipe. I am totally adding this to our weeknight rotations. Comes together in a snap. 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#I made this very easy-to-make recipe for dinner last night. It was delicious! The only thing I changed was to add a 14.5 ounce can of petite diced tomatoes to the spaghetti sauce because I like my lasagne to be saucy . Also, I used a 13X9-inch glass baking dish which worked well. If you're looking for a quick and easy.... and HEARTY meal, this is the recipe for you! 5 stars!!! Volunteer Field Editor 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Very easy dinner to make.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Very easy to make and tasted good
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#100% home run! I took the advice, of previous reviews, to increase the amount of cheese and meat. I also followed the advice to use Italian sausage instead of ground beef (more flavor). Next time, I would also increase the amount of ravioli.....I used a chicken-spinach ravioli! I think a person could put a latin spin on the recipe and use salsa instead of spaghetti sauce.
Ravioli Lasagna#1#2#This was very good and VERY easy. I did substitute Italian sausage as many suggested and I agree that the finished product would have been way too bland with just ground beef. My only thought on this recipe is that ravioli pasta is much thicker than sheets of lasagna so add more meat and cheese to compensate. 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#I made this over 20 years ago for my kids. I would put the ravioli in individual ramekins and freeze. When they got home from school just take a ramekin from the freezer and bake. Great little pick-pick-me-up before after school activities began. This is also good with cheese ravioli, leftover chicken, and alfredo sauce.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#I didn't really care for this, but I am also not a big tomato sauce fan. It certainly didn't live up to its' hype. I used half ground beef and half sausage, with cheese ravioli. I might try it again with extra cheeses and spices, but then again, I might not bother.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#This recipe is so inspiring and easy, you don't even need to boil the ravioli, just bake as the recipe directs. I make my own sauce but any favorite will do. Try pepperoni and prepared pizza sauce for a meal the kids will love. It's one of those quick, can't fail, everyone loves recipes. 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#This was really good, and simple! I made this camping (oven in trailer), and I don't normally do anything too complex due to size/room constraints. Will definitely make again, but will use Italian sausage instead of hamburger. 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#I have no idea how a recipe with so few ingredients tastes so good! And it's so easy too! Absolutely delicious! I used an Italian sausage ravioli to give it a little extra kick. 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Dish is good, just wish I would have added more meat and sauce to the dish. A pound is just not enough for this dish in my opinion. Also next time I may add sausage to it as well.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#So easy and sooooooo good!
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#A good and fast dish to make. I took it to church for a fast meal and it was well received. Will make again.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Good recipe- kids loved it. It's a keeper.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#I added cottage cheese (or ricotta, if you prefer) and Parmesan cheese. I found that the ravioli dough is much thicker than lasagna noodles, and it cooked a lot slower than I thought it would! It also needed MUCH MORE sauce than the recipe indicated, as you are cooking it in the sauce! Next time, I will cook them in water first, then drain and continue with recipe!!
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#good and easy recipe
Ravioli Lasagna#1#0#Made this and it's fabulous... Now I need to double the recipe... Has anybody doubled it??? If so what size casserole did you use??? Plus how long did you need to bake it??? Or would you recommend make two casseroles??? Thank You... 
Ravioli Lasagna#1#0#I made this dish tonight for dinner and it was a hit. I used mild Italian sausage instead of ground beef. Used sharp cheddar and Parmesan cheese and beef ravioli. I also added onion and garlic to the sauce. This will be a dish we have once a month for dinner. Love it!
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Super easy and delicious.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#I have to say that I really liked this Ravioli Lasagna. I used cheese and spinach ravioli and added my typical Italian spices to the sauce, onion/green pepper/garlic/mushrooms with the browning ground beef. Because I wanted to make certain that it wouldn't be dry, I made 1 1/2 times the sauce. It was so much easier than the typical lasagna, but again, it isn't the typical lasagna. I will still make classic lasagna, it has it's own attributes. 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Will definitely make again. I used sausage ravioli and spaghetti sauce with garlic. Wonderful flavor and so easy. Delicious.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Good
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Great recipe. Easy to put together and flavor was wonderful. Will make again.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Quick, easy and yummy. This recipe turns out just the way it's supposed to. 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Admission - I didn't use any meat when I made my version. But, it was really good and well received with my picky eaters. I used cheese ravioli and it was saucier than I'm sure it would have been with meat, but it was delish! Super quick and easy to put together. Will def make again!! 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#So easy to make and delicious. Perfect weeknight cooking.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Awesome recipe! Delicious and definitely a keeper!
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#I was really surprised that this dish was not runny with using frozen ravioli. This was so easy and delishious. I used mild Italian sausage, its what I had on hand and a little extra Italian seasoning to our liking. Thank you for sharing, will be making this more often.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#This Recipe was really good. I wouldn't change a thing. Although if I wished. I could add a little more spice. Real easy to make. 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Perfect recipe for busy week night. Delicious and Easy describes this dish!
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#This recipe is a winner! Is so easy, delicious and lends itself to customize to your family's taste. I added the meat with the sauce and also some chopped red pepper, onion and Italian seasoning. I used cheese ravioli. I used about 1.5 jars of sauce because we like our pasta pretty saucy and the picture did not seem to be but I don't think it was actually necessary. I will make this again and again and tweak the recipe according to what I have on hand and who I am serving. 
Ravioli Lasagna#1#0#I was skeptical anything this easy would be good, but tried it as an option to freeze and send to my grad school son. I made as directed, except since I cook a lot and had much on hand, I added garlic and onion powder, Worcestershire, sugar, fresh basil and oregano to the sauce, as I had that on hand. Really whatever you do to jarred sauce or nothing would work. I used cheese ravioli and 90% lean ground beaf. I also threw in about 1/4 cup of parmesan with the mozzarella because I had it. This was really good for what could be a 4 ingredient recipe.This could be adapted so many ways, but it is surprisingly good for such a simple recipe!
Ravioli Lasagna#1#0#I love how easy and delicious this meal was!! I used a mix of sausage and beef, and jar sauce, however, I used a jar and a half of sauce. I love how versatile this dish is. If I had my homemade sauce or meat sauce on hand I would use that. I think it would also be good with chicken!!
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#This is a great weeknight dinner that is quick easy when you keep everything on hand to make it. Freezes great, too!
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Quick, easy and good. Will try adding some sausage next time. Great recipe.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#This dish is easy and quick to assemble. My family loved it and it makes enough to feed six of us (this includes 4 hungry teenagers!) it's nice to use frozen ravioli since you can have a couple of bags stashed in freezer at all times! Thanks for sharing! 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Super easy and really tasty. I used pepperoni instead of beef. Easy to adapt with different meat and different ravioli fillings. This will be a regular!
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#This was so good. I used a olive oil and garlic sauce and Italian sausage. These gave it all the flavor it needed. I used the cheese Raviolis which I think would be what this dish needs. We just couldn't stop eating it. This is going to be on my table a lot. Thank you for this wonderful recipe. 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Really easy. Love. Virtually no cleanup. Love more. I added some seasonings and such to the sauce but just to spice things up. Good concept but we were disappointed overall. Think it was the frozen cheese ravioli. Not a big selection in our region for frozen pasta. Think I'll try a chicken artichoke alfredo version next time and use a refrigerated pasta instead of frozen. Also will cut the recipe in half for the two of us. Not bad though! Will keep working at it. 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Great idea I'm glad I tried it. My modification: I used different types of ravioli flavors from Trader Joes for each layer. One layer cheese and spinach ravioli then sauce and cheese, next layer mushroom and cheese ravioli, sauce and cheese, etc.... I used about 4 different types (all vegetarian for my son ) and family loved it! For the meat eaters I poured TJ's turkey bolognese sauce and sprinkled Parmesan cheese over the top of individual portion before serving. 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Really good and really easy. Will try with Italian sausage next time to spice it up a little. My three year old and five year old loved it.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#This recipe was fast and easy! I did half ground beef, and half no meat (for my daughter) Needless to say it's just about gone. I used spinach & cheese ravioli's. Great Recipe! Very easy! 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Made this the first time and it turned out delicious. It was very simple to make and prepare. Definitely will add this to my repitoire. Thanks again for another great and simple recipe.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Amazingly good for so simple ingredients and much better than plain ravioli and sauce.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Simply fantastic. Used Italian sausage instead of ground beef. Too easy.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Where can you buy the Frozen Cheese Ravioli ? 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Absolutely FANTASTIC! This recipe is so versatile that can be altered with different ingredients according to ones liking. I made it for dinner last night & my husband kept on raving about it. Here are my changes, used ground turkey (dietary restrictions) instead of beef, portobello mushroom ravioli & low fat shredded Italian blend cheese, little Romano cheese, Tuscan herb mixture. Cooked the ground turkey then added the pasta sauce to it in the same pot. Followed the recipe from there & sprinkled 2 tablespoons of grated Romano cheese on top. I made this yesterday morning and left it in the fridge, brought it to room temp. 2 hours before baking. Frankly, I rather make this than lasagna, since its easier, lighter & tastier. Patricia, thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe. This is a keeper in my recipe file.
Ravioli Lasagna#3#0#I agree with Southern Master. Seems like lately a lot of people who haven't made the recipes are just using the recipes as soap boxes to trash the salt content and not rate the recipe. Go to low or no salt recipe websites and let the people who want to try the recipes do it. 
Ravioli Lasagna#2#0#@ botanner: First, if you're going to review a recipe that you haven't tried, have the decency to give it four or five stars so it doesn't lower the overall rating. Second, just about all Italian recipes can be high in sodium, so what's your point? Third, incredible amount of salt?? There are cheese ravioli brands that aren't high in sodium per serving, ditto for spaghetti sauce. Or make your own sauce! I have to watch my sodium, but I'll make this dish, maybe with adjustments, maybe not! 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#This was easy to make while on vacation. Didn't take any pantry ingredients, which was great since we stayed in a place that had nothing but the pans provided. It was enjoyed by everyone. 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Easy to put together, tastes like it took you forever. It was a great crowd pleaser.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Boiled ravioli first (and reduced baking time to 20 mins). Swapped ground Italian sausage for ground beef. Added a pinch of brown sugar and 2t Italian seasoning to sauce. Would be great to double and freeze.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#I've also made this using pierogies. Layering them like lasagna noodles. You can even make this meatless for a Lenten meal. 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#This was very good. Definitely make this again! The only modification I made to the recipe was I used a small amount of ground beef.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Can you use fresh ravioli? Or do you have to cook it first?
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#This was SO delicious! I ended up having leftover frozen ravioli so I followed the recipe and reduced the amounts. I fit it into one of my special pots that is oven-safe, and my husband loved it! I'd forgotten to cover it before baking, and he was thrilled with the results: nice'n' brown cheese on top! 
Ravioli Lasagna#1#0#Easy Peasy!! I did add additional sauce.....we like our pasta throughly covered.....and practically swimming in sauce!
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Simple and quite delicious. Made it as written, but added some chopped onion and garlic to ground meat when browning. Great comfort food.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#This was a quick and delicious recipe. I used Italian sausage instead of hamburger to give it more flavor.
Ravioli Lasagna#1#0#Thank you for posting this recipe - it's simplicity and cost-effectiveness makes it excellentfollowed steps of recipe exactly - doubled ingredients to feed our larger family of 9 (7 kids) - changed meat to 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground hot sausage - also changed Spaghetti Sauce to cans of Pastene Kitchen Ready Ground Tomatoes - debated changing cheese to Italian Blend or adding Italian Seasonings but decided against it for 1st time - sometimes it's simplicity of recipes that make them delicious - don't want to ruin recipe by overpowering itDid use 4 cup bag of Shredded Mozzarella Cheese, which is more than double - also sprayed pan (to grease it) & underside of foil used to cover pan with Bertolli Extra Light Tasting Olive Oil SprayGreat suggestions by all reviewers :) 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Very easy and a big hit. I used Rosetto cheese ravioli and was very pleased with the results.
Ravioli Lasagna#1#0#This is absolutely delicious. Our kids loved it. It is so simple and easy, and perfect for a fast dinner, or potluck. I used an Italian Spaghetti sauce, and for ravioli, I used frozen 4 cheese ravioli and a package of frozen spinach and cheese ravioli, and it was a winning combination of ravioli. I used a little more mozzarella than called for as our family likes cheese. You won't be disappointed! 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#I made this for dinner last night and it was awesome! I added some fresh parmesan and provolone slices to the top. The entire family loved it!
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#I made this for a mercy meal, and it disappeared almost at once. Easy to make, for sure. I used spinach and cheese ravioli, and instead of a jar of sauce, I used my own roasted veggie sauce. Definitely a keeper!
Ravioli Lasagna#1#0#We have 6 people in our family, and there is always one that complains every night about what we eat for supper. But not tonight. The family absolutely loved this!!! I tweeked the recipe a little bit. I used a bigger pan and i used one whole jar of sauce on the bottom, then layered the frozen bag of ravioli on top off sauce and pushed down into the sauce then layered the hamburger on ravioli. Poured another jar of sauce all over the layers. Used the whole 2 cup bag of cheese, plus a little bit more, which made a nice layer over everything. To top it off, I covered the shredded cheese with single layer of pepperoni. Cooked 45 minutes at 400, and served. Before supper was over, everyone wanted to know when we could have this meal again.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#If you like lasagna you will like this and it is fast and easy.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Thanks,More like a ravioli casserole.Layered frozen,heat n serve meatballs cut in half,instead of the beef.Pepperoni under the top layer of 4 cheese Italian blend.Dont forget the parmesan,Texas toast to sop up the sauce.10 minute prep.One dish cleanup.Cant get any easier than this.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Easy to put together and the kids loved it.
Ravioli Lasagna#1#0#My family ABSOLUTELY loves this dish. Doubled up on the recipe and made 2 trays as I have a home with 4 hungry males. They love this Can't go wrong dish . Easy and a great comfort food dish. Highly recommend. You won't be disappointed. A keeper!! Add a side salad and garlic bread and you have a home run 
Ravioli Lasagna#1#0#Very easy to make, will make again, I used beef ravioli .
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Winner, winner * Just made this one earlier in the week. I skipped the meat and let me tell you it was wonderful. Gooey cheesy Good * Super quick and easy. No fuss, no mess just lots of good eats * A Keeper.Janie
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#After reading the reviews, I really thought that when the dish cooked and then set, it would cut more like a lasagna. When plated, it fell apart. It was tasty and was received well enough from my family, but nothing very memorable. I appreciated the ease of the recipe and would make again though.

Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#thank you this sounds really yummy can't wait to try it I'm sure the family will love it 
Ravioli Lasagna#2#0#Very easy and good. Motleygirl123 no cooking ravioli. It cooks in the sauce in the oven. If it doesn't say to cook it don't. If you precook it the pasta will beswollen and overdone chewy. Not a stupid question at all. I learned from experience!! :-) 
Ravioli Lasagna#1#0#Can I ask a stupid question? do you cook the Ravioli first?
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Just made this for dinner! So easy to make and the kids loved it! They said it was a keeper 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#This is so easy to make and my family just loved it. Terri Ann
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Very quick to put together and tasted really good. Will certainly make again.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#When I found this recipe I knew I had to make it. Now I did switch it up a little bit using Italian Sausage instead of hamburger, also didn't have the spaghetti sauce that I needed to make it, but to make what the recipe called for I used Alfredo Sauce an substituted the cheese for a mix of Provel, and Mozzarella cheese. This made it very creamy and had extra sause for it which is what I like. Overall very good recipe and I will definately be making this again 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#I thought this was very good and tasted much like the more hard to prepare lasagna. I added italian seasoning to the ground turkey and added sliced provolone cheese in between the ravioli layers with italian mix cheese on top. My husband and son were less excited about it than I was but I thought that was because they don't do the cooking and so they don't know the time and effort that goes into making'real' lasagna!! 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Used 2% cheese to cut down on cal & fat. Will use finely shredded next time.
Ravioli Lasagna#1#0#I have made this several times in the past few months since I first spotted this recipe online. I have jazzed it up a bit since I first tried it. The first time I made it strictly by the book...,Ned while it was good, I felt like it was lacking something. Taking my own cue for the traditional lasagna I typically make, the next time I made this I added some chopped onion and baby portabella mushrooms, and I used one package of ground beef plus I added one pound of bulk Italian sausage. Once thry were all cooked together, I layered the ravioli ( cheese only) the sauce, the mozarela cheese, plus I also added a package of provolone cheese slices, divided, and I topped twitch one half a jar of Alfredo sauce. I then repeated the ayers , endings with the red sauce and cheese, and baked as directed. It' is a lot easier than putting the traditional lasagna recipe together. I have served this to several friends, and they all love it! Thanks for posting the original recipe, which has since morphed into my new favorite lasagna recipe! 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#I honestly didn't think something this easy could turn out so ridiculously rich and delicious. It's cheesy, indulgent, gooey, comfort food taken to the tenth power.I made two pans, one using Italian sausage (that I seasoned with onions and Italian spices) for a carnivore friend and a meatless version for myself. Both were wonderful and garnered big thumbs up!! Thanks to the other reviewers for suggesting sausage instead of beef, it really added richness to the dish.Other minor changes: I used two types of ravioli: cheese and portabella-cheese. I used one jar of marinara and one jar of vodka sauce and a shredded blend of mozzarella, parmesan, and romano.As far as steps, I followed them exactly, and it was easy as pie (and as tasty!). I couldn't believe how great both pans looked when I pulled them out of the oven, or how good the kitchen smelled. A keeper for sure!! 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#OOPS! 5 plus stars...
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Quick and so good, I kicked it up a notch, starting with a meat sauce, then the cheese ravioli, topped with Land of lakes New 4 cheese blend american style slices, grated mozzarela, sauce,a layer of italian sausage crumbled and cooked, sprinkled with italian seasoning, then a layer of beef ravioli. Topped with the same cheese layeres as above, then another layer of cheese raviloi.Another layer of sauce, grated parm then more italian cheese blend. I also added a extra cup of water to the sauce to ensure that the pasta cooks well. It really doesn't look like it is too thin of a sauce, but it does hlp. This filled my lasagna pan which is larger than a 9x13. Feeds an army.. I put this together the day before I wanted it. and took it out of the fridge about an hour before putting it in my 400 degree oven. I covered it for the first 30 mins with foil sprayed with pam olive oil. Uncovered it and let it brown a little. PLEASE LET IT SIT FOR 15 MINS OR SO TO SET UP. MANGA MANGA! 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#This is very good and extremely simple. I added garlic powder to the beef and used the cheese ravioli. It was delicious. The second time I made this, I did a mixture of beef and Italian sausage and the cheese ravioli with extra cheese and it was fantastic. The third time, I tried the recipe with the sausage ravioli but I think you need the cheese ravioli to accomplish the lasagna taste/effect. We did not like that one nearly as much.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#My husband loved this I made it with the sausage instead of hamburger and he just raved about it. He asked when are we having that again. Thank you very much.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#We used the ground beef (would be even better with sausage) and added onions, garlic, mushrooms, dried parsley, rosemary and thyme. This dish is easy and hearty! Will make it again this winter (using sausage this time!).
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Great with ground turkey and spinach ravioli for something a little less fatty but just as delicious!
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Good & easy. I cooked onions with the ground beef & added spinach. Everyone enjoyed
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Yummy! I used beef ravioli and used Italian sausage instead of ground beef. Added onion and mushrooms to the meat as I was frying it. Doubled the sauce and used a 3c package of cheese. Definitely a keeper!
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Good, easy, cheap, and quick! All good things! Added mushrooms, artichoke hearts and lots more cheese mmm good!
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Served this recipe to a friend for her 97th Birthday. Everyone loved it.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#for as quick as it was to prepare it was gone even faster! a favorite in our house
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#This was so easy and so good! I used an 11x7 casserole, 8 oz mozzarella cheese and non-frozen cheese ravioli. I did cook the ravioli for about 7 minutes before combining in the casserole. This made six servings, so I had two meals to freeze for later. Am anxious to serve this to guests.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#a very easy reipe, and very tasty. everyone loved it.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#I added more cheese and italian sausage with the groundbeef. It was very easy to make and all my kids said it was good to eat . 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Really easy to make. I added mushrooms to mine, and I used soy ground beef (vegetarian), and it turned out well. Nothing too exciting, but easy and cheap! Can't go wrong there! 
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#I make something simular using beef ravioli and no other meat
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#Mmmmm....needs more cheese tho...wonderful, cheap and quick.
Ravioli Lasagna#0#0#this is a great recipe idea.I make my own sauce instead.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Is there anyway to make without using sour cream as I am lactose intolerant?
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Just noticed a mistake in my review of Mar. 20 2020--I apparaently mistyped--it should have been 1 tsp to 1 cup of water in reply to another person's review about that item. Sorry. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#1#Like others, I added diced onion, carrot and celery. I also used homemade broth and decreased the sour cream, using a generous half cup. I also used frozen home style egg noodles. We LOVED it! 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#7#8#This soup was so good. Me and the kids loved it! This recipe is a keeper. I did make some modifications based on other people's comments. One: I added sautéed onions, carrots, celery, and garlic to the soup. Two: Instead of the cream of chicken soup I added cream of chicken soup with herbs. Three: I omitted the sour cream as my family doesn't like sour cream. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#6#3#Comforting is the perfect title for this noodle soup. Super fast and very good. I used up some frozen egg noodles I had and it almost tasted homemade. Kids loved it because no veggies: they don't count the carrot and celery sticks I served on the side. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#This was quick and easy and my whole family enjoyed it.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#4#1#We love this soup!!! The only change I've made is using chicken broth rather than bouillon. I frequently increase the liquid ingredients and add mixed vegetables. Either way it's delicious! 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#5#4#I ended up using rotisserie chicken and cooked it in an instant pot with a little onion powder and 16 ounces of frozen mixed vegetables. It turned out terrific and even my picky children liked the soup. I will say that it needs to be cooked in a larger instant pot as it ran over in my 6 quart instant pot (14 minutes with instant release). I put the sour cream in at the end before serving. But I will make this again.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#12#1#This soup turned out great! I added carrots, celery, onion, peas, minced garlic basil , dried parsley flakes and cheese. Taste wonderful!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#26#5#This is a really good soup. Before I added the sour cream at the end I tasted it. It's good to eat with or without the addition of the sour cream. Homemade cream of chicken soup was used to replace the canned version in my soup. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#48#7#This is my absolute favorite chicken noodle soup and ever since I made it a couple years ago Ive never made another chicken soup recipe. This one is too good to pass up. I do add some onions, celery and carrots because I like the veggies in the soup so much and I prefer to add a big spoonful of sour crean to each serving in the bowl rather than adding it to the pot. That way when I heat up the leftovers, the sour cream wont break. This is just beyond delicious and super easy too!!!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#31#9#I recently made this following the instructions. The soup was creamy, thick and full of chicken flavor. For the two of us, this made enough for a nice dinner, and with the left over, lunch for a another day or two. After reading other variations on this recipe, I will be trying them as well. This is an easy soup and with substance for the person who needs more than just soup . 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#39#16#You will not regret making this soup! I made this one Saturday morning while my son slept off a fever. I figured it would be just what he needed when he woke up! I only made half a batch and I immediately regretted my decision. Like some other reviewers, I sautéed carrot, onion and garlic in olive oil, then removed from the stock pot and started the recipe as written. I also substituted chicken broth for the water and bouillon, added the carrot mixture when I added the chicken, and added some salt and pepper. It was delicious and definitely a comfort food during an arctic plunge in our region! My son snarfed it down when he got up! I will be adding this to my go-to recipe collection! VERY GOOD!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#11#2#I like sour cream but I think 1 cup is too much. My batch tasted more like sour cream noodles than like chicken noodle soup.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#0#Made this tonight! So delicious.....just added some carrots. Yummy!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#20#15#I'm a souper foodie. They call me the soup Queen. I woke up at 2:30am CST and was browsing Instagram why? Because why not. There's a plethora of fun stuff to learn. I came across this recipe and it was just what my soul was after. I read the list of ingredients and low and behold I had everything. Can I get a whoop whoop. I used cream of celery soup ( because I like the layer of flavor it adds) I too added 1C diced celery and shredded carrots. I didn't have sour cream ( who ate my sour cream?) but I did have 1/2 block cream cheese oh yeah you heard me right. It'll be ready shortly. I'm drooling. Thanks so much for posting this recipe. Souped easy and delicious.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#0#Great soup!! We will definitely be making this again.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#2#0#This recipe is quick, easy and oh so delicious! Everyone I have made it for has loved it!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#4#6#I recently made this soup for my neighbors who were ill. It couldn't have been easier. The creamy goodness made both of our households very happy. I added carrots and celery to the soup to up the nutritional value and make for a heartier meal. This is going on our regular rotations of soups this winter. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#8#4#I have used recipes on Taste of Home for years and never left a review before now. THIS SOUP IS AMAZING!! I made it exactly as written and my large family LOVED it! I used leftover grilled chicken, FF sour cream, and lowfat cream of chicken soup. Absolutely amazing. Will make again....and again...and again! I may add saute'd onion and celery next time, but it was wonderful as is! 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#2#3#Very tasty and easy to make. I added 3 bay leaves in it after adding the can of cream of chicken soup and simmered it for 20 minutes while my buns cooked.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#0#One of my favorite soups!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#6#0#I halved the recipe and added diced onions, celery and carrots. I used a box of chicken broth instead of bullion. It is delicious!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#0#Every time I makes this soup, everyone wants some. It's easy to make and tastewonderful 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#2#1#Sounds great to me. To the reviewers who questioned the amount of water--Remember a teaspoon of bouillon to 12 cup of water. Then you also have 2 cans of soup. Seems like some people may want MORE water, not less. Looking forward to always making same as recipe (
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Great soup! Its not watery- as it sits it gets thicker. I did add some chopped onion, celery and carrots.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Love this. Have made it several times. Can change yt? Toe of soup used and add in some veggies. We love it.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#1#That's a lot of water. I'm by myself. Does anyone have suggestions for half that. Seems it wold be very watery. Thanks.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#This soup was so good!! So rich and creamy. A quick meal that gives an all day comfort food feel! We were licking our bowls clean.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#5#Love love love this recipe! I do sauté my chicken remove from pan. Sauté garlic onion for about 1 minute then add celery and carrots until tender then I follow the recipe exactly after that. Well I guess Sometimes I add a little more water depending on my mood and sometimes I add more noodles and serve it over mashed potatoes. Regardless such a great recipe.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#3#4#This was so easy and everyone thought it was fantastic. I did change a few things. Instead of water and chicken bouillon I added 2 - 32 oz. boxes of organic chicken broth, I also sauteed diced onion, carrots, celery, and garlic and used rotisserie chicken. I did not add the sour cream either. We will be making this again.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#This was super easy to make and it tasted great. The recipe makes a lot so I'd recommend halting it unless you have a large family.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#3#4#I made this soup according to directions. It was quick and easy to make with ready made soup and bouillon. While it tasted good it is bland. Next time I will make my own cream of chicken soup and add onions, celery, carrots, garlic, salt and pepper to enhance the flavors.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#This is exactly the same recipe that my husband's grandma used. Apparently it was a special Halloween after-trick-or-treat meal served over mashed potatoes. I love it on it's own, and we make it a lot more frequently than once a year! It's my favorite chicken noodle soup recipe. We've also subbed turkey or rabbit in for the chicken, and it's just as delicious. We've also added other vegetables, like onions, carrots, and peas. But the base recipe is still fantastic all on its own. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Excellent! Definitely will make this again!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#I just made it. Absolutely delicious.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Made this for dinner tonight. Pretty tasty. I read other comments that it came out too think so I I used water and chicken broth, only added 1 can of soup and a 1/2 cup sour cream. Also added carrots and onion.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#4#0#Caught chicken on sale so I made this for lunch today. It was creamy and delicious and so easy to make. Instead of the bouillon I used the broth I boiled my chicken in.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#4#2#This is a keeper! because we can do so much with it. I added carrots, peas, celery salt and a bit of garlic, SO good. Next time I will use red potatoes instead of noodles. Another time I plan on throwing in some zucchini (no carrots, etc.). Thanks so much for this recipe!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#This is a family favorite. It's sooo good, everytime. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#So so good!!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#1#I love Chicken Noodle Soup and was anxious to try this recipie. I should not have added the sour cream. I could not eat the soup because adding the the sour cream made it sour tasting. I love sour cream but not in soup.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#So glad we tried this recipe...the flavor is so yummy and comforting. We added the sour cream, as well as a dash of garlic powder and some minced onions. We used precooked, pre-sliced chicken strips to make the dish even faster. I would like to add sliced celery, carrots and onions and will next time. A great dish, especially during the colder months. Thanks for posting!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Outstanding
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#What a tasty and simple recipe. This is comfort food at it's best for the cold weather! 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#My family really enjoyed this soup. It is so easy to prepare. Next time I will add fewer noodles and throw in some carrots and celery.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#This gets five stars for ease of preparation and common ingredients. It has been a staple in our home for years...ever since it was first published. I often add a can or two of chopped green chiles to give it a little oomph. It is comfort food of the highest order.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Used Chicken stock. Added carrots, celery and onion. Seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before cooking it. Cooked 4 cups of noodles separately. The soup is bland, but indeed comforting.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#My husband who claims not to like chicken soup had seconds. That Iis not bad! I was glad to get something so easily likeable and easy to tailor.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#1#I've made this several times.......and have been told it's the best chicken soup they've ever had !! I don't even bother with the sour cream. It's tasty without it. I do saut? celery and onions and use chicken broth instead of the bouillon and always use rotisserie chicken. It's excellent !!! Yes, the noodles soak up the liquid, so you may want to add a little broth, if you like it soupier.Otherwise, it's sooooo good! Thank you for posting. It's an easy and quick dinner and I love that people rave about it. : ) 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#This is very good, my family enjoyed it. It wasn't very soup like though, so I added more stock because it was thick. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#0#Love this soup. I am teaching my son to cook and he said he wanted to make a chicken noodle soup. I picked this for it's simplicity. It was great!! Next time I will add some veggies, but this was a perfect soup to teach an eight year old to cook. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#2#1#I thought the soup was delicious! I don't usually make a cream based soup for chicken noodle but the sour cream was a great addition! I also thought 6 1/2 cups of noodles were too many. I used a full four cups and it was still a lot of noodles. I only added one can of soup just didn't think it needed two. Sprinkled a little more bouillon in it, added three carrots, a couple of stalks of celery, and about a cup of chopped kale for color and because I have lots in my garden! I also just cooked my cubed chicken and vegetables in the broth a few minutes before I added the noodles. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Delicious and easy! My family all loved it.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Great recipe, wonderful comforting taste. In a couple of the comments that I read it was said that this was more like a stroganoff than a soup. The solution is just use less noodles, I only used 4 cups.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Wonderful soup...fills you up and the family love this recipe. Keep up the good work.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Quick, easy, and amazing! When I make it though it is less like a soup and more like a stroganoff, but it is still so good!!!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#My friend made this soup for us for dinner, and I LOVED it! but, it is not really a soup, its more like a dinner. but, I loved this recipe! 5 stars!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Even better than I expected and so easy to make!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#0#I took this to a potluck yesterday and received many compliments. I, too, added carrots ( 1 can, drained, cut up a little in the can before adding to soup) and finely diced onion and celery (cooked in broth until soft the night before while I was cutting up the chicken). I agree that maybe 4 cups of noodles would have been plenty. Gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because all those noodles soaked up all the broth while it was on low in the crock pot during the party ,even with my adding lots of extra broth! It was so good, I will make it again but with less noodles and not for a long-standing-time event.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#1#This was more like a casserole. Maybe I used to many noodles. No one I served it to liked it.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#This is so easy! My kids loved it! It was even good leftover. The noodles didn't get soggy in the creamy soup like they do in broth. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#1#I am eating this right now and it is so yummy. The perfect soup for a snowy day. I halved the recipe, but I like my soup with more broth so I used six cups water and six tsps bouillon. Mmmmm!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#0#Yummy flavor! I modified the recipe by adding fresh carrots and celery.. I also made homemade noodles... made soup the day before- didn't add noodles until the next day. Very yummy comfort food! 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#My family loves this recipe. I follow it as written. I once made this for when my college-age daughter caught influence A and was so sick. This soup is definitely comforting...it made her feel better!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#I made this today and thought it was just okay untill I added the sour cream. Then it was really good. Next time I will saute some celery, onions and carrots and add them when I add the chicken. Yummy!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#0#My husband was wanting chicken soup and I found this recipe. I read the reviews and made some of the suggested changes along with some of my own. I poached the chicken and then slightly shredded it, added carrots, celery and onion. I used Amish noodles (giving more homemade flavor) I then added salt, pepper, garlic powder and some parsley stirred in just before serving. I also omitted the sour cream didn't really fit with the soup. My husband tore it up, he ate 2 bowls. I also served it with whole wheat French bread. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Great soup if you want to call it a soup.Makes a hold meal I think.I did use home made chicken broth instead of the chicken bouillon to reduce sodium.Everyone loved it.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#VERY GOOD! The only thing I did different was use my homeade chicken broth instead of the water and boullion. It turned out great!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Easy, creamy, and yummy
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Very good and simple to put together. My husband doesn't like chicken noodle soup. I made this for a sick friend and saved a bowl for him. Surprise, he loved it. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Absolutely delicious! Half the amount of sour cream is plenty. Added carrots to give it some color. A definite keeper in our house!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#We love this, one of our favorites!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#1#This recipe was super easy (I see that as a theme!) I followed the recipe closely except I used the frozen noodles that remind me of grandma's homemade noodles and it was really good with those!! Next time I'll probably add carrots too because it lacks a little color. I also used precooked turkey that I cubed up but my husband requested shredded chicken next time too so I'll try it again that way!! Delicious! 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#0#This is so quick, easy& Good! I use can chicken most of the time and it still is great.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#This recipe earned a high recommendation into our family's list of favorite foods! Only we call it Comfy Chicken Soup.My adult daughters now make this too! We like this recipe less liquid-y. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#0#Wow! This was super creamy and tasty! I, too, added some onion, carrot, and celery, as well as cut back drastically on the sour cream. I also added more broth and used medium egg noodles, just because it was preference. Even with those changes, the recipe as written would still be just as good. I'm pretty sure I'll keep this recipe instead of my previous one. Give this one a try, you won't be disappointed. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#1#I add fresh spinach and grated carrots and fresh black pepper. Excellent soup.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#This was so easy to make and has a wonderful flavor! Thank you for the idea! Great when you are sick craving chicken noodle soup it definitely beats regular canned soup! DELICIOUS!!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Really easy, really good!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#1#Delicious!!! We bulked it up by adding onion, garlic, carrots, celery, mushrooms, and corn. We used curly noodles and fresh ground pepper to top it off. Perfect! I think if making it for others, though, I would stick with the basic recipe. Can't go wrong that way! 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#0#Made this recipe for my mom for mother's day (actually, the first meal I've cooked for her in my new home :) yay!) My whole family had seconds! I forgot the sour cream (yeah, that's what I get for trying to do too many things at once), but it still turned out delicious! I might add a little more liquid next time, though, as I thought it was a little thick (although maybe the sour cream might have helped that?). Definitely making again! 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#This has become a staple in our house for the past few years. Everyone loves it!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Aside from adding Carrots and Celery, stuck straight to the recipe! Sooo delicious! Whole family enjoyed it.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#0#I use Campbells Cream of Chicken & Herbs. Really makes a difference. So good.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#So easy and good! I always add celery, carrots, onion and garlic, and last time I threw in some peas, too. I use the sour cream if I have it on hand, but we don't miss it when I don't have it. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#I forgot to add that we preferred it with the low-fat cream of chicken soup after trying both. The regular soup version was too thick and rich. I normally do not prefer low-fat anything either.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#2#0#This soup has become a family favorite and we have never added the sour cream. We just usually never have it on-hand. We use left-over rotisserie chicken that's been shredded and regular curly noodles. I think half the amount works good as they do swell up and absorb a lot of the liquid. One of these days we will try with egg noodles and sour cream but it is still delicious. My family calls it the good soup . I will definitely keep this recipe. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Excellent just the way it is. Other than adding carrots and celery, I followed the recipe and everyone loved it!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#0#I enjoyed the soup, but 6 1/2 cups of uncooked egg noodles was WAY too much. 4 cups would have been plenty. I added fresh carrots, celery, onion and garlic. The veggies could have soaked up some of the broth, but I doubt it would have left me with that little.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#A family favorite!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#0#This is absolutely the best Chicken Noodle Soup EVER! A friend shared this recipe with me and I have in turn shared it with many more friends. It has become a staple at work whenever someone is in need of a meal. I've used chicken breast and also seasoned rotisserie chicken (which are the easiest), it is wonderful with either! The easy preparation and the economical cost make it even better. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Soooooo easy and so good! I added carrot and celery. Next time I'll add sauted mushroom and onion. I also used a rotisserie chicken; this is a staple soup with lots of options! Yummy! 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#0#We just made this again and it is so good! We used a different kind of noodle and just put some sour cream in our own bowls instead of the pan. SOOO good!!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#This is a fantastic recipe! Its a comforting soup when I'm feeling under the weather or just anytime I want a delicious, hearty and easy to make meal. I HIGHLY recommend this soup just as it is! 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Left out the sour cream and used macaroni noodles instead.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#We LOVE this soup! It is so fast and economical, we make it many times during the winter months.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#Just wondering how much chicken broth I should add to make this soup? 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#0#I have been making this for years, but usually with lite sour cream instead of the real thing. Well, last time I tried it with real sour cream, and it makes a BIG difference! Instead of just being good, now it is so delicious you can hardly stop eating it. Num num num.
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#This is a wonderful recipe! It is so quick and easy. I added carrots and it tasted wonderful!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#this recipe is a classic. i make it often. Add fresh carrots and celery to stock or celery seed of you don't have celery and it gives it great flavor 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#It really comes together as fast as stated! I used light/low-fat ingredients to make it a little healthier. Soooooo delicious!!! I am about to make it again. Will also take to friends! :)
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#I loved it! This recipe is fast easy and deliciously creamy ! I added a celery and pepper and my husband devoured it. 
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#1#0#My whole family loved it It was quick & easy. I added a bag of frozen carrots, and used fat free chicken noodle soup. Will definitely make this one again and again!
Comforting Chicken Noodle Soup#0#0#This is a HUGE hit with my family. It definitely lives up to it's name! 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#1#3#Made this for the first time using the frozen sugared sliced strawberries and it seems to have made the jello not set right. Has anyone else had this issue? Should i have have rinsed them off first? I bet it will still be good! I normally use fresh strawberries and have not had this issue
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Try Raspberry Jello with sliced Strawberries. ?? 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#12#0#I add a layer of blue Jell-O for Memorial Day, Labor Day or 4th of July. I have added a layer of green Jell-O at Christmas.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#15#12#I had great compliments on this. It looked beautiful. I didn't get to eat any as it was a donation for an event but those that tasted it were full of compliments. I was nervous about the pretzel crust, those same people said it was perfect. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#18#2#Absolutely delicious! I always add some fresh lemon zest and a hefty squeeze of lemon juice to the cream cheese filling, which -- according to the collegiate baseball player I hosted one summer -- takes this recipe over the top.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#9#5#I made this for Easter and it was so good. Wasn't able to find sweetened frozen strawberries at my grocery store so I used the unsweetened frozen sliced strawberries. I made it the day before and followed the directions and Test Kitchen tips. The crust was crunchy and the layers were so beautiful! Will make this again. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#29#12#My Precious Momma use to make this every Christmas because our whole family loved it. She tragicly left us 10 yr.s ago and this family favorite has not been made again until this Christmas and I know she is Dancing in the floors of Heaven, because we made it for our Christmal Dinner this year. Thank You Taste of Home. By the way, Mom use to give us girls a subscription to your magazine every year, and I still have every magazine up and until she left us. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#10#0#I didn't have strawberries, so I used raspberries. It turned out delicious. I will make it again with strawberries to compare. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#3#2#Halved the recipe and it still made a lot. Excellent flavor, easy to make, and the dessert turned out wonderfully. Reminds me of Dairy Queen soft serve strawberry sundae. Wonderful!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#11#0#Refreshing and Light. I also made this recipe with raspberries from the garden and raspberry jello.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#12#4#Strawberry Pretzel Dessert is fantastic and Cool Whip works very well.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#45#9#Can you use cool whip instead of whipped topping?
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#13#5#Although I didn't have any frozen berries, all I had to do was freeze a pound of fresh berries. While they were freezing, I prepared the crust and cream cheese filling. It worked great. What a wonderfully fresh and delicious summer dessert! 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#20#4#My family has brought this to picnics for years but this was the first time I tried making it. I kept finding my husband sneaking some of it at nightthat's how I knew how good it really was! Make sure you make time cooling between layersit does help! But can be tedious. Way worth it!!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#12#1#This recipe has been made for our family gatherings for 20+ years now. I took my first crack at it for a Memorial Day BBQ and it was a hit! I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen because I don't like the texture of frozen strawberries. Next time, I might use less sugar to really play up the saltiness of the pretzels.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#5#1#This is a delicious dessert/salad. One that our family enjoys on most holiday dinners and so easy to make. We never tire of it. The savory and sweet really compliment each other. Jean
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#18#10#Does anyone know if this recipe would do okay with homemade whipped cream?
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#7#10#We dont like the pretzels so we use Graham cracker crust. Its awesome
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#3#13#We did not like the pretzel crust way too salty for a desert
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#5#1#This recipe is a family-loved classic that never goes out of style! Don't skip adding sliced sweetened strawberries - it gives this recipe a wonderful fresh flavor and texture. Personally I prefer making homemade whipped cream using heavy whipping cream. I have always made this recipe using strawberries and strawberry Jello, but I think I might try experimenting with different fruits and Jello flavors. This is definitely a 5 star winner!! 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#18#1#This dessert is a long-time favorite for potlucks in western PA, and this is my favorite recipe for it! I substitute real heavy whipping cream for a more natural taste, and it holds up nicely. I also use other fruits sometimes (black cherries with black cherry jello; blueberries with blueberry jello). This is a dessert best eaten as fresh as possible, as the pretzels will start to get soft after the first day. I typically bake my crust the day before, but wait until about 4 hours before serving to assemble. Be sure to completely cool/chill each layer before adding the next. Let the pretzel crust cool to room temp first! Chill after adding the cream cheese mix. And most importantly, let your jello mix cool before adding it to the top, otherwise it will disturb the cream cheese mix and you'll have very unattractive chunks of white in your red jello. Also be sure that the pretzel crust is sealed off from the jello, or it will get soggy. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#10#5#I absolutely LOVE this!!! I don't normally like pretzels but this dessert is phenomenal!! For the most part, I followed the receipe but I changed a couple things. I made it in a 9 X13 glass dish. I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen. I did NOT add any extra sugar. I really like the filling so I doubled the cream cheese. Basically, I make the crust than I mix the jello topping and while it's in the fridge, I make the filling. I folded in the whip cream instead of mixing it all together. That takes about 20 minutes or so. Then, I poured the jello topping on top and put back in the fridge and it turned out perfect. IF you follow the directions, everything should fit nicely. However, since I added the extra cream cheese, the topping was overflowing. I just poured in what fit and it was perfect!!! Ive read that people using fresh strawberries add extra sugar to them but I didn't and it doesn't need any...but that's up to you. As for the extra jello that wouldn't fit, I just put it in a seperate bowl, and after it was set up, added some whipped cream and had that as an extra dessert!!! Everyone loves this dessert...I will make it for everything!! 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Huge success in my house of 3 kids and a husband.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#1#0#Love........ Love this!! No other words need. Wonderful as written.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#7#1#In regards to happycamperd comment about it being really sweet, I used fresh strawberries (that I froze) and sugar free jello and it tastes just as good!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#6#2#I want to be fair with this one as some people may like it so here goes..I made this in a glass pyrex 9 x 13 dish. I bought all of the ingredients as written, but did end up with 2 1/2 cups of coarsely crushed pretzels as I did not want to toss them. It still worked fine and amply covered the bottom of the dish. The crème cheese layer worked best by beating the crème cheese and sugar and then folding in the whip topping, as another reviewer recommended. I was skeptical about the jello layer but followed instructions exactly and it worked fine. I put in fridge after first layer for about 30 minutes. Second layer a bit longer and def spread to edges, as another reviewer wisely recommended. Jello layer chilled for a few hours. Sliced beautifully. Looked pretty on a plate. Did not top with additional whip cream, and honestly it did not need any extra sugar, so that would have mainly been for plating. This is where I have to say, it was way too sweet. no way around it either but I may remove the syrup filled strawberries with fresh. The other steps could perhaps be reduced in sugar, but not eliminated as the sugar serves more than one purpose. SO, aside from being overly sweet, this would be a very nice desert. I would never name this a salad or serve WITH a meal though.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#1#0#So delicious...I have made this many, many times. Everyone loves it!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#1#0#Nice cold dessert
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#7#0#Have been making this for many years and always requested at our potlucks. The last one I did was a frozen bag of strawberries, blueberries, blackberries , and raspberries. I used raspberry jello. Thank you for great recipes and this is another... fool proof recipe and have one in the fridge right now..
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#3#0#I've had this many times but it is the first time making it. I added a little bit of vanilla to the cream cheese. I also used fresh strawberries, sliced and added some sugar. After sitting for 1 hour I stirred well then drained before adding to the gelatin. Topped the dessert with chopped pecans. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#1#My son requested this recipes. So easy to make, so delicious. Everyone enjoyed a second helping, although one person would have preferred the more traditional graham cracker crust. I did add a layer of fresh sliced strawberries before pouring on the jello mixture, which really increased the great strawberry taste. I will be making this again very soon.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#3#1#I was given a recipe very similar to this by a friend, she called it Strawberry Salad. All the ingredients are the same except for brown sugar in the crust and only 1 box of jello. I make it without the pretzels, I use graham crackers instead. This is my absolute favorite dessert!! I love every variation and make it every couple weeks. My grandma always makes what she calls pretzel cake it is another variation made with dream whip and cherry pie filling instead of the strawberries and jell-o. All of them are great and worth making for get togethers.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#1#0#I grew up without any idea of jello salads etc... I actually thought I hated jello because it was so blahhh. My sweet friend Pam made this for a Bible Study and my mouth came alive. Perfect blend of sweet
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#2#1#Bez, my Mom's recipe does not use jello. Crust is the same except 2 1/2 cups coarsely crushed pretzels. Filling cream cheese and sugar only blended into 2 envelopes of whipped Dream Whip. Topping is canned fruit pie filling. Maybe this is close to your grandma's. My mom passed a few years back so this is the best I can do. Hope it helps. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I was looking for the recipe my grandma used, and while this is close, it's not the right recipe. The jello layer is too thick and the middle layer is too loose. However, out of all the recipes my relatives have tried since my grandma passed away, this is the closest. I think I will use one box of jello and one package of strawberries next time and for the filling, 1 1/2 cups of cool whip and powdered sugar instead. I'll let you know how it goes! Still a tasty dessert with this recipe.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#2#1#Sarah, gelatin has a working temperature range and heating it too high will denature it effectively removing its gelling capabilities. The recipe says to boil water then dissolve the jello in a bowl. That doesn't cook it any further and the bowl actually brings the temperature down. Did you dissolve it in the pot while still simmering/boiling? I wouldn't even boil the water. Just get it hot enough to dissolve the jello. Hope this helps and is in time for you to try again. Cheers. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#5#2#@Sarah (from Dec. 16, 2019): What the recipe doesn't explain very well in step 3 is that you follow the jello recipe on the box for the amount of boiling water to add, but you DO NOT add the cold water according to the box, and you instead add in the thawed berries. Otherwise the jello gets too runny. That's what I think may have happened to your dessert.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#4#1#I made this recipe yesterday. I followed everything the recipe says. I had it in the fridge over night, i went to cut into it today and the jello part is completely soupy. Can anyone tell me what went wrong? P.s. very disappointed
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#3#1#I use this recipe at Thanksgiving; but instead of strawberries, I add 2 cans of whole berry cranberry sauce to the strawberry gelatin. It is so good!!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#At any potluck, this recipe is the first to go. The sweet salty is divine!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#1#0#I have a question...can you make this with any flavor gelatin and fruit? I was thinking about peach/peach or orange with mandarin oranges, or lime/pineapple. Thoughts??
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#1#0#My niece is allergic to strawberries so I make this with raspberries, it is DELICIOUS, and I have been asked for the recipe several times! :). Live this dessert, YUM!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#1#I love this can't wait to make it for my family 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#This is the best!!! rave reviews at Easter dinner
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#this is a really great recipe.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#We LOVE this dessert and make it all of the time. It's fabulous and turns out great every time!! Thanks so much for sharing. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#My family has enjoyed this for years. I recently lost my recipe and failed to remember proportions. Thanks for printing them again.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#1#1#I have made this delicious recipe for years. It has always turned out wonderful, receives great reviews and many requests for the recipe! I prefer a coarser chop on the pretzels (rather than totally crushed and use 2 2/3 c because of this). Do let it cool completely. Cream the softened cream cheese and sugar we'll before folding in the whipped topping. This makes it easier to spread. Be sure to seal all of the edges to the side of the pan and the partially set jello/strawberry mix will not soak into the other layers. Yummy! 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Always a favorite! I sometimes do raspberry as well.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I used about 21/2 cups of pretzels to fit the 9x13 dish to get enough base to cover bottom of dish. I found it interesting that it only called for the boiling water to make the jello but it worked. The Jello box calls for two cups boiling and two cups ice cold water. My guess is person who commented they had too much jello followed recipe on Jello box and not this recipe. I sliced up frozen strawberries as I didn't have pre-sliced and added them when not completely thawed to act as substitute for cold water and it worked. The jello doesn't look as pretty as picture but that may be because I let it sit too long to gel in freezer.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#This came out wonderful and everyone enjoyed it. Very simple to make but I could not find the frozen sliced strawberries at any of our markets, so used fresh that I sliced up and added a touch of sugar to bring out the juice and added that to the Jell-O. Was very fresh tasting and will definitely make again.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#1#Recipe was easy! The hardest part was waiting on each step to chill. It fit PERFECTLY in a 9x13 pan. None left over at all. The grandkids loved it and I will definitely make again! I followed the instructions exactly EXCEPT my frozen strawberries were not sweetened. I did not add sugar and it was still wonderful.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#1#This recipe is great except it does not fit a 9 x, 13 x 2 inch pan. When I poured the gelatin mixture on top,, I had the jello mixture on the floor. Was not happy to be washing a sticky mess off my kitchen floor at 5:30 AM. Does anyone know of a source for a 4, 13,9 in pan.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#1#I used only half the sugar in the filling and it was absolutely delicious! Cool the crust thoroughly, and eat within a day of making this.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#My grandmother used to make this all the time - it's so good! However, she used to have the strawberry's in the middle, and the whipped cream mix on the top with (additional) crushed pretzel pieces on top of that. I'm so glad I found this.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#1#2#This was the sweetest thing I've ever eaten in my entire life. I could have completely skipped the sugar and it would have been fine. Unless you're using unsweetened whipped cream and Jello, I promise you it's going to be WAY too sweet for you. The consistency was also nothing like the above photo. You HAVE to let the pretzel mixture cool COMPLETELY before adding the filling or the whipped cream just melts and there's no texture. I would even recommend putting it in the fridge to get super cold before putting the filling on it. I had a headache after eating this because of the sugar, so, like i said before, skip the sugar!!!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I would give this minus stars if I could. Followed the directions exactly. The crust was mushy and the layers were just way way too sweet. No one at the table liked it at all. The only one who cared for it was the trash can which is where it ended up. What a waste.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#The best! Had to make with gluten free pretzels and came out perfectly!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Why bother to see recipes if you can't print them? Do the publishers to follow the recipe on your phone while making it? 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#This is an EXCELLENT DESSERT had it on Memorial Day, it was hit. So easy to make; nice dessert for a potluck dish, you can't go wrong.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#My family loves this! I use raspberry jello and frozen sweetened raspberries
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Excellent. My family loves this dessert. They beg for it
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#1#0#I had this years ago very good I'm glad I could find the recipe again ewill be making next weekend 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#We love the flavors together...the sweet and salty. I had to make 1 1/2 crusts in order to completely fill my 9x13 pan. I think it would be better to have a thicker cream cheese filling. It was definitely not as thick as the picture. Seemed to take quite awhile (at least 2 hours) for the gelatin layer to partially set. Then again, maybe it set too much because it seemed to slide off the cream cheese layer once it was cut. I like the idea of using a 16 oz. container of fresh strawberries instead of the frozen.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I've been making this for years. It's one of my son-in-law's favorites. He likes it best made with raspberries. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I have made this wonderful dessert several times and people keep asking me to please make it again! It has the most savory taste a sweet blend of strawberries with the nutty and salty taste of the pretzels. This is one dessert you won't regret making and I'm sure you'll be asked to bring it again! 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Just made it. After reading the reviews, I cut the sugar in the cream cheese mixture to a half cup, instead of the full cup. Delicious and gone very quickly. Will definitely make again soon.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Perfect. I wouldn't change a thing. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#High hopes with so many great reviews. Unfortunately, this is way too sweet. On the bright side - the kids love the sugar rush and candy bar like sweetness, so 2 stars for that. Cool whip and 1 cup of sugar with the cream cheese, then jello and the sweet syrup strawberries. Next time I'll find another version of this with a lot less sugar and using heavy whipping cream. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#My man loved this dessert. Was easy to make and tastes great.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#1#0#To avoid issues that some people had you MUST PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO KITCHEN TIPS LISTED & DETAILS1) Cool crust COMPLETELY.( I CHILL THE CRUST after it has cooled a bit on counter) Be sure to spread the cream cheese layer ALL THE WAY TO OUTER EDGES, so that it is touching the edges of the pan.(then chill)..This avoids letting the jello topping seep down into the crust DO NOT cut the amount of sugar IN THE CRUST.PART of recipe.It is needed to make it crispy.To speed up the jello portion I dissolve the sugar ( 1/2 C. to 2/3 Cup NOT 1 full cup) into ONLY 1 CUP BOILING WATER....Then when sugar is FULLY DISSOLVED I add in the remaining 1 Cup VERY COLD water ( OR COLD juice) drained off from thawed strawberries to equal1 cup ) Be very sure the jello is partially set before spooning evenly over CHILLED cream cheese layerYou do not want the jello fully set BUT you DO NOT want it to be a pourable liquid either. IF the jello fully sets before you get to it...just warm SLIGHTLY for a FEW SECONDS AT A TIME in the microwave till it is SEMI SET. BT not warm. Sometimes I grate some dark chocolate over the whipped cream garnish dallops, before adding the pretzel garnish....If I remember to pick up some chocolate covered pretzels for the garnish,Good recipe but the directions could include more specific details and the sugar in the jello could be cut down to 2/3 cup....maybe even 1/2 C. especially if the frozen strawberries are sweetened type..
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I made this desert along time ago and I had forgotten how exactly to make it. So glad you posted this now i can start making it again
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#it turned out really good!! i drained the strawberries and used the juice in place of the water, it didnt quite reach 2 cups so i topped it off with water an it set in no time
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I can't find frozen strawberries that are sweetened anymore. How much sugar needs to be added to the unsweetened strawberries & should they set awhile to bring out the juice? 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#1#0#My kids and I loved this! Husband doesn't eat sweets so more for us! Winner. I saw some of the comments about the jello being too runny- I used fresh strawberries macerated in sugar. I poured them into the jello and let the jello strawberry mixture set for over an hour in the fridge - I then poured it over the cream cheese mixture. It was still pretty runny but set up really nice in the fridge. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I remembered making a similar recipe years ago that was delicious, but this wasn't it! The gelatin layer wouldn't set, it was just too watery. Probably because of the syrup on the frozen, sweetened strawberries. The pretzel crust was not crunchy and was total mush on day 2. I was careful not to make any deviation from the recipe, and even made it a second time, which did not turn out any better. I made this to take to a ladies tea at church, and was quite disappointed. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#1#I made this, and while it was very tasty, I didn't care for the pretzel crust. I will make this again, but will use a graham cracker crust. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#i'm pretty disappointed with this recipe. i've made this in the past and it always turned out great. this recipe changed things up a bit from what i'm used to and i figured it would be interesting to try something new. the strawberries in syrup was a bad choice. mixing them with the jello just made it way too watery. i was supposed to bring it to work today for a potluck, but instead it's still sitting in my fridge because the jello layer is still soup. next time, either do regular frozen berries or fresh. skip the syrup. also, i agree with some reviewers that the cream cheese layer is too thin. definitely browse around to find other variations of this recipe before moving forward. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I make this sugar free and you cant tell....Its amazing, been doing this for YEARS. Its always requested and never gets tiring!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I have made this recipe for over 30 years and has always been a family and friend favorite. Years ago I changed to 1/2 strawberry and 1/2 raspberry gelatin and fruit and I got even better raves
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#this is so good, I made it as sugar free as was possible and it turned better than I ever thought. My family is starting to think I went back to school to learn how to cook.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I have made this for over 20 yrs. it's a gotta have at every holiday. I use 2 8 oz packages of cream cheese, that I mix the sugar into with an electric mixer. I then fold in with a spatula 1-1/2 containers of cool whip. Spread all the way to edges. I refrigerate while I make the jello layer. I only use 1 16 oz bag of unsweetened strawberries, no juice. I stir in cutting them into halves or quarters until jello thickens. I then pour over the cream cheese layer and refrigerate. A family favorite that with these tips, I hope you enjoy a more consistent result. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Been making this for years! Everyone loves it. A friend at work made it with raspberry jello and used the frozen mixed berries. That is my new favorite!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#This is a really good recipe. I made it exactly as given with the addition of one teaspoon of vanilla to the cream cheese layer. I might use two teaspoons next time. I used an 11 x 8.5 pan because my 9 x 13 inch pan had something in it. Everything fit but the gelatin layer, had enough extra for four ramekins of strawberry Jell-O. Changes I would make next time: add a full cup of butter to the pretzels, add a teaspoon of unflavored gelatin to the Jell-O to make it firmer (I was worried it might melt in transit), it didn't. The ladies at church told me I could bring this again, anytime! 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Great Dessert
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#We use this for a senior party we have each month. They love it!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I've been making this for about 10 years now and it's always been a winner. I think the people that are saying the cream layer is too thin are beating the mixture too much. I just fold my ingredients together and it stays nice and fluffy and is plenty to cover a 13x9 pan. I've also had an issue with the jello mixture leaking through to the pretzel layer but I know each time it happened, I didn't make sure the cream layer went all the way to the edges. That is important. But if it does leak through, it's still pretty darn tasty. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#This is a delicious dessert! Made recipe as is and the jello strawberry layer did not set and was soupy. It was suggested next time, to layer fresh sliced strawberries on top of cool whip layer and then once the jello mix has sighty set to carefully pour over strawberries. If you make the recipe as is I would suggest using a packet or two of the Knox gelatin or draining some of the syrup from the strawberries. No one complained about the taste or it being soupy so it was a win regardless. Next time I'll read the other reviews before jumping in 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#This is definitely a make again! My family and I loved it. Made exactly as directed and turned out perfect. Everyone was disappointed when it was gone.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I've enjoyed this dessert before, and wanted to try to make it myself. I think the numbers here are a bit off. As recommended in the comments, I used a larger dish. There is a problem with the amount of pretzels used. The cream cheese layer is delicious and super sweet and very, very thin (and would be just very thin in the smaller pan.) It would also make a good dip for fresh berries. Speaking of berries, 32 ounces of frozen strawberries??? I think that might be a mistake too. I'm not pleased with this outcome, and hope I have time to shop and redo it before the picnic tomorrow. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Favorite in our householdI use the 11x7
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I have made this recipe for over 25 years. I make it upside down. I was tired of soggy pretzels on the bottom if the Cool Whip layer was not sealed precisely. I also liked to take this to school pot lucks in a disposable pan (the sides of the aluminum pan are never smooth) .I put the jello/strawberry combo in the bottom of the pan and let that set up firm. Then I spread the Cool Whip layer. I put the pretzels on right before serving to ensure they stay crunchy. If you want, you can leave the pretzels on the side in case someone does not like pretzels.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Excellent
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#This is a family favorite. I find the saltiest pretzels to use because the sweet/salty is such a great combination.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#1#0#One of my favorite dishes that I feel is always good. I took the suggestions of using a smaller dish and put it in 11 x 9 dish (one reason, was because I used my bigger dishes for other things). It was full! I ended up spilling the jello on the way to the fridge (partly because I don't think it was set enough before hand). I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen. I suggest making sure you leave ample time between steps so layers have time to set. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I make this recipe out of a local recipe book that uses raspberries instead of strawberries. I'm hungry for strawberries so gonna use them instead (making this for our family lunch tomorrow). I always double the pretzels because that's the best part. But I don't double the butter. This recipe is AWESOME! 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Amazing!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Best desert ever! I used fresh strawberries and it tasted amazing. Ever time I make it it's gone in minutes. It's always a request for any gathering I go to. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#This dish is a tradition for every one of our family gatherings. It is one of the most requested dishes. We don't wait for dessert; we serve it as a part of the meal! The combination of sweet and salty is perfect. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Made this for Christmas dinner. So good after a heavy meal!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I would use an 11 x 7 dish for this recipe - and I cut the Pretzels to about 1 1/2 cups -- otherwise it's too much crunch. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Great recipe and taste great. Love the salty and sweet. The only reason why I gave 3 stars was trying to cut through the sliced strawberries was a problem. Maybe next time I'll cut the berries in slivers. Will try again. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#1#If you do not thaw the berries, it helps the gelatin set up better and it won't be runny. My family prefers this made with raspberries. I add some fresh berries along with the frozen and also use unsweetened berries. Doing it this way, we never have a runny gelatin problem or have the dessert separate. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I love this recipe. I have been making it for years. The only thing I do different is I add a can of drained crushed pineapple to the cream cheese layer. So yummy!!!!!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#My kids enjoyed this... it was OK to me... I think I would of liked it better with fresh strawberries and not frozen. Next time I'll try with fresh. The flavor was good though
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#This recipe was very delicious except....the jello ran down the sides of the filling and sogitized (made soggy) the pretzel crust. I think next time, I'll skip the gelatin and use a cooked concoction of berries and cornstarch. And yes, the 9x13 dish is too large in my opinion. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I make this several times a year and love it. I always make this when I go to pot-luck dinners. Unfortunately for me I take home an empty pan; no left overs.I have one problem with it. Whenever I make it, and I follow the directions exactly, the jello always slides off the filling on people's plates. What can I do so it stays together on someone's plate? It doesn't bother me but it has bothered those around me. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#We have made this for years. Love it with raspberry gelatin and tangy raspberries as well.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Love the salty and sweet together.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#1#0#The recipe list would probably be better suited for a 9x9 pan. With the ingredients on this list, I got a very thin filling layer that took work to spread without pulling up the pretzels after they were baked.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#The whole house loved it. Two even picked it for next birthday cake
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#my husband just loves this.... i even tried it with blueberries and raspberries... yummy
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#My husband raved about this dessert! Easy and delicious; going to make it again very soon!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#love it, been looking for this one for a long time. Tasted it several years ago at a gathering, but didn't know what it was called. Thanks for posting it! 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#The sweetness of the cream cheese mixture and strawberries is a nice contrast to the saltiness and crunch of the pretzels. I've made this recipe as a side dish, snack, and dessert! 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#This is a great recipe, been making it for years. I switch off by using raspberries in place of the strawberries. Equally as good either way. Of course change the jello to raspberry as well.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Really love the taste! I used sugar free jello, Stevia as sugar substitute, fresh sliced strawberries, and low fat dairy. My only complaint was that the pretzel crust was so crumbly. I did put pretzels in the blender. Any suggestions how to get a more compact crust that sticks together?
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#1#0#Great recipe. I have been making it for years. You can make it with Splenda in place of sugar and use sugar free jello. This recipe is a must for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Really good!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Summertime at its best! My elderly neighbor I grew up beside gave me this recipe years ago. The only thing I do differently is use fresh strawberries. YUM!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#A family favorite. Made it for Christmas and hoped for left overs.......there were none!! Good any time of year for any occasion.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Very Good :o)Perfect combo of sweet & saltyI would reccomend putting the pretzels in a blender or food processor and pulsing them a few times it is quicker and easier than putting them in a bag and pounding them ! Also I used fresh strawberries ... YUM 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Perfect combo of sweet & salty ...so good :o)I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#This is one of our favorite recipes. I always make it for Easter and this year my 6 year granddaughter went crazy for it! Love it everyone should try it !
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#It was soooo good!! The differant flavors hitting my taste buds, was awesome. Love it!!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#1#0#My grandmother gave me this recipe about 35 years ago, only she named it Pretzel Salad , why? I don't know. I like the name of this recipe. The only difference in recipes is I use powder sugar where your's calls out sugar. I love, love, love this recipe. It's usually at the holidays that I make it. But you can make it every week if you want, it's that good. 
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#I use dole frozen sliced strawberries, without the syrup..still tastes amazing! I make this for EVERYTHING!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Sooo good! Perfect blend of flavors! Everyone loves it! Make sure to crush pretzels very well.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#This is a family favorite!
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#Great recipe, it was a hit at our Easter party.
Strawberry Pretzel Salad#0#0#So good and very easy to make!
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#I made this and I think it has great flavor. I just don't understand why it was so soupy. I cooked my pasta al dente to have it soak up some of the juice. Next time I will omit the juice from the tomatoes and cut back on the chicken broth by 1/4 cup. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#This was tasty and the house smelled wonderful as it cooked. We really liked it but didn't love it. It took a fair amount of prep too. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#7#2#I followed the recipe except for using a can of tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano. It was very good but hubby and I both agreed that we would like it even better with Italian sausage. And that's how I will make it next time. Thank you for the recipe.
Chicken Penne Casserole#11#2#I sub the chicken with beans and use veggie stock and whole wheat penne a great vegetarian meal.
Chicken Penne Casserole#13#6#This is an excellent recipe! I have made it three times now! I prepare the recipe as written, and double it! My son-in-law is Italian and he appreciates it each time I make it! Can be prepared the day before, and placed in the oven when everyone arrives!! Also, any leftovers (if there are any) are just as delicious when reheated!
Chicken Penne Casserole#13#5#Great recipe. You can substitute pretty much any heartier pasta you have on hand. I personally do not put the tomatoes in a blender, as I like them more chunky. I also don't layer. I just put everything together and top with the cheeses. Perfect comfort food!! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#12#0#This is excellent. I used macaroni noodles instead of penne and skipped the blender step.
Chicken Penne Casserole#16#1#I served along with some nice crusty bread and received nothing but compliments at the bowling banquet. That's what I'M talkin about! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#14#12#I used up some leftover uncooked pasta (shells, spirals) and didn't blend the tomatoes and paste since I don't have a blender. Everything still turned out well. I usually prefer something other than chicken in my pasta dishes but overall not a bad dinner. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#10#0#This is really as good as the reviews said. I made exactly as per recipe. I will likely double next time.
Chicken Penne Casserole#40#4#This is a great recipe. I did my prepping in the morning so all I had to do was put it together in the afternoon. I will double the recipe next time. Everyone in the family went back to seconds. My dad (age 98) loves it and already asked me to make it again.
Chicken Penne Casserole#19#0#I agree! This recipe is the best!! I make it exactly as written and everyone loves it! I have also made it with ground beef and beef broth and everyone loves it!
Chicken Penne Casserole#24#14#Now I know why you said your family never tires of this recipe. I used a pound of pre-seasoned Italian chicken breast I had in the freezer. I did rinse the chicken before cooking so the seasoning didn't mix with the recipe. Glad to see this recipe was a contest winner because it deserves the highest rating possible. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#18#1#I doubled this and substituted a pound of lean ground beef for the chicken, and beef broth for the chicken broth. Great sauce recipe. Thank you, Carmen and TOH.
Chicken Penne Casserole#36#18#You definitely need to double this! As usual w/ me, I tweaked it to fit my needs/taste. Even with doubling this, I used a bit more chicken, red & green peppers, onion and garlic. Plus I used a bit less cheese (not a fan of too much ooey-gooey cheese). I used olive oil instead of canola oil. Turned out exactly as I had envisioned.  Oh, who came up with 35 min prep time??. This was time consuming, but so is any homemade dish that requires this much cutting, blending, sautéing, etc. Be prepared for a cpl of hours. It was worth it.  Love that I have left-overs ( the intention)! It tasted so healthy and so not-restauranty (which is usually so salty & bloats me - yuck!). 
Chicken Penne Casserole#12#7#Fantastic recipe. My daughter helped me last night and it was delicious. Easy to make and I'm glad I had her help. I ended up making a few changes by accident, I could not find a green bell pepper so we used the sweet red and orange pepper. I did not have chicken thighs on hand so I used chicken breasts - I used 1.5 pounds. I added 2 cups of gluten free penne pasta. Along with the spices (except red pepper flakes) mentioned to use I also added Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb and black pepper - did not measure just eyed it when added. I also added 1 cup of sodium free chicken broth due to the extra half cup of pasta. Cooked as instructed and the remaining uncovered was cooked for only 15 minutes. I did forget to add the romano cheese, no one really noticed. I will make this again and add into our rotation. we paired this with a nice spinach salad. Looking forward to left overs. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#45#4#I made this as written, but the pairing of tomato sauce and chicken was not a hit in our house. I made this again, using ground hot Italian sausage instead of chicken. Not a bite was leftover !
Chicken Penne Casserole#13#1#I was all set to make this and realized I didn't have enough of any shaped pasta, so I substituted angel hair. I followed the recipe as written and we all loved it. Now I always use angel hair and I do double the sauce amount. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#6#1#This is an excellent recipe. Very tasty!
Chicken Penne Casserole#9#1#This is a delicious casserole! It does take some prep work before baking, but well worth it. We found it to be dry the first time, so we like to double the sauce.
Chicken Penne Casserole#6#1#Pretty good. I followed this recipe, except for the salt and red pepper flakes. The chicken was tender and had lots of flavor.
Chicken Penne Casserole#18#6#By substituting eggplant, zucchini and/or mushrooms for the chicken, this could be a very good vegetarian casserole. You could also use any or all of those ingredients to bump up the dish, if you like those ingredients. As one previous reviewer mentioned, I love that the recipe is versatile enough to accommodate variations to the family's tastes. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#12#7#To the commentor who used Parmesan because they didn't have Romano: those two cheeses are pretty much interchangeable. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Looks fabulous. Can't wait to try it.
Chicken Penne Casserole#13#4#I really want to try this recipe but I live in a very hot climate and don't want to turn on my oven. Has anyone tried making it in a crock pot? 
Chicken Penne Casserole#5#0#Excellent recipe, everyone loved it. The sauce would be great with any pasta. I am going to make a lasagna today using the sauce.
Chicken Penne Casserole#5#1#This did not take as long to make as I thought it would. I did do a few short cuts though. I didn't blend the tomatoes and it turned out just fine. I only simmered the chicken mixture 10 minutes and only left the dish in the oven for 10 minutes after uncovering. It still was delicious. Ground beef or sausage could easily replace the chicken. I'm not a big fan of chicken in red sauces but most dishes of this kind use beef or sausage so the chicken was a nice change of pace. The chicken could even be shredded or cut very small so it's not as noticeable. This could easily be prepared ahead of time for a busy next day. Prepare the chicken mixture and refrigerate since it's the step that takes the longest or prepare the entire dish and bake it the next day. We are a family of 5 and so there is only a few small servings left over. Next time I may double it and bake it in a 9x13 pan instead of an 8x8. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#16#5#Made this for my family of picky eaters. I read previous comments as well prior to making. Yes it does take some prep time as people have statdd. Also, scared for it to be bland as I knew I'd be leaving out salt to accommodate sodium-restricted family members, I took the advice of doubling up the other spices. I used mozzarella, provalone and parmesan for the cheeses. This was a HUGE hit with everyone and I love that it seems like this recipe could leave room for a lot of little personal tweaks and substitutions if one so chose to implement any. Definitely committing this to the recipe book! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#2#0#Made as directed. Wonderful flavor. I will definitely make this a regular!
Chicken Penne Casserole#20#1#Can this be made the night before and then baked the next day?
Chicken Penne Casserole#4#2#This recipe was a success :) I made a few changes- I didn't use red peppers because I had none, instead I threw in a can of those diced green chiles, gave it a nice flavor. Also, added two tablespoons of ricotta in with the sauce. Also, used a tiny bit more chicken than called for and to be honest I could have gone with even more chicken in retrospect! I would easily use 2lbs instead of 1 next time! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#4#24#I made this but honestly I'm a quick short cut cook . I skipped the cooking the veg part ( added three kinds of sweet peppers , sliced mushrooms ), used half of a whole chicken which I chopped . Didn't have Romano cheese used Parmesan , I also used two generous teaspoons of Italian seasoning (all about substituting right) . I put it in a preheated 400 oven uncovered for 15 mins then turned the oven down to 350 for another 30 ,we loved it I would make it again. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#5#Bland
Chicken Penne Casserole#2#1#Loved it, and the aroma in your kitchen will dazzle your senses. Followed to the recipe.
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#4#So time consuming! I don't think the outcome was worth the effort. I forgot Romano cheese (which I didn't have anyway) so I sprinkled Parmesan on top which improved the taste. I'm sure the taste would be better had I remembered the Romano, but again lots of time required to make this. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#4#2#Awesome! My family nearly fought over who would get to take the leftovers to school and work with them, today! (Do yourself a favor ... double the recipe!) Absolutely one of the best pasta dishes I've had, EVER. Prep time takes a bit longer than noted, but worth every minute. Company and special occasion worthy, hands down! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#2#0#Love the flavors of this dish. As one Vernonite to another, thank you for this recipe!
Chicken Penne Casserole#2#0#Husband loves it
Chicken Penne Casserole#2#1#Deconstructed Lasagna, I used cottage cheese as I didn't have any romano cheese. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#3#0#Yep, it's THAT good!!! :) 
Chicken Penne Casserole#2#0#I love this recipe, it was so tasty and delicious.
Chicken Penne Casserole#3#0#I made this recipe tonight and we thought it was delicious. I did read some of the reviews and made some changes. I used Italian style tomatoes without blending and I increased the basil and oregano to 2 teaspoons. It gave the dish plenty of flavor. I baked it for 30 minutes then removed the cover and finished cooking the last 10 minutes. It was perfect. We will be having this again. I highly recommend it.Volunteer Field Editor
Chicken Penne Casserole#2#0#Perfect dinner-spiced perfect-my husband loved it and wants it again soon. 5 stars!
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#1#I made this last night, exactly as the recipe said (extra garlic just to use it up and no wine!). It was AMAZING! Reminded me of a lasagna with the cheesy goodness. I questioned only using 1 1/2 cups of dry penne pasta, but I'm glad I didn't use more. It filled an 8x8 pan to the top (put a sheet underneath to catch drips while baking) and easily serves 6. This is a keeper! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#I would like the nutritional value, Please
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Yum! Added some Italian seasoning. Liked the heat from the red pepper flakes!
Chicken Penne Casserole#5#0#I made this for the first time last week. As someone else mentioned, it was quite time consuming but some of the ingredients could be prepped in advance. It was okay in the end (had more flavor the next day eaten as leftovers after it sat in the fridge overnight). I found that the chunks of chicken became overcooked a bit when following the cooking instructions.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#1#Loved the flavor!! Will definitely make again and again.
Chicken Penne Casserole#2#0#EXCELLENT! I have made so many different versions of this it is hard to know where to start. I have increased the spices 2 teaspoons, added fresh spinach, added fresh basil and/or basil paste, doubled the onion, green pepper and red bell pepper, and I have added green onion.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Really enjoyed this recipe!!!! Loved the little bit of heat the crushed red pepper flakes gave it! This is Definitely a keeper!
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Still needs more flavor. This will probably be better tomorrow. It takes a very long time to make though, so I'm not sure if I'll make this again. I think it's a great base recipe for sure. I wanted to rate this as is and not make any changes. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#Delicious! We all loved it and will make it again~
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#Very flavorful! Does take awhile to prepare, but its worth it!
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#Made this tonight, full well thinking it would be better tomorrow after the flavors blended. I'm sure it will be, but it was pretty darn fantastic right away! I didn't have Romano cheese, but used fresh-grated Parmesan. Very acceptable substitution! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#I made this for dinner last night, it was awesome. This will be one I make over and over again. My kids loved it for lunch the next day too!
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#Everyone says this is time consuming.... good dishes usually are! But you can also shortcut, I used jarred Arrabbiata Sauce that really upped the flavor!
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#This dish was ok but nothing fantastic to us. Time consuming to put together also. Not likely to make it again.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Made as directed. Thought it was better the next day when the flavors came through better. Was rather bland when we had it for supper the evening I made it.
Chicken Penne Casserole#2#2#I made this dish tonight and it was delicious. I only used 2 cups of cheese and also used jarred spaghetti sauce instead of processing tomatoes and paste. Turned out great. I also added my own seasonings on top of what's called for in the recipe to give it a lil more spice. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#Made this tonight,was very good,I used chicken breast also,I also doubled the sauce cause it didn't seem like it would be enough,glad I did it came out awesome! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Good but was time consuming.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Great dish! I used chicken breast instead of thighs because that is what was in my kitchen. My family enjoyed it so I will be making it again.
Chicken Penne Casserole#3#0#This was absolutely delicious--I made it exactly according to the recipe and it turned out perfectly. I was thinking of adding some spinach or eggplant for a little extra color but I'm glad I didn't. Will be making and sharing this recipe often! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Oh my.... This is an excellent recipe. Easy to make and no left overs! Thank you for sharing.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Amazing recipe, except I use chicken breast instead of chicken thighs and I left off the crushed red pepper flakes due to my Crohn's disease. Thanks for sharing this recipe! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#What an amazing dish!! Follow the recipe exact and you won't be disappointed. Oh my gosh, is this good.......oh, and I just used chicken breast cubed as that is what I had on hand. Will try it with thighs next.....bet that will be even more incredible, as flavorful as thighs are! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#I've made this 3 times just as written. It's delicious and a perfect casserole to give away as well. My green and red peppers were twice as large as needed so I froze the remainders chopped, allowing them to freeze on a plastic dish before putting them into a freezer bag. Thank you so much for sharing this, Carmen! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#My family loved it
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#This was very good!
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#This recipe is very good - when MADE :)
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#This recipe is very good - when MADE :)
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#1#it was ok. maybe use less chicken next time.
Chicken Penne Casserole#4#2#kareni1946 - please do not rate a recipe until you have made it. We don't care how you cook your stuff we just want a'real' review of this recipe 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#1#Sounds really good. My hubs isn't fond of green bell peppers; I usually dice up some zucchini and/or eggplant, and sometimes (in lieu of chicken) sauté a pound of ground sweet or hot Italian sausage to the sauce mixture. I make my own all-day marinara. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#Very good receipe. Didn't have green pepper so used a whole red pepper and 6 chesse Italian blend for the mozzarella. The wife wants me to make this next week for her girls card party. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#I made this today and it was very, very good! I used 2 chicken breasts and a can of Italian diced tomatoes. I didn't have the peppers so will plan better next time. We all loved this casserole and I know we will be making it again . . . real soon! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#This was just ok to us.
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#I made this recipe for my family last night and it was a hit. I added 2tbsp of Chinese chili sauce instead of the flakes, added 7 cloves of garlic and used boneless chicken breasts. My picky children and picky hubby loved it. I served this dish with oven toasted Italian garlic bread.
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#This recipe is so versatile.We prefer boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs. I use Italian Seasoning Blend instead of the individual spices for ease of preparation.There are also many varieties of Diced Tomatoes available. Fire-Roasted are a nice change as well as using Italian Blend Shredded Cheese.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Dish needed more sauce and sausage mixed with ground beef or turkey would've been much better. Overall flavor was good though. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Easy to make and yummy! Will definately be making this again soon!
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#I have been making this recipe regularly without processing the tomatoes. I also add a whole 6 oz can of paste and just add some water if necessary. Last week I added some chopped salami and pepperoni that was leftover from another recipe, and it really added to the flavor.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#5 Stars!I'm always on the lookout for great casseroles and this one fits the bill!You can use any leftover chopped poultry.I've even prepared this with our leftover holiday turkey!I also streamlined the recipe by using an Italian blend seasoning, omitted the salt, as we watch our sodium intake, prepared chopped or crushed garlic. an Italian-blend cheese and grated Parmesan cheese in place of the Romano.It is delicious and so versatile! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#I love this recipe. It is so easy to make and I will make it over and over agai. My boyfriend is one picking eater. But he absolutely loved it.
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#Faultless! I made this dish exactly the way it's written and I wouldn't change a thing. It was easy and delish! A winner for my house and'on the menu' from now on! Cheers for sharing! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Great Recipe that our whole family loved. Very tasty and freezes well too. Definatley on the regular menu list for us.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Great recipe, simple and very tasty. I will definetly add this to my go-to meals!
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#My family loved this casserole and I have one very picky eater. It was very easy to make and tasted very good. Will definitely make again !!!
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Very, very good! Will definitely make again, although hubby asked to skip the red pepper flakes next time.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Oh, and I also completely forgot the chicken stock, it was still a little thin so I added some cornstarch/water mix and it got nice and dense.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Fantastic flavor- quite zippy, too! the one major thing I'd change is that the peppers got quite soggy cooking as long as the chicken. Next time I'm going to add them at the earliest half-way through the chicken-cooking time. The rest of it was Fantastic! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#The was amazing! I doubled it and accidentally tripled the chick. stock so i had to cook it longer, which i recommend regardless, and added some more water and a cut potato to absorb the salt of the chicken stock. I added some ricotta i had in the frige, but that was the only change. My family isn't huge on spicy but I decided just to do it exactly as it stated anyway(I refer to the pepper flakes). I am so glad I did!! Just a touch of hotness and the kids loved it too (3 and 5)! Thanks for a great dish!! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Excellent!!! A perfect amount of spice!!! Loved it. Will make it again and again.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#I wanted to share my changes since I make this quite often. I skip the blender step and add a whole 6 oz can of tomato paste. Instead of chicken broth, I just add a half cup of wine. I've also been using a shredded italian cheese blend which adds another layer of flavor. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#This recipe is a keeper, if my husband goes back for seconds. Very good.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Delicious. Used 1 lb. leftover cooked chicken and added 1/2 cup mushrooms to the vegetable mix as i had them and wanted to use them up.
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#1#Delicious and easy! A definite weeknight winner in our house. You can use chicken breast if you don't have the thighs on hand, and I just use a can of crushed/pureed tomatoes or tomato sauce along with the paste. That way I don't have to get out my blender; I can just dump it in the pan and save time. Great blend of spices and seasonings too! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#The spiciness made me step back and go Where did that come from? It was absolutely fantastic. Much better than your average chicken penne casserole. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#This is delicious! My husband's favorite casserole - and my kids love it, too! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#1#I've made this recipe a couple of times. We like that it uses chicken thighs and the kick that it gets from the red pepper flakes. It's a nice alternative to a ground beef pasta dish. I usually keep Parmesan cheese on hand, so I used it instead of Romano. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#We just tried this. Hubby is VERY satisfied! I want to try it with sausage instead of the chicken. DELICIOUS!!! THANKS FOR SHARING THIS ONE!
Chicken Penne Casserole#2#0#Made this last night with a salad and garlic bread... Are you kidding me??? Fit for company. I will make this over and over, my picky kids loved it. Best thing when Ie was done it looked just like the picture my kids thought I was a genius....Thanks for making me a dinner Hero!!
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#I made this last night. I added 1/2 cup chopped mushrooms and a whole zuchinni, quartered lengthwise & sliced, and added a 8 ounce can of Hunt's Tomato Sauce. There were 3 of us and I barely have enough left for a lunch-size serving. Everyone couldn't stop raving about it!!! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Me and my mom are going to make this and i have a BIG feeling its going to be the best recipe we've made!!! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#We love this recipe and I make it often. It is also great left over.Dorothy also from Vernon
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Recipe was easy and a quick after work fix. Taste was good. Will definitely make a again.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#I used boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs. The sauce is really good and hubby said that this is a keeper!
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#My family really enjoyed this casserole! It gave a little different taste then the usual spaghetti or lasgana. I have five children and every one of them enjoyed this. I used chicken breast marinated in a garlic dressing instead of the thighs since I don't care for dark meat. Thanks for the great recipe! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#1#My husband and I both agreed that this dish was OK, but not fabulous. It's easy to make, but tastes a bit bland. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#aweseom, great flavor, changed a few things but that red pepper gives it a nice kick
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#This was very good and kid-friendly. My teen-agers had three helpings!
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#made this for the first time ever tonight to take to some friends house to eat. It was SUCH a HIT!!! Turned out great! I added a little more cheese than what it called for, because my family and i love cheese!! great receipe and cant wait to use it again!!!!
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#This recipe is a keeper , as my husband puts it. The only thing I did different was add some finely shredded carrots, to boost the nutritional value. This will be a recipe I make over and over. Linda B.S. California 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Good recipe! I used a can of crushed tomatoes with puree instead of processing diced tomatoes and paste.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#my family gobbled this right up i had 3/4 of jar of spaghetti sauce i used this in place of tomatoes and still added the extra herbs. delicious i will make this again. mum of three saginaw mi.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#I agree, the chicken penne casserole was good. Usually my husband does not like casseroles,but he liked this one.
Chicken Penne Casserole#1#0#I boil the chicken with carrots, onions, a?stalk of celery and garlic?then shred it. The chicken can be kept in the freezer until you need it for something like this dish. If you're using the chicken right away, use the broth instead of the canned stuff. 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Tried Chicken Penne Casserole for the first time today. It was so good. I will make this again soon.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#Had this casserole at my daughter-in-laws. Its a keeper.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#This looks like a GREAT casserole for church potlucks.? I'm always looking for new recipes.? Thanks!

Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#I made this for the first time tonight. I took some liberties and used a different pasta and didn't puree the tomatoes. My husband LOVED it - said it was the best thing I've cooked recently. I will definitely make this again! 
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#My family loves this, too.
Chicken Penne Casserole#0#0#This recipe is great! It's become a family favorite.

First-Place Coconut Macaroons#3#1#I dont like coconut. But I Love macaroons.. Go figure. I'm going to try this recipe! Thanks. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#25#21#I've been baking these macaroons for many years. Never once until today have I read that the whites should be whipped until stiff. Mine have always turned out perfectly just by using an manual egg whipper. I found that adding an additional 2-3 Tbls. of flour reduced the looseness of the batter. I personally like a cakier macaroon. I also use coconut extract instead of vanilla. That change made all the difference in a just so so cookie to a great one. A couple of Christmases I got a phone call from a complete stranger in P.A. who had eaten some of these macaroons I had sent to former neighbor of mine. She was calling to ask for my recipe! 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#24#7#I think that part of what makes this an inconsistent recipe is the nature of the coconut flakes themselves - you can get a lot of variation between different cup measurements because of the way they take up space. Rather than going by volume - I went by weight, using a single package that weighed 7 oz. With this, I scaled up the amount of each ingredient - 1/2 cup of sugar, 3 tablespoons of flour, 1/2 cup of sugar, 3/4ths tsp of vanilla, and three egg whites. The result was a puffy, toasty cookie that didn't spread. I had to bake it a bit longer at 325 as well - maybe set an 18-20 minute timer and check to see if the tops are toasty. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#2#I have made these twice. They taste divine, especially when warm, don't get me wrong, but both times they spread like crazy. I wanted to give these as a small treat to a client, (my family dog -sits) but they look ugly. Still delicious treat, but never make these for guests. I followed the recipe exactly. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#2#10#I made 5 dozen of these for a Christening. Instead of multiplying the recipe I did the same recipe 5 times and it made 5 different consistency cookies. I made no changes per batch. This is an inconsistent recipe. I would never recommend it for multiple dozen cookies, especially to be served on platter. But the taste is good.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#12#1#No question about it, this is the best macaroon recipe I've ever seen. Easy to prepare, easy to clean up, fabulous tasting. I've made this recipe twice and each time they've turned out great. Only one change - I used un sweetened shredded coconut to reduce the sugar content. By the way I discovered that the smaller the shred of the coconut, the better the consistency of the finished product. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#2#1#Only makes 7 cookies.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#2#2#1 and 1/3 c coconut is wrong
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#7#3#I think this recipe is perfect as is. I tried a batch just as instructed and a batch whipping the egg whites first. The batch with whipped egg whites may have looked a bit prettier, but were airy and crumbly, not nearly as good.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#59#19#At first, I made the recipe exactly as written. The flavor was great, but they spread a lot in the oven. The second time, I whipped the egg whites until fluffy and then gently folded in the remaining ingredients. No more spreading, and I was able to get more cookies out of the mixture. So yummy!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#15#0#I followed the recipe as it was written. Didn't whip the egg whites first. They are delicious! I'll be making them again.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#18#2#Followed the recipe exactly, and it made 12 delicious normal-sized macaroons. Will definitely make again!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#55#87#I never do these but I read the reviews and made the macaroons. It never ceases to amaze me how people can supposedly follow the same recipe with such different results. Toll house cookies being the prime example. Anyway, sorry, I did change it a little. I have made macaroons before and just wanted to experiment--however, I didn't change any measurements just tweaked things a little. I used almond flour, rum instead of vanilla, added some candied ginger and a dark chocolate button on top. They're fabulous but I mainly wanted to mention how they came together. They didn't but I piled them in heaps on the cookie sheet, anyway, and they're fine. Also, this recipe with no change in amounts on the ingredients, made 23 big macaroons. Macaroons are so rich and sweet and, basically unhealthy, most recipes don't recommend making them very big. Can't figure out how people could think the recipe doesn't make enough. Last of all, I think the freshness of the eggs makes a difference. Staler egg whites are watery. I could have used a little of that. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#26#7#I modified this recipe to a keto cookie substituting coconut flour and keto sugar. I whipped the egg whites to a peak added vanilla and folded in the other combined ingredients they turned out crisp and very good
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#76#18#I like the ingredients and portions, but this is how I put them together. In an upright mixer, beat the egg whites until they are stiff peaks, add vanilla. In another bowl, mix the other ingredients and fold them into the egg whites. I baked them on parchment paper and they were delicious 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#14#49#This recipe was poorly written. It does not state what temperature the oven should be at or that the whites need to be beaten until stiff white peaks form that information can only be found in the video which does not seem to be as easily accessible. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#13#1#This recipe was easy, fast, and so so delicious. If you follow it like the video, it comes out perfectly. I did not whip the eggs until stiff peaks, and it was perfect! I will probably double or triple the recipe because that was barley enough for our family of 4!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#10#5#This turned out perfectly! I whipped the egg whites until they were like styrofoam consistency and then added it to the rest of the dry ingredients. My normal cookie scoop didn't work to drop them on the cookie sheet so I'd use my hands to turn them into small rounds on the cookie sheet. I also didn't measure out the coconut. I just added the entire bag of coconut. I was being lazy to be honest! Any ways they turned out great and taste delicious! I think I'm going to drizzle them with chocolate before I serve them just too make them look a little more festive!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#10#1#I made these exactly as recipie states. I whipped the egg whites for just a couple minutes. It made 15 macaroons. Baked for 16 minutes My dad is a very harsh critic and a huge coconut fan. He said they were perfect.. So yes. This recipe is amazing. Thank you!!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#1#My husband and I loves these cookies. This time I'll try beating the egg whites to soft peak. Thanks for sharing. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#3#0#Thank you for sharing this recipe! The cookies were so good and easy to make!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#6#1#I actually tweaked this by whipping the egg whites to soft peaks before combining with dry ingredients. i also used coconut extract instead of vanilla & unsweetened shredded coconut (the finely shredded kind not the big flakes). they come soooo fluffy and delicious and just the right amount of sweetness!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#3#10#I made this. ..something wrong with this recipe. I didn't adjust. I prefer the Eagle brand milk recipe 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#2#3#I think that the coconut qty is 2-1/3 c? I used 14 oz. They are crispy so added 2 more egg whites. Seems recipe is off unless I am only making 1 dip? I made 24 macaroons.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#2#0#My husband loves these!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#2#0#I did a double batch and then a single one. I think single one were better! I would give 10* it's the best!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#4#0#I agree with Pixie. I whipped the egg whites to soft peak stage and used unsweetened toasted coconut and they were just right. Not too sweet!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#8#0#I made this recipe in two batches: one with whipping my egg whites into stiff peaks then combining. The next one without whipping my egg whites. The whipped egg white's batch turned out excellent! Crispier with a bit more depth. The non-whipped recipe still turned out tasty, however I found it comparable to a Mounds Candy Bar without the chocolate coating. I'm looking forward to trying this recipe with the traditional almond extract or maybe lemon! 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#10#1#My husband loves the chocolate dipped macaroons from Panera Bread. When I saw this recipe, I thought I'd make some for him for Father's Day. I only had unsweetened coconut on hand, so I used that. I made one other change, so the macaroons were more like the ones my husband loves. Once they cooled, I dipped the bottoms into melted chocolate, and when they set, I drizzled melted chocolate on top. They turned out beautifully! My husband said they were even better than Panera Bread's! Definitely a win! Thank you for such a yummy and simple recipe. :-) 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#2#0#I've made these several times with Bob's RedMill 1-to-1 gluten-free baking flour. I didn't do anything but what the recipe said, and they came out well. They remind me of my Grandmother's macaroons. I try to get them into a ball shape on the cookie sheet because any spread will brown much more than the rest of the cookie--the dough is quite loose in uncooked state. They are very sweet--but I like that. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#1#Fantastic! I used lemon extract instead of vanilla and whipped the egg whites briefly till frothy, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. In 19-1/2 minutes the macaroons were done and amazing. I'll definitely be making them again. Thank you!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#6#1#I purchased unsweetened coconut at the grocery yesterday and came across this recipe this morning. I tweaked it slightly to be keto friendly by using almond flour instead of regular flour, and stevia instead of sugar. I also used lemon extract instead of vanilla, as I am a huge lemon fan and just happened to have it on hand. They turned out absolutely beautiful and so delicious!!!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#1#Great taste and smell. A bit too sweet for me, so I'd cut the sugar down. Also was a runny mess. Will need to add a little more flour and coconut, but plan to make again!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#2#0#I made these macaroons last Sunday. They were excellent!! I did not need to whip the egg whites, I followed the recipe, as is, and the macaroons turned out beautifully. A very particular relative loved them and asked for the recipe. For gluten free, can I substitute the flour with cornstarch or tapioca? If yes, what would be the quantity? Thank you for sharing your gifts and talents with so many of us!!!!!!!!!! Happy Mother's Day!! 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#2#1#I am already making my fourth batch. They are delicious and I did not need to put the vanilla extract. I tried it with and without and they were delicious both ways. They only make a small batch though, so I would suggest making a double batch because they are so delicious
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#3#2#Super simple and delicious. I followed the recipe/directions to a T and they turned out perfectly. You literally drop a spoonful of the batter to make a cookie. There is no secret method to doing this. They are not as crisp on the top the following day (after being stored in air tight container) but are still absolutely delicious. Make sure your eggs are room temp!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#4#They taste great but I dont understand how to get the perfect shape. So I just the whole batter into the pan.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#2#0#Just made them-- I added 2 tbsp of almond flour, 3/4 sweetened coconut and 1/4 unsweetened, vanilla and almond extract I let the mix sit for 10 minutes and scooped them in baking cups for a uniform shape
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#4#1#I doubled the recipe, used fine almond flour instead of wheat, used unsweetened coconut and cut back the sugar a bit, beat the egg whites a little and baked on parchment paper at 340 for 15 minutes. They were golden but really sticky. Who cares. When husband pronounces them spectacular you have a winner. Next time I'll beat the whites longer with some cream of tartar and bake at the original temp so they can go a touch longer. And grease the parchment paper, although nibbling the stuck bits off was the baker's reward. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#They turned out delicious! I didn't have vanilla extract so I used vanilla almond coffee creamer and it worked like a charm. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#The texture and taste came out perfect. I only had unsweetened coconut so I added just a tad more sugar and also added chocolate chips. My family inhaled them and asked me to make them again. So easy!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#2#The taste was pretty good, but the texture and final look didn't at all match the picture. There's not enough coconut in this recipe relative to the egg whites. It turned into a puddle of mess when baking. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#OMG Made these tonight. Super yummy, super fast
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#4#0#Perfection! Amazing flavor and texture. These would be a really yummy treat with a cup of coffee or tea. Definitely a keeper.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#2#0#excellent fast recipe....husband really likes it and it makes a perfect batch for 2 people
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#This is my new go to macaroon recipe. After trying this new recipe and the raves on this cookie, I threw my old recipe away. Very easy to make. A chocolate drizzle is very tasty also. The white chocolate can be tinted for the various holidays.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Turned out perfect
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#2#0#I too was sceptical when I read the directions, but was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. I bake in Germany, so have two differences: I used unsweeteed DRY coconut, and I bake on parchment. The mix was not overly sticky, so I could form small balls instead of using two spoons (probably due to the low moisture content of the coconut). They baked like a charm. I got 15 cookies from this recipe. I took them to my first Holiday party with my new company, and my boss inhaled them. She said that I can keep my job :) Will try dipping the bottoms in chocolate next time (as suggested by previous contributor), ran out of time this batch. A very simple way to use up leftover egg whites, which have a habit of collecting in my refrigerator.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#1#These are good macaroons....however, you need to beat egg white until frothy with solid peaks....add cream of tartar to make whites turn out better, add sugar and vanilla to whites and THEN add to coconut mixture. Bake at 350° not 325°. Also, bake for 18 minutes not 10!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#1#Turned into melted puddles in the oven. I had the sneaking feeling the egg whites should be whipped, and then sugar added, etc. But I followed the video and written instructions to the letter and just ended up with a pile of coconut and the'cookie' part bled out all over the cookie sheet like a pool of water. How did you guys make this recipe work? I'm so curious because there are many positive reviews - would like to know how to fix it. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Think I'll try these, sounds yummy 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#Excellent macaroons! I love sweets. They were delicious. Thanks for the recipe.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#1#This is my second review and it still gets five stars! My husband has digestive issues, and all it takes is two macaroons a day to help him out. This recipe is quick and simple and makes just a small batch, about 9 to 12 cookies, which is perfect. Thanks for sharing!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#11#Terrible. Not sweet at all, not crisp, generally repugnant and a waste of my time and ingredients.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#DIP BOTTOMS IN CHOCOLATE
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#1#Came out perfectly! I used parchment paper, cooled them for a minute or two before transferring to a cooling rack, and there was no sticking at all. I got 13 small cookies from this recipe - I'll probably double it next time just so there's plenty. Quick and reliable....will be a'go to' recipe for sure! 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#10#I have no idea how these won first place.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#3#These turned out awesome! I followed recipe but substituted sweetened coconut for unsweetened coconut, and all purpose flour for gluten free flour (due to an allergy). I added a couple drops of water to the unsweetened coconut like another reviewer suggested and also whipped the egg whites. I had to increase cooking time about 5 minutes in order for them to be golden but when they finished they came out delicious! Will definitely be making again :)
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#3#1#These are EXCEPTIONAL. Just perfect. I used Organic UNSWEETENED coconut flakes (trader joe's), and used 1/3 cup sugar with an extra small teaspoon since the coconut was unsweetened. Since my coconut flakes were extremely dry I just added a couple of drops (literally) of water and crushed the flakes a bit more/ tossing and softening them just a bit before adding everything else. My egg whites were cold not room temperature (i was impatient ha) and I whisked them with them with the vanilla. They were absolutely AMAZING - perfectly crisp on the outside and perfectly light and yet moist on the inside. DELICIOUS! DEFINITELY DESERVED YOUR BLUE RIBBON AWARD AT THE FAIR!!! Thank you for posting this! 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#Totally forgot to whip the eggs but it turned out great anyway! Exactly like the picture!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#2#0#I've made this recipe exactly as written, both without and with whipping the egg whites (to soft peak). The results are great either way. Whipped whites naturally give the macaroons a lighter and airier texture, versus being denser and chewier (my preference) when not whipped. If you can't be bothered, or if you just want a denser texture, don't whip the whites and the cookies will be just fine. Despite the pedantic naysaying of the pedantic naysayers. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#Aside from doubling the measurements, I followed this recipe EXACTLY as written. From the room-temp (71 degrees Fahrenheit), un-whipped egg whites to the rounded teaspoons, I didn't change a thing. I needed to bake them about 25 minutes to get a bit of golden color, but they came out EXACTLY as pictured and described. I have 36 beautiful and delicious macaroons to take to an event this evening. I will definitely come back to this recipe. I found these to be a little *too* sweet for my taste, so I'll try it with less sugar next time. But I wanted to let others know that there is NO NEED to bother with whipping the egg whites. I had a little trouble getting them off the first pan, but I think that's because I let them cool a little before transferring them to a wire rack. For the second pan, I transferred them as soon as they came out of the oven, and it was no trouble at all. I don't know if it's because they were still hot and soft or because it was a different type of pan, but I'll transfer them immediately from now on. GREAT RECIPE! 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#Perfect and one of my all time favorites. No one sells them anymore, but where I live there isn't a proper butcher shop, deli or bakery. These are easy to make and I beat or whip the egg whites first, mix the other ingredients and fold in the whipped egg whites. People are polarized, they either love coconut or they don't, luckily my group loves them as much as I do. And a simple, quick recipe too. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#4#0#I lived in a small town in NJ when I was a child. A quaint little place, there was one butcher's shop with sawdust on the floor and one bakery that had the most glorious display of goodies. Of all their creations, I loved the macaroons the best. Some memories never go away - you brought me back to the 1950s.. thank you. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#These are very good. I quadrupled the recipe, as it doesn't make very many, but only used 7 egg whites and they were easier to bake and kept their form. We like ours with a cherry on top and the bottom dipped in chocolate, but they are good just plain also. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#I made it just as is, and did NOT whip the egg whites. Turned out delicious. They spread a bit on the bottom, but I'm thinking if I would have beaten the egg whites, they would of held their form better. I put spoonful's on plain parchment paper on a Pampered Chef baking stone and they came off easily. Whipped or not whipped, I think they are awesome. Next time I will try whipping them. They made one dozen cookies for me. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Good recipe. Anyone whose ever made these kinds of cookies knows you need to whip the egg whites. Unsure why people get mad about that. I made it Keto style with unsweetened coconut, coconut flour and stevia. Came out just like your photo and they taste great. Thank you for the recipe!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Just made these for the first time...wow!! FanTASTIC!! I can tell I'll quadruple the recipe...and NEVER buy them again!! May 4th...have made them 3 times...now ready to make a quadruple batch. You DO NOT need to whip the whites! I use unsweetened flakes, but organic sugar. I take Ghirardelli choc, melt it with a tad of oconut oil...dip the bottoms, and drizzle on top...everyone loves them!! 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#This would be great if you edited to include whipping the egg whites! Otherwise it doesn't work at all. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#These were perfect . If you like coconut , you'll love these . It's a great Passover desert because it has no leaven . My only complaint is it has too many calories. Lol . I would like to eat the whole batch , but I have to have a little discipline. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#A tiny bit sweeter than I prefer and doesn't make nearly enough. Will make again and will try dipping the bottoms in chocolate although that will probably mean they will all be eaten at once! Yummy.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#I wish I could show you a picture of how beautiful these came out! Followed the recipe exactly using large eggs, not XL, and decided to just do an even dozen. They baked for 24 minutes at 325?F. They smell amazing and taste is so good!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#I don't know what I did wrong but these did not turn out very well. Used sweetened flaked coconut instead of the shredded and extra large egg whites because that's what I had on hand. They spread out (bottom of cookie) on the baking sheet and were impossible to get off the GREASED baking sheet. Maybe too much egg white? Anyone else have this problem? Good taste, though! 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Just a doubt about the egg whites: are they beaten?
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#I've never made macaroons before. And I made these twice in 24 hours. I have a couple of cookie events coming up and had co-workers try them. They raved about them. I did cut the sugar drastically, only because I dipped them in chocolate, which added a lot of sweetness. Congrats on your blue ribbon!! 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#This is an accurate review. Made exactly as recipe was written. 5 stars!!!! Super easy to make and a fabulous tasting macaroon.This one is a keeper!!!!Thank you so much for this recipe. I can see why you won 1st place.Awesome!!!!TamileeR
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#First off, if you follow the recipe EXACTLY like it's stated, your cookies will turn out perfectly. This was the first time I have ever made coconut macaroon cookies, and it will definitely NOT be the last! Couldn't ask for a better recipe. THANK YOU for sharing!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#Sitting here munching on one, these are fantastic, so glad I didn't use the recipe with the condensed milk, these are perfect, not too sweet. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#These macaroons turned out great, my family and co-workers loved them when I took them to work.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#This is great and easy! It tastes very similar to what we used to get a long time ago from a restaurant. I will definitely do it again, and probably fix five times as much! ! This will be a recipe that is made often....perfect with a cup of coffee! ( and egg whites were not beaten before mixing it together. )
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#this is a keeper, they are soooooo good
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#I am not reviewing this recipe yet, and I hope to make these soon, but in looking at the reviews I want to know are the egg whites supposed to whipped to soft peaks before mixing with the other ingredients. Please help!!!!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Hi Elsvgs,Store these at room temperature for a couple days or keep them in the refrigerator up to a week.Hope that helps!Sue StetzelTaste of Home Magazine
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#How to store the macaroons and what is the shelf life ?
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#some recipes call for condensed milk and are too sweet. This recipe is perfect. Light and the coconut flavor wins out!!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Really easy to make and taste great. After I made the first batch my husband looked at me and said can you make more? He wanted less sugar in it this time cause he said it was too sweet.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#Yummy and supper easy to make. Will definitely make this recipe again!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#Super easy! I melted semi sweet chocolate chips in microwave, then dipped bottoms of macaroons after they cooled.. Beautiful and taste like Mounds candy, but in a cookie.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#The first time I made this recipe It didn't come out too well then I discovered that the recipe has omitted a step. You have to beat the egg whites to a soft peak before you add them to the coconut, then the recipe came out great. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#These are a favorite of my 9 year old son (I use less sugar for him, he still loves them!).
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#These came out perfect. They did not run, I even whipped the egg whites not knowing not to. I did use a silpat liner on my pan maybe that's why they didn't run? They are lovely morsels!! I did only get 14 cookies though. Will double next time. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#2#These were too sweet for me.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#1#Anyone looking for something quick and easy to do with those 2 yolks? Whisk them in a microwave-safe bowl, add a tiny drop or two of cooking sherry (optional) a knob of butter, a tbls or two of milk, whisk and microwave for 30 seconds; whisk again and microwave for another 15-20 seconds until the desired consistency is reached. On two halves of toasted, buttered muffin or bagel that makes a terrific breakfast or lunch for one. I've done it - you'll like it.The macaroons, by the way, are perfect and so quick and easy to make, I'll be having that scrambled egg with 2 yolks often. ? 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#These were awesome:)
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#These were great! I made them bigger than teaspoons and used rice flour to make them gluten free. They were so easy and tasty I am sure I will be making these again and again!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#This is definitely a first place macaroon recipe. It has the best color, taste, and consistency of all I have tried; including the one on the coconut bag. One addition I make is to sub in a almond extract (just because I like that flavor); 3/4 vanilla extract and 1/4 almond extract. It also works just fine to use cooking spray instead of Crisco to grease your cookie sheets. I quadrupled the recipe and it made 65 macaroons - using a teaspoon measure to scoop each serving. I live at high altitude in Denver and did not need to do any substitutions.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Lovely recipe... the ingredients aren't enough for the amount that it says they should yield. I doubled the recipe in hopes of having a full dessert. I ended up with 18 decent sized macaroons. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Watch the size egg you use! After I mixed all ingredients, the batter was very runny. I noticed I had used jumbo eggs (that's all we had at the time). The recipe does not say what size eggs to use, but obviously not jumbo. I added more coconut to the runny batter and the macaroons turned out great. Next time, I'll use smaller eggs. Perhaps some clarification on the size of eggs to use would help. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Followed directions, as written, and everything turned out perfectly! We dipped them in chocolate ganache To add to the yum! Will make them again and again!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#These cookies are absolutely delicious! They are extremely easy to make on a moments notice. I like to half dip them in Wilton microwavable chocolate. Everyone loves them and they look beautiful as well.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Worked out perfect as is, I used shredded coconut, as that is what I had. I did microwave a couple handfuls of chocolate chips checking at 20 sec intrivals and stirring until just melted. Than dipped some of the maccaroons and places them on parchment. Tried to let them cool, but we ate them before that could happen. They are delis with or without chocolate. I would recommend using less sugar if your coconut is sweetened, or you are using lots of chocolate.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#These cookies were easy to make and tasted good too. They turned out perfectly. Some of the reviews said they were runny. Mine were not. However, if egg whites stand too long, they do get runny. Maybe these cookies were mixed up, but not baked right away?
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#these were delicious and very easy ....and to those who complain...I followed the receipt to the tee and had wonderful results....I find that when u change something then yu are bound to have something go wrong.....
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Best Macaroons Ever!Found these in my TOH Cookbook and decided to make them for my BF as part of an anniversary gift (he sees baking for someone as a real declaration of love). He and everyone else who has had any has told me they were the best they'd ever tasted. Even my roommate, who doesn't like coconut, loves them!The store bought ones don't even rate compared to these.Must Try! 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Easy and wonderful recipe. Its number one in my book!!!!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Good Recipe, follow recipe exactly and it works! Ladyreader, this is to rate the recipe and to help other cooks decide whether to use the recipe or not. This rating system should not be used to correct spelling and grammar, unless it effects the recipe. Not helpful and unfair to the recipe rating.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Really good and easy. I added chopped almonds and dipped the tops in chocolate. They were like Almond Joys.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#2#Clicking on one star just so that TOH can correct something in the comment by the submitter of this recipe. As a resident of Wisconsin, the correct spelling of the town Betty lives in should end with an o , thus, Shawano. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Awesome recipe!!!!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#I have made these several times and they are a hit every time. They are so easy to make and only once did I have to add an extra egg white and that could have been due to small eggs.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Simple and delicious
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#As a food blogger, my number one pet peeve is when somebody butchers my recipe by not following instructions and adding and substituting and then comes onto my blog and leaves a negative comment when it doesn't turn out.If you follow this recipe exactly as written, and don't beat the egg whites, and don't add nuts and substitute things, it comes out five stars- a perfect macaroon.I will say that I don't know in what alternate universe this makes 12 macaroons, because I doubled the recipe and still only got 10 out of it.A real winner though, and I will make again. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Crispy little bites of deliciousness!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#My family really enjoyed these. In fact I dipped them in Nutella and it was a HUGE hit! I did want to say to fluff the egg whites until there are peaks, pour in the vanilla, mix some more then fold in the egg whites. NO running...at all! They were absolutely delicious.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Almost Perfect recipe.. I made once the eggs ran. second time I used one egg white, half the amount of sugar and one more tablespoon of flour and ohh were they so perfect we gobbled them up immediately. Thanks for the recipe!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#OMG I had very high expectations and these cookies exceeded them. I've never made macaroons before and my absolute favorites are sold at Julienne's Restaurant. I made this recipe exactly as stated and they were perfect. I did use parchment paper as recommended. I also lightly beated the egg whites and vanilla to just blend, then added them to the dry coconut mixture. I used a cookie scooper that a friend gave me many years ago and the size was perfect, yielding exactly 9 cookies like the recipe states. The egg whites never ran. I did leave the cookies in the oven for an extra 3-5 minutes until they were more golden but not burnt. Oh, the cookie scooper measures appx. 1 measuring tablespoon. I loved them and will add to my recipe keepers! 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#The egg mixture ran all over the pan with the first batch - made just as instructed. The second batch I beat the egg whites until frothy and then added an additional Tbsp of flour - they ran less, but they still ran. I think I'll try a different recipe next time. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#great macaroons and so easy. Just make sure that you use parchment paper with these or they will run and stick.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#1#Too eggy, egg runs to center of Pan ,solution,only use unfrozen coconut,remove 1 egg, add a bit of condensed milk, .
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#I've made this twice and here's how I like it: I doubled everything except the sugar and made larger cookies (24 from a double recipe). And I baked them only 14 minutes. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Just made a batch of these for my kids and I. I added some cocoa to some of them. They are all excellent. Thanks for the recipe.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#These were so simple to make and SO delicious. I will probably try adding some slivered almonds or drizzling some chocolate on top next time to dress them up a little. But they are fantastic even with out!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#A great, simple recipe with very tasty results. I used the original recipe the first time I made them and they were a little eggy for us. I used 1 egg white and 1/4 a cup of sugar the second time and they came out just as good, so if you're looking to cut back on the sugar that's a good option. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#very quick and easy. Very delicious
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#based on the other ratings i will give you 5 stars lol. i was just wondering if the coconut should be sweetened or unsweetened, i am guessing that it is unsweetened on the fact that there is sugar in the recipe but i wanted to make 100% sure, thanks
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Very easy to make and was very good. This is a keeper.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#These are very moist and delicious! My husband loves them and he's not even a huge fan of coconut! I used a mini cupcake pan to ensure that the egg white did not run out of the coconut and they came out perfect!!! A little red and green sugar gave them a pretty holiday look. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#The cookies came out perfectly. They were fast, and looked very pretty. However, for my own gluttonous and rather bruttish tastes (giggle) I wanted them a little sweeter and a bit more moist (this would probably mean adding some fat like condensed milk). They ARE delicious, though. I'll make them again and I probably won't change a thing since it was so easy and it saves adding more fat. Thank you! 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#I have had store bought macaroons here and there-I am 48 years old and never made them before-I found this recipe -EXCELLENT and so easy to make- one batch got a bit browner, and it was still amazingly good. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#I was looking for a quick and easy yet delicious macaroon recipe and I found it. My husband loved it! I followed the recipe to the letter and all I can say is I will have to double the recipe next time, just not enough with 1 batch!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Just made this for a church event. I have already been contacted by 3 people for the recipe. Double the recipe, it is that good! I made as directed except I started by beating the egg whites a bit then added all the other ingredients one at a time, ending with the coconut. I used almond extract instead. I used two teaspoons to drop and form the small mounds on parchment paper instead of greasing the pans. At 20 minutes they were perfect! Thanks for a recipe I am proud to share.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Quick & easy to make. In my over they were done in 15 mins. Lightly browned & crunchy on the outside & soft & chewy on the inside. I combined the mixture in the bowl using a fork. Instead of using a teaspoon to drop cookies onto baking sheet, I used 1/2 tablespoon instead. The cookies came out a nice size. I cooked the cookies on parchment paper. These cookies are delicious.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#I followed this recipe exactly as instructed. I didn't beat the egg whites. I didn't add chocolate or pecans or any other bells and whistles. The macaroons were crunchy around the edges, fluffy and moist on the inside and simply delicious. I mixed everything rapidly in a little bowl, by hand, and popped the dollops into the oven for 20 minutes. Hey presto! Macaroons that would give Earth Fare's a run for their money. My husband loved them. Thank you so much for sharing this -- you deserve that first-place ribbon. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Easy & good. I did whip the egg whites. I got 1 dz. Ping pong ball size macaroons.
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Such an easy recipe and without condensed milk, it's a snap! I added an extra TBSP of flour to avoid the liquid spreading at the bottom. They are PERFECT! This is my new'go to' recipe! 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#These were lovely, I made a batch for my sewing group, they love macaroons and they said that they were wonderful. My husband hates coconut and he ate 3. Would make again for any one who loves coconut. Sent the recipe to my sister and best friend. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#This is the recipe I've been looking for as mcheleclow has said don't need concensed milk. Very goood. By the way the batch does need to be doubled when you cook the recipe. The first batch I cook as according to the recipe they were excellent but the egg white seem to run out of the cookie. The next batch I beat the egg white slightly and added a little coconut flavoring alone with the vanilla. They came out perfect and tasted a little better. This is a delicious cookie. The first batch I removed from the oven 1 hour ago and my husband has eaten almost half of the first batch. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#These were so, so delicious, but even though I doubled the recipe, it only made 13 (I did drop them bigger then a tsp) and they had to cook at least 10 min. longer. I used this recipe because it didn't call for sweetened condensed milk. I guess next time I'll have to double it again. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#This was a quick and easy recipe and absolutely delicious! I will absolutely make this recipe again!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#Note: the picture shows the macaroons as much larger than the suggested rounded teaspoonful. I didn't much care for such small macaroons. So, when I make them again, they will be closer to the size indicated in the photograph.However, they tasted great! I have no problem with the flavor. 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#This recipe didn't call for pecans?? 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#These were awesome...just the right amount of crispiness on the outside and chewiness on the inside. *I omitted the pecans because I didnt have any and they were still delicious. *Didn't beat the egg whites. I think the recipe size was perfect! If you are someone who tracks your portion sizes then this recipe will make more than enough :) 
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#I found this in TOH Ultimate cookie collection cookbook. (pg 81). THESE ARE FANTASTIC! the ONLY thing i do a lil different is i add some chopped pecans to them mix before baking! AWESOME WITH OR WITHOUT. so soft and moist! i noticed another reader asked, and i will say i did NOT beat my eggwhites previous to putting them in the bowl. i simply mixed it EXACTLY how the directions say. i used medium speed on a stand mixer for a couple minutes till it looked good. if you let the mix sit for too long, though, make sure you stir it before spooning them out as the sugar and liquid tends to sit on the bottom of the bowl. also, my cookies did have some liquid spreading but it was GOOD STUFF. i baked them till they were VERY lightly brown on top and golden brown at the very bottom edge. i used parchment paper and never greased it once, and used it for a quadruple batch... as i make my cookies bigger than everyone else, i found this recipe didnt make many cookes. MY NEWEST MACAROON RECIPE AND ITS A FOREVER KEEPER!
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#1#0#Are the egg whites beaten?
First-Place Coconut Macaroons#0#0#CAN I USE DESICCATED COCONUT INSTEAD OF FLAKED COCONUT?
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I definitely don't recommend this recipe without some serious tweaking. The ratio of potatoes/bacon to sour cream/cheese is ridiculous. This might be good if you doubled the potatoes and halved the dairy or added a ton of other ingredients to cut down on the richness but otherwise it's nearly inedible. I made it entirely as directed. Total bust.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#4#1#I love this recipe because baked potatoes are so versatile. I tweaked it to make it a meal. Cooked the potatoes in the crockpot while at work. I added cubed ham and used cheddar-jack cheese. We added the sour cream and chives after baking. It was a satisfying meal that was so easy! I hope the remainder freezes well, since we are empty nesters.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#6#0#Making this today as I have all ingredients , think I'll half it though as it's just the 2 of us-think hubby will love it
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#6#0#So good. Used mini potatoes and just parboiled them first.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#7#0#I did increase the potatoes and decreased the sour cream. Other than that, love that I can make this the night before and pop it in the oven the day I'm serving it. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#5#1#I've never tried this, but it sounds soooo good. I'm going to make it tonight as a test run before the holidays are on us. Thanks for the idea. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#16#3#I love twice baked potatoes so this casserole is definitely one I'll try. I know ahead of time that I won't use the amount of sour cream called for due to past experience of the overpowering taste when I've made twice baked potatoes. My solution to that is to substitute French Onion chip dip for a portion of the sour cream. Not only does it eliminate the sour cream aftertaste but it adds a nice flavor to the potatoes! It's a simple, easy solution. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#4#3#Can you boil the potatoes ahead of time? Or how long are the potatoes supposed to be baked ahead of time?
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#6#3#I've made this many times and agree with a previous commenter, the amount of potato has been changed. I use russets (well scrubbed with skins left on) because I prefer a starchy potato for this dish and use about 3 lbs. We get about 8 decent sized portions. Skimpy portions are not permitted in my kitchen. I prefer to cube the potatoes and roast them in a large baking dish before hand. I also double the amount of salt and black pepper to 1/2 tsp. Twice baked potatoes are a favorite of both my husband and me and this casserole hits the spot. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#3#4#I have made this recipe several times, exactly as it states. To the peoplethat don't approve of this recipe, all I can say is that you much not likea loaded potato. This is simply a huge loaded potato. It's wonderful.If you don't have enough potato, choose larger potatoes. My potatoesare probably med/lg. If you haven't tried the recipe, you might besurprised to find out that all the ingredients really work. Try it ! ! !Thanks Taste of Home, you do a great job! ! ! ! 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#4#1#I first made this recipe several years ago. The version I printed back then simply stated 6 medium potatoes . When converting my recipes from paper to electronic, I noticed the potato type and quantity has changed, now being 1 1/2 lbs red potatoes. 6 medium russet potatoes are definitely different in mass to 1 1/2 lbs red potatoes! I did try and the red potato quantity is certainly not sufficient for the quantity of other ingredients in the recipe. If quantities are balanced more appropriately, recipe is wonderful! 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#1#3#bwilkin-I agree with you 100%. today at Albertsons I bought a 10lb bag of potatoes &gt; holidays needs on sale. if you do the math waaaay to much extra stuff not near enough potato ratio. I actually thought it was a misprint.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#7#2#If the reviewer thinks this is vile, then it isn't a review is it?? It's a recipe that is a treat, not something one would prepare every day. It's like a loaded baked potato on a grand scale. Perhaps the person who thinks this is vile, should go to a more mundane food website...one for people who are afraid of food. It's all in how moderate you are. BTW, my preference was to cut back a little on the sour cream and cheese. I eliminated the mozzarella and used cheddar and jack, added a little garlic powder and chives. It was great with steak tips and green beans with mushrooms. This is a bona fide review because i actually made it. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#25#This sounds vile. No way I'll try this. Taste of Home you REALLY missed the mark on choosing this as your Recipe Of The Day . 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#2#2#What a disappointment this dish was. I love potatoes and could not wait to try this. Too much sour cream and cheese for our tastes. Wish I had only made half the recipe to try it. You cant even taste the potatoes that well. Made as directed except for the green onions, omitted them. Won't be making this one again. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#2#0#A great dish without all the work. Made it for potluck and it was gone before I knew it.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#1#0#Every time I make this my mother-in-law tries to lick the pan! So very good!!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#1#1#I have to agree with the other reviews...way too much sour cream, cheese and bacon. One cup each of sour cream and both cheeses and 4-6 slices of bacon is better in proportion to the potatoes.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#1#I didn't read views first but knew that ratios were off. I halved the bacon, cheeses and sour cream to the 1 1/2 lbs of potatoes, used oval baker smaller than 9x13. Very yummy but maybe still less sour cream. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#2#i done ALOT of changes to fit my weird eating habits... I mixed the salt & black pepper 2gether - so it measured out to 1/4t - I used low sodium bacon bits or crumbles - used a Mexican blend of cheeses - added red & green bell peppers diced - and added the bottom 1/2's of the green onions to the casserole - sprinkled more of the green onions toppings to the potatoes... EVERY1 loved it! will b making it again... for sure! 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#2#0#My husband and I were looking for a good potato recipe, and we stumbled upon this one. Initially, our first thought was, it makes too much for our little family of two, so we decided to cut the recipe in half. It sounded delicious.Once it came out of the oven, that was a different story. The amount of bacon coupled with the sour cream overpowers the dish, so the balance of flavors is too rich. Because the potatoes are such a neutral flavor, they get lost in the casserole. Maybe if you use less of the sour cream and bacon, or more potatoes, that would be the right ratio of bacon to toppings. Also, the presentation wasn't very appealing, because the whiteness of the sour cream dominates the other colors.Sadly, this recipe will not be added to our recipe box. Happy cooking! :) 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#As I'm not eating meat at the moment, I substituted the bacon for salmon flakes. Worked a treat! 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#3#0#Before I made this I read all the reviews. Based on those I added 3 large potatoes and cut the quantity of sour cream in half. The dish was perfect with those changes.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Very good. I didn't read the reviews first, bad decision. I was in a bind with little time and not enough potatoes to fill the bottom of a 9x13 - in first layer. I quickly made some instant potatoes (not something I would make for Christmas Eve but was in a bind). I mixed with the baked potatoes. Turned out great!! 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#1#0#Family loved it--had to add it to the recipe box immediately!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#1#1#Awesome recipe, but listen to the reviewers that made modifications. I doubled the amount of potatoes and only used 2 cups of sour cream and it turned out great, but if I make it again, I'll cut back on the sour cream even more. It tasted wonderful though and everyone loved it! 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#2#0#Very good Recipe! Very easy to make and was delicious! Needed more than 6 potatoes for a 13 X 9 pan . I ended up using 8 or 9 medium size...which and was over 2 lbs.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#1#0#Very pretty dish, very delicious! The mixture of cheeses, bacon and green onions can't be beat! 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Excellent recipe, but I missed the fact that the potatoes needed to be already baked before assembling the casserole. Mine turned out tasty but potatoes were still very under-cooked, even after adding 20 minutes to the cooking time. Needless to say, I'll have to try this again! 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Great side Dish! I adjusted some sour cream but I added some butter. Definitely will be made again soon
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I made this for my in-laws one night for supper. Wow! They loved it! My husband said make sure you make it again... It really is a great tasting potato recipe. Love it!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#This is one of those recipes you better only make for people you like. It's amazingly delicious, and whomever you make it for will keep coming back for more! Cheesy, goodness with bacon and onions too. What's not to love? It's a great one for grilled meals in the summer, goes well with steak or chicken and feeds a crowd too! 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#1#0#For all of you who loved this recipe but hated the prep time, put your potatoes in a plastic grocery bag, tie it loosely and microwave. I'd say about 10 to 15 minute for 6 large baking potatoes or 10 minutes for 6 medium red potatoes. Check them half way through so you don't over cook and adjust time accordingly. You can do this the day before and just stick them in the frig till your ready to make your casserole. This is what I did for this recipe. Love the recipe and this will be a keeper. Thank you 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#This was good, but too rich for our tastes. If I make it again, I'd try using less sour cream. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner. I asked how does it taste and my husband said Awesome ! I baked the red potatoes for 35 minutes on 350 degrees and used 1/2 the amount of cheese. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#My husband I liked this recipe it was a nice change of pace I did tweek it a little half the sour cream 7 slices of bacon 1 cup moss cheese and 2 cups chedder. thanks for sharing.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Excellent! My husband & I really enjoyed this casserole. I had baked potatoes in frig so it only took a few mins. to heat up!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#This casserole was easy to make and very good - the flavors were great - I would definitely make it again!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Love this recipe! Making it for a 4th of July picnic.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I made this for a pot luck at work...it was the first to go!! Yummy is all I heard for the rest of the day! Will make again.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I tried this recipe out for my extended family and they loved it! Now they are asking for the recipe. I did add a little extra potatoes to the mixture, but wouldn't change anything else about it. It was awesome :-) 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I used the entire amt of potatoes but cut everything else in half. It worked out great! I also used a 7x11 pan. Definite hit!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I made this recipe as is. When my boyfriend saw the dish for just two of us, he asked if he should invite the neighbors. By the time we finished there was not enough left for the neighbors. It was so good! I like to try a lot of different recipes, but this is one that my boyfriend has requested that I make again.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I doubled the amount of potatoes and then cut the original amount of everything else by 1/3 and we loved them. However, my husband wants me to make them according to the recipe the next time!!! Either way, we will be making them again!!!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#1#1#Great recipe. Look folks, good tasting food is fattening. Otherwise it wouldn't taste good! Make your own adjustments, but don't bash the original recipe, the ingredients are there for a reason. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Just made half recipe and I would do it again. It was easy and quick. I did run out of sour cream but used french onion chip dip to make up the balance I needed to complete the amount of sour cream needed. I did delete the onion because of this. The flavor was spot on.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#We loved it! It was worthy of leftovers, and I dread having leftovers.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I wasn't sure how the family would like the new recipe so made a pan of the old cheesy potatoes and one of this recipe. It was superb! Everyone liked it. I use the suggestion to simplify it by using frozen diced hash browns, and used only 2 1/2 cups sour cream. I used the precooked bacon, and it was wonderful. Saved me lots of time and both kinds of energy - mine and the electrical type! 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Way too much fat, the potatoes even got lost in the heavy mixture of fat.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Excellent! We doubled the potatoes and left everything else the same and it was perfect.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Made it for a family get together. Casserole did not last very long. The men loved it.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Have been making this dish for our Christmas gathering for a number of years now. Everyone loves it! So easy too!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Used the original recipe of using baking potatoes and loved it. Served this at my son's wedding reception, it was a hugh hit. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#This recipe is good like it is or can switch it around a little by using the ranch dressing already mentioned. Also, the potatoes can be cut up and boiled then drained and dried off with paper towel. It would be quicker than baking them.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#While this recipe was a smash hit with me & my family, i would definitely have to say it's miscatagorized. There's nothing quick about this quick dinner recipe. I mean for real, who just has 6 medium potatoes laying around already baked?! And cutting them into 1 cubes once they are baked is next to impossible. So before they even went into the oven to cook as a casserole, i'd already spent nearly an hour on what was supposed to be a 15 min. prep time. Had my boys not told me how great it was & what an awesome cook i am & it actually taste REALLY good, i don't know if i'd even have made it again. Good thing my main dish could be re-heated in the microwave or it'd have been super cold by the time this was done. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Yes the first ingredient is 1-1/2 pounds red potatoes (about 6 medium), baked
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Do I cook the potatos before mixing this all together??
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I've made this a few times now and everyone has loved it!!! I didn't use as much sour cream as it called for because it seemed a little much. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#WOW!!! Everyone couldn't stop talking about this dish. I used 8 oz light sour cream and lowfat cheese and it was terrific. It reminded people of Outback's cheesy fries. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Delicious! I only used 6 slices of bacon, and not all of the sour cream cheese mixture, but it was fantastic and my guests all asked for the recipe.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I used ranch dressing in place of the sour cream. The family loved it!!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#1#i'm a little clueless, newish to the whole real cooking thing. how long do i bake the potatoes before making this? 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#haven't tried this recipe yet, but was wondering if i can use bacon crumbles instead of cooked bacon, and if so how much? 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Amazing casserole.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Yum! Tastes like a loaded baked potato. I used a 3lb. bag of potatoes and 2 cups sour cream and liked the result! Also added green onions to the first layer as well as topping with them at the end. Will make again!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I followed the tips of other reviews and used the entire 3#bag of potato's and used only 12oz. Top the Tator chive flavored sour cream instead of the recommended 24oz. and they turned out great! Accompanied with BBQ chicken and a spinach tossed salad it was an excellent meal for company and EASY! Love having something pre-made that can just be popped in the oven when entertaining and this worked perfectly! 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#This recipe is so good! When I made this for company, I was told that this was the best thing I ever made!!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#This recipe is a big hit with my family and me. It is easy to reheat and carry in lunches unlike twice baked potatoes.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I used about half the amount of sour cream and it was fine. Everyone love it!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Added chives and sprinkled with garlic salt! Excellent!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#It wasn't that good. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#our family loved this. however, i did make a few changes. i used about 1/4 of the sour cream (light), half bacon, half turkey bacon, reduced fat cheese, and a little bit of cream of mushroom soup about 1/4 cup. it was creamy and very tasty. will make again, and probably add some crushed red pepper flakes and maybe a dash of hot sauce, we love hot in our home! 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Just looking at the recipe, the 3 cups of sour cream seemed overdone. So, I reduced the sour cream to 16 oz, used only 1/2 pound bacon, omitted the extra salt, and reduced the amount of cheese, though I didn't really measure that. I had less than 1 c. of mozzerella, so I sprinkled on some grated parmesan. My 1.75 lbs of potatoes seemed a little scant, even in my smaller oval casserole, so I'm really glad I had decided to reduce the other ingredients.But, overall, it was very tasty and I will definitely be adding it to my potato dish rotation (with my changes, of course). 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I made this once and everyone thought there was too much sour cream. Next time I will use less sour cream and add some Italian spices and garlic to the potatoes. This will add some flavor as it was a bit on the bland side.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I also would not make this recipe altho it sounds like it tastes great. 720 mg of sodium per serving? 3 cups of sour cream and 5 cups of cheese for a recipe that serves 6-8 people? Even using low fat items, I think this is not something that in good conscience I would serve to people at my table, and I do like good food, but in moderation.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I used chopped smoked ham instead of bacon, and mixed it all togther instead of layering. I lined the crockpot with a cooking bag and poured it all in, cooked on low for 2 hours. Delicious and you can do other things with the oven or just mix and forget about it. It doesn't hurt to have it set longer. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Really good! Tastes just like a fantastic baked potato with all the fixin's! Enjoy! 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Oops! I sent the wrong review. Please forgive me.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Holy Hot Wings is right! I thought I died and went straight to [expletive]! It was so hot even my husband who loves anything burning his throat thought it was too hot.I am going to make it again but this time use much less hot sauce. I did use Frank's as some others recommended so maybe that was the problem. I love the ingredients for a dip so I'm hopeful the next try will be better. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Made this for the first time tonight and it was a hit. Will definitely make it a regular. I added my green onions with the bacon in the layers instead of just topping it with them. This could also be kicked up a notch with some jalapenos!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#DIdn't make this recipe -- the high fat content of the ingredients scared me away --Bacon, 2 types of cheese and sour cream. I'm sure it's yummy, but not so good for you. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#there are no - stars!! this was a TOTAL waste of good ingredients..the most tasteless dish I have ever made!!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Why do you health fanatics have to talk about how unhealthy some recipes are?? MOST good cooks, with a mind to health, would automatically use low fat or non fat items, and adjust ingrediants based on their families wants/needs and likes/dislikes. Reviews are meant to help others with ideas for making recipes BETTER, not bashing them!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Incredibly good.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#yes love it and it taste great with ranch dressing drizzled on top when it's done 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#awesome and delicious, best part is sour cream can be left out and it can be topped with ranch once it's done 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#This sounds so good, but I'll cut way back on the bacon, use fat free sour cream and reduced fat cheese and I'll bet the taste will be pretty much the same as with all the bacon and full fat cheeses. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#It sounds yummy but after checking the ingredients I checked the Nutritional Info and wondered why anyone would make something with sooo many calories & high fat content in 1 serving. No wonder there are so many obese people!! Let's eat right, exercise & get healthy. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I was looking for something different than the usual cheesy potato casserole. Followed the recipe as written and was not disappointed! Tastes great! When I make it again, I will use the entire 3 lb bag of red potatoes. Final product was a bit more saucy than I'd have liked. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#We have made this recipe several times. The entire family loves it.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#This is wondeerful on a cold day!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#This is a family favorite! We've been making this recipe since it first came out. The regular recipe didn't specify red potatoes, so we have always used russets. It's a staple at our holiday dinners. We love it! 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Very good. Has anyone ever tried freezing this recipe?
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Absolutely delicious. Instead of layering, I just laid all the potatoes in the dish and spread the sour cream over the potatoes, sprinkled onion and bacon, salted and peppered, then sprinkled cheeses on the top. Came out great! Definitely a new family favorite.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I saw this recipe years ago in the Quick Cooking Magazine. I have been making it ever since as it is a family favorite....it's often requested by the kids for their birthday dinner! 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#This is an awesome recipe. I have made this twice - once with no bacon because my wife hates it and the second time with several modifications to sort of make it my own. It was great both times but I really hit a homerun by adding both 1/2 pound bacon and 1/2 pound flavored chicken sausage. I also used a blend of feta, sharp cheddar, and sheep cheese which made it even creamier and extremely addictive! I also spruced it up with a few additional spices (lots of garlic!). Like another reviewer stated they did, I mixed all of the ingredients together as opposed to layering and then topped the casserole off with bread crumbs! This recipe is a must try and if you like to play around with the flavors like I do it is a fantastic starting point for making an absolutely amazing casserole.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#This was really good. My family all enjoyed it. Good leftovers also.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Fabulous, I receive tons of raves with this! I mixed it all together instead of layering it, and then put it in my crockpot and cooked on low (my crockpot runs pretty hot) for four hours. I buttered my crockpot really well first, and that seemed to help keep it from sticking too bad. I took it to the party, and left the crockpot on warm for several hours, and it worked out just fine! Everyone said that I'd have to make that everytime we get together. And no one even guessed or realized that it was gluten free, a true feat for us Celiacs! :) (Note, it's also a meal unto itself, so as a celiac at a social function, you know you can have a full meal in just the one safe dish!) 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I made this for Easter and everyone really liked it. I also made a separate one with only potatoes, cheese, and bacon. Both were delicious! I used regular baking potatoes instead of red. I will definitely make this again.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I also mix it up before putting it into a casserole dish. Has anyone ever heated it up in a crock pot? Just trying to make room in my oven!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#This is my absolute favorite potato casserole recipe of all time! I've made it on many occasions with fabulous results. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I liked this, but for me personally I tasted it before I cooked it and liked it better before it was baked. Everything is cooked so there is no danger of raw food. It reminded me of a loaded baked potato salad that you can buy (for a ridiculous price) at the deli. I would make it again, but probably serve it cold as an alternative to the everyday yellow mustard potato salad
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I made this for Christmas dinner and the entire family loved it. I would absolutely make this again.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Very tasty, but the original published recipe didn't call for red potatoes, just med. unpeeled potatoes. I used regular baked potatoes and it worked just fine. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#This was a great recipe. I think mixing it all together is easier than putting it in by layering.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Absolutely delicious! Have made this numerous times and the compliments just keep coming in! So many savory flavors in one dish. Comfort food at its very best.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#This one is a keeper. Everyone requested the recipe. I added more potatoes, sprinkled some scallions throughout and cooked it a little longer just to make sure the cheeses melted throughout. It not only tasted great but looked like the picture too! They can be made up ahead of time and can also be reheated the next day if you have any leftovers.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#FABULOUS!! I halved the recipe and added chopped smoked sausage for my husband and myself. Definitely one I will make again and again!!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#Everybody loved this!
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!! I made these for Christmas one year and people still rave over them.
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#I made this for a crowd for my granddaughter's christening luncheon. It is so much easier to put everything in a large bowl and mix it together and then put into baking dish. Each and every morsel is coated and incredibly delicious. 
Twice-Baked Potato Casserole#0#0#could use hamburger instead of bacon & make a one dish meal
Simple Taco Soup#1#0#Delicious! I used every ingredient and I wouldn't change a thing! Loved it!
Simple Taco Soup#2#0#I love this soup. We like things a little on the spicier side so the only thing I do is use 1/2 hamburger and 1/2 chorizo and add black beans also. I love black beans.
Simple Taco Soup#10#5#My family loves this recipe. I make it regularly (every couple of weeks) and I get no complaints. In fact, I usually double the recipe because my roommate wants plenty of leftovers. I accidentally added the taco seasoning in towards the end one time and it didn't seem to make much of a difference. It was just slightly less flavorful but it was still good. I usually add seasonings to the ground beef, as I fry it, and I put different beans in it but that's it. It comes out delicious every time. 
Simple Taco Soup#5#2#I used ranch style beans in place of the other beans. So good !!
Simple Taco Soup#6#9#Quick and simple and quite delicious. We used a can of the diced jalapenos to increase the heat factor instead of the diced green chilies. My husband put a layer of tortilla chips in his bowl first, then ladled the soup on top. My daughter and I ate it more like chips and dip - it's just delicious any way you want to enjoy it! Will be in our rotation. 
Simple Taco Soup#18#3#Yummy! Just needed some Tony's Chachere 
Simple Taco Soup#5#2#Super easy to prepare and very tasty!
Simple Taco Soup#25#5#So good! The only thing I added that was not on here was onions, but I love this recipe.
Simple Taco Soup#5#2#This is wonderful!!! I will definitely make it again! Five stars all the way!!!
Simple Taco Soup#25#6#I made this quickly after working a 10 hr day, I added sautéed chopped onion, cumin, Sazon, extra water, salt, onion powder and pepper as it was a little bland for my family's tastebuds. We topped with sour cream & shredded cheese Fast & easy ??
Simple Taco Soup#22#9#This was really good! I tweaked it a little to make it my own. First, I cooked this in my crockpot on low for 7-8 hours .browning the meat first with the taco seasoning which I doubled for more flavor. I also used beef broth instead of water. I added another can of diced tomatoes in addition to the stewed and also added in a 4oz can of sliced black olives. At the end of cooking, I added in 4oz of cream cheese to make the soup a creamier version. Served it with some cheese sprinkled on top, tortilla chips and sour cream. My whole family loved it! Will definitely make it again.
Simple Taco Soup#41#0#Instead of a cans of chopped chilies and cans of stewed tomatoes. Just use 2 cans of Rotel they already have chilies and other seasonings.
Simple Taco Soup#10#3#I really use this recipe a lot, thanks
Simple Taco Soup#16#1#This is a quick, yummy soup. I made it as per written. Served with tortilla strips & sour cream, shredded cheese and guacamole for garnish.
Simple Taco Soup#5#10#Mediocre to us. It just did not taste as good as other versions of this soup.
Simple Taco Soup#2#1#I've been having the same problem Judy Elizabeth- only for a couple of months and no help from taste of home, so guess I'll just opt out of this site 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Taste of Home: I haven't been able to save any recipes to my Recipe Box for over a week. I hope this gets some attention, because I haven't been able to reach anyone for help. 
Simple Taco Soup#2#0#Love to take this recipe when going to visit the kids. I do the cooking while visiting and this is a great first night meal. Quick and easy and so good. I made the recipe as written.
Simple Taco Soup#6#9#Loved this recipe! And so did my husband and kids! As a family of 4, with very different tastes in food, it can get complicated trying to satisfy everyone with the same meal... But this taco soup is definitely going in my recipe book! Simple, fast and delicious! Only alternatives I made was ground turkey instead of beef, turkey chili with beans, (due to my teenage son's crohns & my acid reflux) and ranch style pinto beans instead of regular.. ty Taste of Home! 
Simple Taco Soup#12#0#I made this exactly as directed and it is delicious as is! Thank you for a wonderful recipe! We are serving this with cornbread! Yum! ??
Simple Taco Soup#6#1#This taco soup was delicious. I added hot chilies to it to make more spicy. I also made vegetarian by using plant based crumbles instead of meat.
Simple Taco Soup#24#40#This is a good base for a taco soup recipe (a good starting point). I found this recipe alone to be far too bland. I added to the recipe cilantro, onion, another taco seasoning packet, sundried tomatoes, chipotle, chili powder, comino, crushed red pepper flakes, salt & pepper. We topped with green onions, cheese & avocado. I definitely would have added more rotel (diced tomatoes with green chilis) if I had the extra can. Also, I nixed the ranch- just because that is crazy to me....ranch does not pair well with tacos & is a rule breaker in our home.
Simple Taco Soup#5#126#I love it it is the BEST SOUP EVER that is why i gave it one star
Simple Taco Soup#9#1#I did it it was great
Simple Taco Soup#7#9#I only gave it four stars because I tweaked it a little. I added chick peas and a dash of salt to mine as well as used ground Turkey instead of beef to make it a little healthier and added an onion as well. We topped ours with cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips
Simple Taco Soup#2#0#This is a great recipe. I make the soup for my family. We all love it.
Simple Taco Soup#6#5#Great basic recipe, can use as is, or adjust. Our family does like a little extra flavour in our food, so we usually add more spices than a recipe calls for. And I did add a few extras to make more soup to last longer with portions to freeze for later. Apart from the basic recipe: I added 1 can black beans, 1 diced green pepper, 1 diced white onion, 1/2 can leftover tomato soup (just to avoid wasting it.) Some cumin, paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, parsley, adobo seasoning, chipotle chile powder, and about 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese, and some more water. I added black olives to mine but not the entire pot, because a lot of people hate olives. I love them though and they are a great addition! Then we topped as desired with sour cream, cheddar cheese, and crushed tortilla chips when serving. It worked out great. This recipe is versatile in how you can add to it or adjust it to make it work for you / stretch it for extra servings. I would have never thought about using the ranch dressing packet but that was a good idea.
Simple Taco Soup#6#1#Homerun! I threw all of this (plus a jalapeno) into my slow cooker 4-5 hours. Perfect soup with jalapeno cheese cornbread with very little clean up!
Simple Taco Soup#1#0#This soup is one of my favorites! I added the black olives as was suggested by a reviewer and that was a WIN. This will stay in the rotation of favorite meals. We also topped it with cheese and sliced avocado.
Simple Taco Soup#2#0#I have made this soup lots of times!! Everyone loves it---I make exactly as is except I add a large can of sliced black olives---try it, really makes a difference! Everyone always comments on the black olives and say they really love this addition!
Simple Taco Soup#1#0#Decided to make this tonight for our family and two friends. Went to grocery store to buy the ingredients, made this recipe and it was ready to serve, all within 25 minutes. Every person at the table LOVED this soup! I doubled the recipe except for the kidney and black beans .....I still only used one can of each of those. DELICIOUS! SO QUICK AND EASY!! This one's a keeper!
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#This is one of the best soups I've ever eaten. 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#This is awesome and so easy, eating now with garlic bread. Will be a staple from now on.
Simple Taco Soup#1#1#Made this soup very good. We had a soup day 1year ago made this it was a hit at my church. Very easy to make Debbie
Simple Taco Soup#2#0#Tasted amazing! I will be making this more often. I added shreded cheese and chilli fritos as a topping.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Very good and very simple
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Delicious and super quick and easy!
Simple Taco Soup#3#0#I made this soup and loved it, so did the neighbors.....however, i used the CROCK POT had it on high for about 4-5 hours and it was great. I always think longer cooking brings out more flavor.
Simple Taco Soup#3#2#I made this recipe when we went to visit our kids and grandkids. I browned the meat and took along with the other ingredients. I made this for our supper the night we arrived. So easy. Everything was open and add and the taste was incredible. Would totally prefer this over chili anyday. Add cornchips and sour cream and cheese. So good.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#This was the most simplest taco soup recipe I've ever used! I did not use both cans of beans because I'm not a fan, but other than that, THE RECIPE WAS GREAT!!
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#This is so quick and easy to make. Especially for all of you working mom's with school age children! My family Loved it! 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Love this recipe! Not a fan of pinto beans so I leave those out and I use the petite diced tomatoes. The kicker- when we eat it. Add corn chips , shredded cheese and sour cream!! OMG! Making this right now. It IS #NationalTacoDay 
Simple Taco Soup#3#0#This soup is wonderful. The sodium is high, however, I was able to find all canned items in low or no sodium which did not change the taste at all. I did add a chopped onion and a can of diced tomatoes. Thanks Taste of Home.
Simple Taco Soup#0#1#My family loves soup, especially now with the cold weather. Can't wait to try this one. I am also one who is never very good at following a recipe and soups is perfect for adding your own touches. 
Simple Taco Soup#2#1#Great soup! I omitted the corn and the chilis since that's heartburn overload. For all the whiners out there about the sodium intake, everything listed is generally sold with a low sodium version at the store now. Believe me, it's not hard to find. I also scratched the stewed tomatoes for diced. Will make this again!
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#What do I do if I want the soup to be more in the pot?:)
Simple Taco Soup#3#2#Pretty good if you're looking for a quick easy recipe. Some people will complain about anything and everything. As a professional athlete I understand that it's important to have a healthy overall diet but not every meal has to be perfectly healthy. Your kids will be ok ??
Simple Taco Soup#3#1#I would think are many kids out there who would love a nice, hot bowl of soup for dinner. Much better than a bowl of cold cereal or the alternative of NOTHING. I think we need to stop being such food snobs. There is nothing wrong with feeding your family a hearty bowl of soup for dinner. Call me lazy but I can't wait to try this recipe. Thanks Taste of Home! 
Simple Taco Soup#3#0#Overall this soup turned out great! My only issue was that the 1 1/2 cups of water was not nearly enough liquid! I ended up adding about double that amount. I substituted beef broth for the water and it was a great addition. I also only used black beans, two cans, and I used a whole bag of frozen corn instead of canned. It was a huge hit with my whole family!
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#I've made this before and it's really good. I updated it after awhile though because my husband likes thick soups so I add a can of refried beans in the mix. 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#This (sometimes substituting ground turkey for beef) is a favorite'go to' recipe in our kitchen! Cornbread, made from our new favorite mix,'Miracle Maize', found at Walmart, makes it a meal! 
Simple Taco Soup#0#1#Soup is fine but the ranch dressing mix was left out of the the recipe shown. Had to look at the video to confirm that it was in there lol
Simple Taco Soup#1#1#Sounds really good, but only one cup exceeds my daily sodium intake.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#need nacho chips for a topping
Simple Taco Soup#1#0#This soup looks really good but the sodium is over the top. I won't be making this. 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#The soup is supper easy. Our church does a fund raiser making soup and I have made this for the event and it was well received.
Simple Taco Soup#0#1#I love this, it's fast and easy.. but I do things a lil different, first off I use a slow cooker.. then i double the recipe so I can have left overs.. also I use the Rotel with lime and cilantro instead of the the tomatoes and chili's... also instead if water I use chicken stock or beef broth whichever I have handy. try it, I promise you will not regret it!
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#This soup is WONDERFUL. I don't like stewed tomatoes so I just used a can of diced. I didn't add the extra chiles either. Some may like a little more zing but I didn't want it to be too spicy. Serve with a little cheese and corn chips. 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#This is easy to make and delicious. I pretty much follow the recipe, but am careful with the green chiles. If you use Rotel tomatoes with chilis, you have enough spice as far as I am concerned. Usually the soup becomes spicier as it sits.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Taco soup is my all time favorite soup
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#I did not make this recipe as stated, as I have been making my taco soup different. After sauteeing the Hamburg, I add one large chopped onion with 2-3 cloves garlic, minced. One to 2 cans diced tomatoes with or without green chilies, stewed tomato are great also. Add to this one to 2 pkgs. Taco seasoning. Now add one to 2 cans of black beans, and same amount of canned corn, or frozen corn. Add salt and pepper to taste and enough water to make the soup just right. Simmer for approx. half hour. I used to make this for my sister's restaurant in Wyoming 20 years ago. Everybody loves it! Please be sure to drain corn and beans. No need to rinse. Some times I add some chili powder also. 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Wonderful flavor, cook it all the time even in Summer!
Simple Taco Soup#1#0#This is a great recipe!
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#This is great!!! ??
Simple Taco Soup#0#6#I was not a fan of this recipe. I should have noticed when it called for almost all canned ingredients that it would not be too tasty. Basically you just throw all the ingredients together and hope for the best. I had to add an extra pack of taco seasoning so that this soup could have a better taste then just canned beans and tomatoes. I also added sugar because the ranch dressing adds a sour taste to the soup that I had to cover up and some chili garlic sauce to give it a kick. I would suggest to omit the ranch dressing all together. Matter of fact, throw the whole recipe away and try again.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#First time to make this soup and it was a big hit. I will be making again.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Absolutely love this recipe!! Got it 17 years ago from a neighbor who made it for a baby shower!!
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Great recipe. I've been making this for years. Love the ranch dressing in it. I top each bowl with cheddar cheese , avocado slices and tortilla chips. 
Simple Taco Soup#1#0#This is basically the Weight Watchers Taco Soup recipe. I use ground turkey (healthier) and more beans, and throw in a dried chipotle pepper to make it more like chili than soup. I also do not add the can of stewed tomatoes, just two cans of the tomatoes with green chilies.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Love this recipe! However, I usually only cook for my husband and I, and neither one of us are a huge fan of the chunks of tomatoes. To accommodate this, I use a can of tomato juice and tomato sauce. Also, we add chicken broth for extra flavor. Really gives it a warm and comforting taste!
Simple Taco Soup#0#1#I didn't have the original ranch so substituted fiesta ranch and it was delicious . 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#This is a great soup. It is very flavorful and easy to prepare. Love the convenience.
Simple Taco Soup#0#1#This is an easy and quick recipe that is great for the fall cool weather. I only made substitutions for things I did not have on hand such as making my own ranch dressing mix, replacing stewed tomatoes with diced tomatoes with onion powder, and using chili hot beans instead of the drained pinto beans and can of green chilies. If I had all of the ingredients on hand, I wouldn't have changed anything. 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#This soup is excellent! A handful of grated cheddar on top and it really was perfection.
Simple Taco Soup#0#1#EVERYONE LOVES IT!
Simple Taco Soup#1#0#We love this on cooler nights! We have even made it beforehand and taken it camping. Huge hit around the campfire. We don't add the rotel, or pinto beans, Instead we do petite diced tomatoes and tomato sauce, we also do lite red and dark red kidney beans, black beans and refried beans. Serve it with crushed up tortilla chips on the bottom of the bowl, a sprinkle of shredded mexican blend cheese and a flour soft taco shell on the side. Great meal! 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Looks great. Suggestion - how about showing the directions using the Instant Pot?
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#I had a friend make this at a get together and it was delicious. She didn't drain any of the ingredients and neither do I. I add my normal spices, garlic, onion, Tony's creole, salt and pepper. Plus the ranch and taco season. Perfect fall and winter meal. It was cooler in my area so I had to make it. 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Thought it was not bad, but not amazing either. Followed the recipe to a T
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Have not tried it yet, but will tonight. Recheck your nutritional information, it looks off compared to what I found.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Love it! Added a can of diced tomato and 2 packets of taco seasoning mix!
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#I love this recipe. I double the batch and add an onion (house full of boys). That way we have leftovers for lunch! Add some tortilla chips and you are good to go!
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#I love this recipe!! I have tweaked the recipe a little I dont add the ranch dressing mix, and I do it without beans taste good on corn chips or tortilla chips, I had some on elbow macaroni and it was good!! My husband loves it too!!
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#The taco seasoning & ranch make this recipe. I use veggie broth instead of water, I add green beans, I use diced flat iron steak not ground beef. I also use black beans instead of chili beans. I drain everything except tomatoes. Adding ur favorite salsa is awesome too.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#We loved this soup tonight. It has been a dreary, overcast day and this soup was perfect comfort food. I followed the recipe exactly and we have some left over for lunch tomorrow. I highly recommend this recipe.Volunteer Field Editor
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#I make this often and, as with many recipes, I make changes such as adding an onion and not draining the corn before adding it. Sometimes I pour it over rice or pasta and top it with shredded cheese. It's even better the next day and kids like to use tortilla chips as edible spoons. 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Absolutely loved; quick, very easy will make again!!!
Simple Taco Soup#1#1#I have made this soup many times over the years. My husband likes mixing pasta with it and calls it Mexican goulash. The kids like topping it with shredded cheese and sour cream. To fab411, the additional of the packet of ranch salad dressing is included with Stir in the remaining ingredients. To Woolyhobbies, it's obvious you haven't made the soup and are only injecting your personal opinion about salt consumption. Why don't you create your own low sodium version and post it to be reviewed? I appreciate the reviews and comments from those who actually made the dish and gave an honest opinion. There are some great suggestions given for variations that make this a very versatile recipe. 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Honey Moley...that's a boat load of salt in only 1 cup of soup. What hungry adult is going to eat only 1 cup? A doctor at the Mayo Clinic is quoted as telling us (who are NOT on a low salt diet) to consume 2000 mg of salt for the WHOLE day so with a cup and a half you will be eating more than is healthy. It may be delicious but I'll have to pass. 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#I made this soup 2 days ago with only a couple changes: 1 lb each gr. beef & Italian sausage, with some onion and garlic powder cook with the meat. I only added less than 1 cup additional water than called for in the recipe and the soup is delicious! We don't like a watery soup but prefer substance and this worked out well. Unlike some posts we liked the pinto beans in the soup! 
Simple Taco Soup#1#0#This is a really good soup for the whole family to enjoy. After reading the reviews I did make a few minor adjustments - I used black beans instead of pinto beans, large (28 oz) canned diced tomatoes in place of stewed and diced w/ green chiles cans, and more water (2 1/2 to 3 cups) because I wanted a true soup. I did add the can of green chiles and there was plenty of flavor. I will definitely make this again.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Easy to make and very flavorable. Did not add the pinto beans. Will make again..
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#One of my favorite cold-weather soups. The only change I made was using ground turkey instead of the beef. Other than that, it's perfect. 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#This soup is really yummy. I have had several requests for the recipe after having tasted the soup when I've made it. This definitely does not happen with most of the recipes I've tried. This one is a keeper. I will be making it again and again. 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Very good and simple. I did add a chopped onion with the beef and added an extra cup of water. I like it with more juice.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Really good recipe. My whole family liked it. I added a little more water to make it more soupy and left out the can of pinto beans. Will make it again.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#really good quick recipe . I used diced tomatoes instead of the stewed, and substituted salsa for the ranch seasoning. I served it with crispy tortilla strips and shredded cheese.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Excellent recipe not only easy to make its quick and DELICIOUS!!
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#This is a great recipe. I tweaked it by changing to 1 lb sweet Italian sausage and 1 lb ground beef. I also added 2 add'l cans of the stewed tomatoes and 2 more cans of kidney beans along with 1/2 can tomato paste, 1/2 cup sugar, couple teasp. crushed red pepper, pinch of salt and pepper and finally some chopped garlic in oil and passed it off as chili at our work chili cook-off. I won the contest so thank you for sharing!!! 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Really Yummy. I cut the recipe in half and ended up using the full amount of liquid and it still was not very soupy so that is the only thing I would change about it in the future.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#For those who need low sodium, I make my own mixes and just leave out the salt. They work very well in most recipes.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Simple, easy and very good tasting. The only change I made was to use diced tomatos instead of stewed tomatoes,
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Taco Chilli is one of my favorites except I make mine with Black beans, ground turkey and no stewing tomotoes....AWESOME!!!
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Has anyone ever made this in a crockpot? Just putting it all together and slow cooking for a few hours? Wanting to do that today on this rainy day!
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#It was a good recipe, but wasn't a WOW recipe. (We also added sour cream, shredded cheddar, crushed chips.) It was an easy recipe to throw together on a weeknight, but not one I would choose over my normal chili dish or even our chicken enchilada soup staple. 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#My whole family and my Girl Scout Troop all love this soup. You can control how spicy it is and the girls especially love adding cheese, chips, tomatoes, some even like to put lettuce on top. It's a staple in my house and on Girl Scout overnights! 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Haven't made this yet, but as I'm raising 3 grandchildren and ALWAYS on the hunt for good, simple AND easy...I will be happy to try it!Adding garlic and onions seems logical to me..come to think about..adding garlic and onions to ANYTHING containing ground meat sounds like it should be etched in granite!P. 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#I added chopped onion and garlic when browning the ground beef. Drained it. I added 1 can of northern white chili beans instead of Pinto beans. I didn't add the can of chiles. The diced tomatoes and chiles where plenty hot enough. I added 1 cup of rice and 4 cups water. Put a dash of red pepper and sugar and salsa. Then added colby/monteray jack cheese to cut the spice down. 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#My husband loved it! I'll serve it at our next Small Group from Church in 2weeks! 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#This was easy and tasty! I had hamburger and chorizo already cooked from a previous meal so it came together fast! I did add some chopped onion and beef base for a richer flavor. I will make this again!
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#This is a delicious recipe!! I especially love it because it's quick! 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#I love this soup but I use 2 packets of the spicy taco seasoning, a cup of rice and add 4 cups of water instead of 1 1/2 due to the rice soaking up the water. Also sprinkle taco cheese on top and sliced black olives when served.
Simple Taco Soup#0#1#This is my Dads favorite soup and we all like even the picky eaters in the family . I found this recipe recently and he has requested it 3 times so far. I did make some adjustments I melted some cheese and half and half in to it but it tastes just fine with out it.
Simple Taco Soup#1#0#Very simple and delicious! My mom is on a low sodium diet so we used Old el Paso 30% less sodium taco seasoning. I also used reduced sodium pinto beans and no salt canned corn and stewed tomatoes. Didn't compromise on taste at all! Served it with sour cream, sliced black olives and reduced fat shreaded cheddar cheese as toppings. Family loved it, my picky eaters. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It's a winner! 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#it taste so good
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#I had to moderate the recipe a little. I added some elbow macaroni and left out the diced tomatoes with chiles. My husband and I both have acid reflux. I still enjoyed the Taco mix without all the extra hot ingredients. It is yummy.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#Very easy and tasty! Freezes well, too.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#great soup, all family members love it from young to the very old
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#LOVE this recipe! I make it at least once every couple of weeks during the cold fall and winter months. It's quick to prepare and the leftovers are just as good, if not better. My family also likes to add shredded cheese and tortilla chips on top. Yummy!! 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#This recipe was given to me by a friend. I first made it for a soup and salad day at work. It was such a hit I make it frequently at home as well.
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#So easy, very healthy & extremely tasty!! Definitely a winner with my family!!
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#This is truly a simple, delicious soup! My pickiest eater says it's her favorite food ever! 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#I first made this a few years ago when it first came out in the magazine- carried it to work and they ask for it so much that it's unbelievable. 
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#We LOVE this soup! It is so very easy and so delicious on a cold night. All of the ingredients can be kept on hand for quick meal. I have a friend who has made this with chicken with delicious results. I have passed this recipe along to many!
Simple Taco Soup#0#0#normally, I can't eat anything spicy and even though this does have a kick to it if you add the 4 oz of green chilies, it's not too bad. however, you can just leave that out if you choose. 
Porcupine Meatballs#1#6#Do NOT add the water in the first step. It renders the meatballs to a fluid and they fall apart during browning.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Absolutely a keeper! My two kids are the world's pickiest eaters ever and they absolutely love these. I made them exactly to recipe. Thanks for sharing this we love it 
Porcupine Meatballs#2#1#Was easy to make and yummy. Next time I would had seasoning to the hamburger for more flavor.
Porcupine Meatballs#21#6#Wow these are pretty fancy compared to the ones I grew up with. Ours were hamburger, rice, salt, and pepper then simmered in a partially diluted can of tomato soup. The gravy was served over the meatballs and mashed potatoes. One of my favorite childhood meals and one that was passed down several generations.
Porcupine Meatballs#12#1#A great old timer recipe. My mom made the and I use to make them for my kids. The other night I was talking with my son and as what he was doing, he said he was making Porcupine meatballs. The tradition is carried on.
Porcupine Meatballs#12#2#I always called these stuffed peppers without the peppers. I made them with tomato soup.
Porcupine Meatballs#16#8#I used to make these with Rice-a-Roni all the time, and now I can just use plain rice in my pantry. I used ground chicken instead of ground beef, because we don't eat beef. The tomato sauce was so delicious. I served homemade mac and cheese with it, and it made one of the best meals I have had in a while. My husband loved it. 
Porcupine Meatballs#6#1#We always used the beef, or onion, flavored Rice-a-Roni. Mix the sauce packet and water and cook the meatballs, covered, according to the box directions. Will have to try the tomato-based version soon. Thanks for the memory!
Porcupine Meatballs#33#8#As per other comments, my mom made these for our family when I was growing up. She did not serve them with rice, but she wouldn't cook them in a deeper Dutch oven, and towards the end of cooking would cut up a green cabbage and cut the quarters into halves and place those pieces all around the meatballs and down into the tomato sauce. I remember just hearing contented sighs, slurps, and Mmm's at the dinner table. No talking. I need to make this for my family since I haven't done it in a long time. Thank you for the memory! 
Porcupine Meatballs#12#3#I made this for my kids when they were growing up and it was this exact recipe. They always loved it. However, I do use minute rice' in the recipe. Delicious.
Porcupine Meatballs#18#13#As a rule we love porcupine meatballs, just not this recipe. The 1/2 cup of water with the beef makes them ridiculously soggy, and they don't hold their shape while browning and end up as mush.
Porcupine Meatballs#20#1#My mom made these when I was growing up and she used a can of vegetable juice and put flour on outside the balls and brought vegetable juice to a boil and added the balls in and the flour thickened the sauce. I do it the same way.
Porcupine Meatballs#76#9#I remember a time long long ago lol..when my mom was making this for our family. I was a teenager and my little brother was about 5. I remember thinking it looked so good. Mom was taking toothpicks and stabbing them ..giving us all one to sample. Just as I was about to sample what I though looked and smelled fabulous my little brother screamed at my mom, stomped his foot and yelled No way! No way I am not eating stinky. I about died. I laughed so hard I cried. From that day forward me nor my brother would eat mamas porcupine meatballs. Tomorrow is my brothers 47th birthday. I am skipping the cake and bringing stinky. I can't wait to see his face. Happy Birthday Mikey. This also dispelled that old rumor that Mikey will eat anything . he won't. 
Porcupine Meatballs#4#5#I think I would caramelize the onions when making the recipe, but that does look delicious. I always served mine with extra rice.
Porcupine Meatballs#8#0#A great oldy but goody recipe! Left out the water because I used leftover rice that was already cooked.
Porcupine Meatballs#7#1#This was great!! Very tasty. My husband nosed in and said the rice wasn't going to cook but it did and he loved it. I left out celery salt just because I didn't have any. 
Porcupine Meatballs#22#7#These turned out perfectly! The only adjustment I made was to the sauce- I omitted the sugar, threw in a few of the chopped onions and increased the Worcestershire sauce to a tablespoon. The rice will cook through if you match it with the same amount of water in the meatballs, as called for in the recipe. Delicious - will be making again!
Porcupine Meatballs#6#2#I have this recipe and it called for instant rice, not long grain rice. It cooked perfectly each time
Porcupine Meatballs#4#3#I made this and followed the instructions as directed but the rice did not cook all the way. I had to throw it all away. Perhaps switching to instant rice would solve e this problem.
Porcupine Meatballs#13#3#My family simply uses a large can of Campbell's Tomato Soup versus the sauce, sugar, worchestershire and it's very yummy. 
Porcupine Meatballs#4#2#This was one of my favorites as a child, only my mom used tomato soup with 3/4 dilution. We also cook the meatballs right in the soup in an electric skillet. If you allow the soup to thicken slightly and then add the meatballs, they cook in the sauce with the added grease of the meat mixing in from the browning process. 
Porcupine Meatballs#6#4#These are very good and excellent to make ahead and freeze. One reviewer said not to add the water to the meatballs but to put it in the sauce. This is incorrect. There are two different water measurements and the first one goes in the meatballs which is needed moisture for the rice.
Porcupine Meatballs#17#16#Mom made these my entire unmarried life and I've made them for 50 years using her recipe. You have made it way to difficult. It's just hamburger, onion, egg, rice mixed into balls. Put into a casserole dish. Mix 2 cans tomato soup with water and pour over the meatballs. I add a little red pepper flakes for spice and salt and pepper. Serve with more cooked rice or mashed potatoes with the sauce.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#1#Been making these for years in the pressure cooker. Ended up changing the sauce to spagetti sauce though.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#1#WOW,takes me back to 1982! Mom made this a bunch. Make that grub go as far as you could!
Porcupine Meatballs#4#1#I've made this for years. Learned from my Mom. We make extra sauce snd use it over mashed potatoes or we wedge some cabbage, lay it on top of the meatballs snd pour the sauce over it all. Family favorite for sure.
Porcupine Meatballs#1#6#I have made porcupine meatballs many times in my life but decided to look for something different. I followed this recipe exactly and my husband and I found it almost inedible. This was very disappointing.
Porcupine Meatballs#8#21#I make this, but not with a tomato base. First, I use instant rice mixed with the hamburger meat, minced garlic, minced mushrooms, & diced up onion. I baked the meatballs(350° 15-20 mins or until done.) In a large pot, I cooked a 3-4 servings amount of the instant rice per box instructions, I then add 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup with needed amount of milk. Once soup is smoothly mixed in with rice, I add the meatballs. Heat on low to medium heat until heated through.
Porcupine Meatballs#1#1#Absolutely delicious!
Porcupine Meatballs#1#0#Family favorite for many many years. Easy and delicious sure to please a group of fussy people.
Porcupine Meatballs#8#4#This was a good recipe. Different from one my mom made but better. I omitted the brown sugar because I thought it would be too sweet. I noticed some comments indicating that the water made meatballs too mushy. The water isn't supposed to be added to the meat mixture, but with the sauce- after the meatballs have been browned. 
Porcupine Meatballs#5#1#I am making this for the 2nd time. It is so delicious. I didn't change a thing. my 17 yr. grandson even liked them and he only eats ground beef between a bun. All the amounts were listed, just enough spice. Thank you!!! 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#1#Why is the amount of worcestershire sauce and brown sugar needed not in the recipe???
Porcupine Meatballs#6#2#This recipe is elevated from a 4 star to a 5 star with the following tweaks.... First, I only use 1/4 c water in the meat mixture, and add an egg to help bind the ingredients when mixing - otherwise they tend to fall apart. I use a quick rice. Also, I microwave the onion in a tsp of water for 1.5 minutes before mixing in with rest of ingredients. Most importantly, I make 1.5 times the sauce by increasing all of the ingredients by 1.5 except the water, which I leave at 1c. (I use Italian seasoned tomato sauce.) This way we have plenty of sauce, as we like to enjoy this dish over mashed potatoes. PS: Remember to cover the dish while cooking or your rice may not get done! (I made this mistake the first time I made them many years ago.)
Porcupine Meatballs#3#0#Awesome recipe! Super good!.....for those who have crunchy rice....uniform meatball size (try using a cookie scoop) and/or forgetting the water are your likely culprits. This will work very well every time as written.
Porcupine Meatballs#3#2#Tripled the recipe for a family dinner and it tasted so good. I used what we had at home so the sauce was a jar or spaghetti sauce and tomato paste with equal parts water. Then we also added two eggs. They were awesome. Would make again.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I always make mine in a crockpot. I thought, last minute, I wanted this and gave it a try. Sorry, was not happy. It looked odd, to not have an egg to hold together, but I gave it a shot.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Great recipe...will be making these more often for the grand babies.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I had some doubts while making this recipe exactly as directed as the meatballs were a bit mushy (might use less water next time) and a bit difficult to saute but after cooking them in the sauce, they were fantastic!! Anything you would like to add to the sauce will be absorbed by the rice and increase the flavor (garlic, hot sauce, a bit of parmesian). The other half and a guest (unexpected) raved about them and asked for seconds. This is definitely on my regular rotation for meals. Thank you so much for the recipe!!
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Didn't turn out well. IF I ever make these again I will omit the water in the meatballs cause they fell apart. I will also omit the sugar, a little too sweet 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#1#I followed this recipe except I used 1 can campbells soup, a small can of tomato sauce and omitted the sugar. Turned out delicious. I will make again.
Porcupine Meatballs#1#0#I make this in my pressure cooker. No frying. Delicious
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Good recipe but use instant rice instead and don't add water to mixture. I found using regular rice, the rice doesn't cook thoroughly. 
Porcupine Meatballs#1#1#We had these growing up too, but they were always part of my mom's stuffed pepper recipe, I suspect we children didn't like the pepper part. Also, I remember her tucking the meatballs in around the peppers to cook. It was a way also to use up the extra stuffing after the peppers were stuffed. 
Porcupine Meatballs#1#1#Our family loves these. We always use beef Rice-a-roni and a egg to help hold in all together. It turns out great and is delicious!
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I make Porcupine meatballs using cream of mushroom and cream of celery soups. Makes a wonderful gravy. I do cook my rice first tho.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Have been making a variation of this for 50 years called swedish porcupine meatballs using minute rice and substituting cream of celery or cream of mushroom soup for the tomato sauce with rice as a side dish.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#My mother made these using a can of tomato soup for the sauce. I've made it with green pepper plus onion and an egg 
Porcupine Meatballs#2#4#Been making these for 50 years from a recipe of my Mom's. It can be much simpler than this. Mix ground beef, salt, pepper and rice to bind. Mix and shape into Golf ball size balls. Put porcupine balls into deep casserole dish. Mix 1 or 2 cans of tomato soup and a can of tomato sauce with enough water in a separate bowl, to make sauce cover the balls. Pour sauce over the balls. Cover and bake at 335-350. Check after an hour or 90 minutes. Be sure to get the porcupine balls covered in the sauce since this is what cooks the rice. If they are not covered, the rice will be hard and crispy. If you like it a little spicy, add some tobasco sauce, Siracha or cayenne.
Porcupine Meatballs#1#0#I've made these for years. Family loves them. I place cabbage wedges on top of the meatballs and pour the sauce over all. I ended up with undone cabbage rolls. ????
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#One of my favorites as a kid! My mother used tomato soup instead of tomato sauce to make it extra appealing to us kids.
Porcupine Meatballs#1#0#This used to be my go to recipe when I 1st got married back in 1979! The recipe was in my Betty Crocker recipe cards! 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#My beloved Grama used to make these. She passed away in 1992. She put her meatballs in tomato soup with some milk. She only used chopped onion, rice, S
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I make them all the time only I have been taught to make them with tomato soup and just salt and pepper in my meatballs. Delicious
Porcupine Meatballs#1#0#So glad to see another recipe from my mother's kitchen! This is a great recipe and method. My mother used her pressure cooker. That cooks the rice thoroughly too!
Porcupine Meatballs#1#0#All my family love these porcupine meatballs. Actually, I've never seen them published anywhere; came from an old edition of Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook. Betty 
Porcupine Meatballs#1#0#I substituted the tomato sauce with a can of cracked black pepper and roasted garlic crushed tomatoes
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I have been making these since I was a bride 48 years ago. They are a family favorite. I use calrose rice as that is what we keep on hand for everything. It is very simple and easy. I generally don't use any additional ingredients and have never had a problem with the rice not cooking. It is very soft but will hold together if carefully browned. If that is too hard then baking the meatballs might be simple. We love the moist tender texture. 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#This was excellent! Didn't need eggs to bind, the water helped bind everything. Delicious! 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#A simple recipe and very good taste. No problems making for me.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#The meat mixture was very soft and hard to form into balls. Not all of the rice wanted to stick and it many grains ended up in the sauce, giving the sauce a thicker and chunkier texture. I also thought that the finished product was very soft. Next time I would add some bread crumbs or an egg to give these meatballs some structure.
Porcupine Meatballs#1#0#I used precooked rice and made my meatballs by the recipe, but immediately thought they would never hold together. Another reviewer suggested adding an egg and some bread crumbs, so I dumped the meat mixture back together, included the additions and it worked out like a charm. This is a really wonderful recipe - thanks so much for sharing. it!
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I use quick cooking rice instead of long grain. I've been making this for years and with that type of rice you won't have the crunchy rice issue. It's a favorite of mine and coworkers, including the gluten-free ones since it doesn't have bread crumbs like many meatball recipes. The sauce is good and you can always add more seasonings to your tastes. The sauce reminds me of a much tastier version of the spaghettio's sauce I loved as a kid. 
Porcupine Meatballs#4#1#My Mom always made these and we all loved them. For people complaining about the rice being to hard there is a trick my mom used and I do too. Put the rice in a bowl and cover with the 1/2 cup water and let it sit for at least 10 mins(I usually get everything else ready and by that time the 10 mins is almost up). That will soften the rice a little and make it cook better. We use that trick for making Stuffed Peppers also.
Porcupine Meatballs#1#0#For those that complain about hard rice... what beef are you using 80/20 ... 90/10?? The rice takes on moisture from the meat to expand.... so don't be too lean on the burger! This could be the issue! 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I made them they were so good I could hardly put my plate down! It was a big hit with my family
Porcupine Meatballs#1#0#I first made this recipe around 10-12 years ago. Everyone that eats these always wants the recipe. My boyfriend will do anything that needs done around the house when I serve him these with a nice fresh salad, garlic bread & some sweet tea lol. Best of all, I don't even have to ask him ;)Came here today to get the recipe, because I'm making them for him tonight. He is gonna be so pleased to walk in from work smelling the deliciousness as he enters the door. My mouth is watering just thinking about them simmering mmm mmm. Please do not hesitate on trying this recipe ladies and gents, you will not be disappointed, I promise ya!Thank you so much for the recipe Darlis! You're an angel. I'm in Wisconsin too. Lived down south the first time I made these. Again I cannot thank you enough for this incredible recipe. You rock Darlis :) 
Porcupine Meatballs#1#0#It was wonderful! My Husband, for the first time since we've been married went back for thirds. This is definitely a keeper. We have only been married for two months. I'm a vegetarian so I don't taste his dishes with meat in them. I could tell this was going to be delish because of the yummy aroma, and it was very easy, yet looked as if I had been cooking all day. Thanks ! 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I make this all the time but I use parboiled rice instead of the raw long grain rice that may help those of you that your rice is not getting done.
Porcupine Meatballs#3#1#This is a fantastic recipe. I'd been craving porcupine meatballs, a memory from childhood. I also babysit my great-grandson once a week and wanted something for lunch that might appeal to a 2 1/2 year old. I followed the instructions to the letter except for the celery salt. I had some, but I couldn't remember how old it was so I omitted that ingredient. The meatballs were perfect...the rice perfectly cooked and the sauce was thick and savory. I only meant to sample them as they are to be our lunch tomorrow. I put three on a saucer and ended up going back for three more. (I'm actually tempted to go back a 3rd time.) I've copied the recipe and added it to my notebook of favorites. Someone suggested that the ones who complained of undercooked rice might have made the meatballs too big. I simmered mine exactly an hour and the rice was just right. 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#This recipe is so good. I have finally found one from my childhood. My go to meatball recipe now. Thanks so much for sharing.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#The sauce is thick and very tasty. The only negative I have is that, as others mentioned, the rice was not fully tender even after cooking longer than called for. Next time I make these (and we definitely liked them enough to make again), I will either try minute rice or else use precooked regular rice. I got 19 one and a half inch meatballs from a pound of ground beef.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Very good easy pleasy recipe. I'm thinking for the people that the rice didn't get done the meatballs were probably to big, Will make this again. 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I was so disappointed! The long grain rice did not get cooked inside of the meatballs even after an hour. My family tried to eat them but no one was able to finish or enjoy them since the texture was crunchy rice:( I did not see one other comment with the same problem. What did I do wrong?
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#My family loves these meatballs. We have them once a month, at least!
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Fabulous!!! I followed your recipe exactly, except doubled and added a can of rotel and one can of tomato sauce. Soooo delicious, and easy! Thank you!!
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Good recipe. Followed it exactly. Mixture was not holding together like I wanted so I did add an egg and some bread crumbs. That did the trick.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I make these with milk instead of water, and omit the brown sugar. I brown them and put them in pressure cooker for 20 minutes. I got a pressure cooker 49 yrs ago so I could make these for my husband.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Very similar to recipe from WWII using the rice to stretch the scarce meat.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#My mom used to make these back in the 70's. They are just as good as I remember. 
Porcupine Meatballs#1#0#This is a family favorite for us, has been since it was published in the cookbook many moons ago! My teen kids and in-laws (when visiting) request it often. The only thing I do different is omit the brown sugar, sometimes. Thanks for the recipe!
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#these took me back to my childhood! Tasty and warm/cozy feeling to eat. Scary/fascinating to look at. Even though i used marinara instead of homemade sauce they were great. also as leftovers.
Porcupine Meatballs#3#0#My family likes these meatballs a lot. I serve them with more rice (which they think is funny, but hey, you gotta fill up those boys somehow) I put them in the oven for about 20 min. instead of browning them in a skillet, then continue as the recipe says.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#These are soooo yummy!
Porcupine Meatballs#1#0#I have attempted porcupine meatballs before and they always fall apart and or the rice doesn't cook I used this recipe and it worked like a charm. I opted to bake the meatballs- followed recipe but instead of using a pot, placed in un greased baking dish and then covered in sauce. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes COVERED. Then uncovered and baked 35 more minutes. Flipped balls to other side and splashed some sauce on top after 15 minutes uncovered. Served with mashed potatoes and butter peas . My one year old and husband loved this meal. Keeper! 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Very good and so easy!!! Just like my mom used to make!!!
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#awesome been looking for this one
Porcupine Meatballs#1#0#I live in AK and I made these with MOOSE meat and OH MY GOODNESS it was so delicious. The moose meat just absorbs all the flavors, I will definitely be keeping and recommending this recipe.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#My husband says this is a keeper! Easy to make and delicious.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I used this same recipe back in the 70's to stuff green peppers. The extra meat became smaller porcupine meatballs . It's been years since I've made them...maybe tonight!! Thanks for the reminder. This is a great meal! 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Actually I had never heard of these before I made them today. My husbands mother used to make them when he was little so I used this recipe and he loved it! Will definitely make again.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I've loved these since my grandma made them for me when I was a little girl...45 years ago! I've made them often in my life but usually make the sauce from Cream of Mushroom soup with about 1/2 can of milk or water and a couple drops of Worcestershire added. To make it even easier (and the way my grandma did it), is to not brown the meatballs. Mix the meatball ingredients, shape into meatballs and put in an even layer in a casserole dish and pour the soup mixture over. Cook at 350, covered, for 30 minutes. Remove cover and cook for 30 more minutes. Then I put them on top of mashed potatoes, spoon sauce over all and enjoy! It's fun to watch people's faces when you tell them you're serving Porcupines too ;-) Now I'm hungry for these and have to go make them for dinner. 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Delicious and easy to make!
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I love these, I have been making them for my family for years. I use celery seed instead of celery salt, when I double the recipe, I only use the 1 tsp of salt. I also bake the meatballs, drain ,then pour the sauce over the meatballs, bake 20 minutes more.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I make these all the time for my family and they always turn out great! I like to serve them with mashed potatoes and corn.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Very Good. I doubled the recipe and will finely dice the onion next time. My 5 yr old son loved them!
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#We enjoyed these tasty meatballs. Easy to make, and I like the fact that you can fix the rest of the meal while they are simmering.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#made these for years but use tomato soup intead of tomatoe sauce
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#These were great meatballs in a tangy sweet sauce. I'll definitely make them again! 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I have been making these for at least 15 years or more. They are Really delicious. I think they were in an old TOH magazine.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Sorry about the long review. I need to stop drinking before posting. Use 4 Tsp of Worcestershire sauce ( not 4 Tbsp ). And after I returned the meatballs to the pan and covered with sauce, I also put a lid over my pan while it simmered in the sauce.
Porcupine Meatballs#1#1#We made this tonight following the recipe basically word for word. I simply doubled the ingredients because I just couldn't see 1 pound of hamburger filling up three people. We used white instant rice for the recipe and it worked great in my opinion.Two adults and our 16 year old daughter. She ate five of the twenty meatballs that I was able to make for the 2 pounds of burger. I browned in olive oil on medium high heat and basically just browned both sides because the 12 skillet was a little crowded. I removed the browned meatballs to a plate while I disposed of the grease from the pan. I also rinsed the pan with hot water once the grease was gone. I returned the meatballs to the pan and covered with the sauce (2x recipe for me).Simmered on a low bubble for 45 minutes (turning the meatballs a couple times). They were just great. I couldn't believe my daughter ate five of the twenty I made. My only suggestion is to take the time to make the meatballs evenly sized, and to be sure and mix the ingredients thoroughly before turning into meatballs. I suppose the only thing I changed was that I mixed only 3/4 cup of water to the ground beef and added two eggs. In the sauce I did not add the water at all, just the two 15 oz cans of tomato sauce, 4Tsp of Worchestershire sauce, and 4 Tbsp of brown sugar.15 of the 20 meatballs were eaten. Only due to stomach capacity of 3 satisfied Kansan's. We will make this more often. So easy! 
Porcupine Meatballs#1#0#I love this recipe! It reminds me of the meatballs my mom used to make when I was little. The only change I made to it was I added 3 tbsp of Worcestershire instead of 2 tsp and reduced the brown sugar to 1 tbsp - I really prefer a tangier sauce. you can also add a little cayenne to give it a little kick. Otherwise this recipe is perfect!
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#My children loved making these meatballs - I loved eating them! No hard to slip brown rice into this one either.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#When my youngest son was three (1996) he exclaimed, I'll have more delicious please! It has been a requested birthday meal favorite of his ever since. 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#These were really good. They turned out much more spikey and porcupine-looking than the picture shows.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Made this last night and the kids loved it. My son kept asking for more and normally you have to beg him to just take one more bite. I did make one change in the recipe, my husband does not like his food to be sweet so instead of the brown sugar I added about 1/2- 1 teaspoon of ginger, roughly, I did not measure. And I also made them in the pressure cooker without browning to save on time. Only had to cook them for 15-20 min. at 15 lbs of pressure.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Delicious!
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I have been making this ever since it appeared in your magazine years ago. This is one of our most favorite meatball recipe. The only thing I do different is add a little onion powder to the meatballs and I usually add a 8oz. can of tomato sauce because we like extra sauce. We love it withashed potatoes or potatoes I put through my river. DELICIOUS!!! We love the leftovers too :-)
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Yum! My aunt makes something very similer to these, and I've always loved her's. These are good too. 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#An easy to fix favorite with great flavor. Usually have all the ingredients in the pantry so it's a good, quick, and easy workday meal at our house. 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#While I think these would be fun for kids as the meatballs do take on a fun spiky porcupine look as you cook them, I only found them ok in taste. I think next time I would still make the meatballs with the rice but try a different recipe for the sauce. 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I liked the recipe because I had everything on hand; it did not take special ingredients. My family loved it!
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#This is tops in comfort food. I have to admit ,that the first time in my married life, I did not have tomato sauce on hand, so I used petite diced tomatoes I already had on hand. Ran them through the blender and it worked very well. These were even better (as many tomatoey recipes are) the next day as leftovers. Thanks so much. This is just what I was looking for.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#3#I can't quite figure out what all the excitement is about this recipe. It was just okay. I would prefer meatballs without rice anyday and the sauce wasn't great. I would far prefer spaghetti sauce or sweet and sour or mushroom or just about anything else. Won't make this again, but glad I tried it. 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Have made these many times. Inexpensive, easy, and delicious! Usually serve them over mashed potatoes. I also usually double the sauce, but I like the sauce to be a little less sweet, so I don't double the brown sugar. It's a winner every time I serve it. Thanks for sharing this great recipe! 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#This is a very good recipe. The only change I made was to add cut up green peppers to the sauce and, since I was out of onions, I replaced them with 3 tablespoons of dried, minced onion. The dried onion added very nice flavor. This recipe will make an excellent stuffed peppers recipe as well.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#A good recipe. I didn't change a thing. These would even be good as a meatball sub with hot peppers and cheese. This is a keeper. 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#These were great meatballs. With the rice in the meatballs and the tomato sauce, it kind of reminded me of cabbage rolls without the cabbage. I doubled the entire recipe and had just enough to feed two adolescent boys, their father, and myself
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#These are good. After reading the reviews I decided to double the sauce. I had only one can of tomato sauce so I used that and one can of petite cut tomatoes. I omitted the water since the canned tomatoes have a lot of water in them. It turned out great. My husband loved them and I usually don't get good reviews for my meatballs :) 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I doubled the sauce ingredients. This is a great freezer meal; I make extra meatballs which can be frozen, then thawed and browned.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#This is by far the best recipe I have ever gotten from Taste of Home. This is my six year olds favorite meal...and that says a lot since she is such a picky eater. This would be a great dish for a potluck or for a meal to impress your friends, family or co-workers!
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#My husband, who usually doesn't like meatballs, went back for seconds with these!!! They are great! 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#This recipe, served with the baked mashed potatoes, has been a number 1 favorite with my family and friends since it first appeard in the magazine in 1995.I always double or triple it and make twice as much sauce as called for per batch, yet there is never anything left!! The more I make, the more they eat!!!I use it for a new mommy gift, housewarming, welcome back, etc. It is always a hit! Thanks!!
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Delicious! I like to forego the tomato sauce occasionally and use a mushroom gravy instead.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Just like the ones my mom use to make. The whole family loves them, and there is never any leftovers.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#My mother-in-law use to make this for my hubby and I when we first got together and I just loved it. Over the years I have been trying different recipes so I could make it myself. I finally found a keeper. My picky child ate every bit of it with no complaints.I took a few of the reviews and doubled the tomato sauce, worcstershire sauce and brown sugar. It was excellent. Served with rice and green beans. Since I doubled the sauce I served it over the rice. Very yummy and will make it again. : )
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#I've been making this recipe since it first appeared in your magazine. THERE IS NOTHING FINER IN THE PORCUPINE RECIPE area! 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Delicious, I didn't have celery salt so used seasoning salt. Did double the sauce as well. Everyone cleaned their plates! 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#Oops..I meant Spinach Apple Salad.
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#This has been a family favorite for years. I make mine with lean ground turkey. And, I also make the Baked Mashed Potatos, which are delicious too. This recipe was in a TOH magazine that also include Emily's Spinach Salad as a side (with apple and raisens)...a very refreshing accompaniment to this meal. YUMMY!!! 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#1#This recipe rocks!!! Easy to make. I double the sauce though, doesn't seem to be enough. 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#The whole family loved these. I made extra and sent them to my sister-in-law and my brother-in-law said I could cook for him anytime. A big hit with everyone. Definitely a keeper!
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#These meatballs are wonderful! Very easy to prepare too. I served them with another TOH recipe for Baked Mashed Potatoes. Great meal!
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#These meatballs are great... our family loves them! We do substitute quick-cooking oats for the long grain rice, as oats are always in our cabinet, but they're perfect every time we make them. Truly... a wonderful recipe to have! 
Porcupine Meatballs#0#0#My husband loves these hearty meatballs! One time, I accidently doubled the Worcestershire sauce and it made them taste even better!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#This pudding was delicious. I omitted the nutmeg, only because I am not a nutmeg lover! I served it with vanilla ice cream. So yummy, warm from the oven. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Can you use almond milk instead of 2%? I don't know if it makes a difference or not! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Day 1, warm and delicious, with cream poured over it. Day 2, not as good, so eat it all the first day! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#0#This was outstanding and so easy to make! Everyone loved it and it smelled wonderful baking. Served it with ice cream and with whipped cream - both wonderful! Definitely a keeper!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#9#3#This recipe is so good! I added 1/2 cup chopped pecans to the top of the peaches before pouring the hot liquid over the top and baking. It was not too sweet and the pecans gave it a bit of crunch. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream at a dinner party with friends. Delicious!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#3#0#I made this tonight for dessert. I seen the recipe a couple days ago and it made my mouth water. It turned out pretty good.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#12#0#Mmmmm super good. We can make this recipe with any fruits. It's so good. Made it with blueberries, strawberries and apples.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#26#1#This recipe is FANTASTIC! I cut both sugars to 1/3 cup as we're trying to decrease our sugar intake and it didn't change the taste at all. It was plenty sweet and yummy with ice cream or cold milk. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#17#4#I'm going to try it with nectarines. It looks like a really great recipe. I would like eventually to swap out the sugar for stevia, but not sure of the ratio. Anyone help me? How much stevia and what else do I need to add instead of sugar. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#60#6#Made it for company tonight! I served it warm with vanilla ice cream. It was very good. I freeze peaches during the summer. When defrosted, they give a lot of peach juice. I used the peach juice, instead of the water called for in the recipe, to make the topping. After reading other reviews saying it was too sweet, I cut out the white sugar in the topping and used only the brown sugar. My husband said it was as good as my peach pie. It's much less time-consuming than making a pie so I'll be making it again! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#12#3#Wow! This recipe is excellent! I used gluten-free flour with great results! The peach mixture is so sweet and loved the topping!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#7#8#This was a delicious recipe, I used soy milk instead of normal milk and it was a good substitution! I also used canned peaches instead of fresh or frozen and it was still delicious - though I would say to reduce the amount of water in the topping by about 1/2 cup, and honestly I might suggest doing that anyways, it was a lot of liquid leftover.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#14#0#This is not a review. This recipe sounds so good I am going to try it. I was wondering if it would work with other fruit. I have been gifted a large amount of purple plums and am looking for a recipe for them.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#9#2#This was truly good but I changed one item - I used Pet Milk instead instead of the 2% milk. I Love it really, really rich, and this did the tick....
Tennessee Peach Pudding#17#0#This is perfect just the way it is. A definite keeper! Be sure to put something under the pan cause I now have to clean my oven.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#1#Delicious!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#12#0#This is delicious, I did heed another commenter and added less sugar, my hubby is pre-diabetic so just used brown sugar for topping. BUT my adult son was watching and he suggested I put a cookie sheet under it in the oven. SO GLAD I DID!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#8#0#This recipe is awesome. I made it in the winter and used canned peaches and it turned out fabulous. We did find it a little bit to sweet for our tastes, and my diabetic father. No big deal. I'll just cut back sugar next time. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#5#0#I found this recipe a week ago and have made three times already. My husband's favorite dessert by far. And, it's so simple to make. I've been buying fresh peaches for a week now, ready for new dessert, LOL ??
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#0#i am going to make this Saturday sound great
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#1#Delicious
Tennessee Peach Pudding#5#1#It's summer and the fruit is good. So what do I do with all of that healthy fruit? Make desserts of course! I bought some peaches yesterday and then went looking for a recipe to try. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this one. It turned out really well. The only tweek I made was to follow the suggestions of sprinkling lemon and sugar on the peaches, letting sit half and hour and using the bit of juice that accumulated in with the water part of the recipe. I don't think it made that much difference so following spot on should come out just as well. I didn't know what would happen with that water formula. But the top got all brown and crunchy, so good. And this was really easy to whip together on a Sunday afternoon. I will definitely make this again 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#14#2#I made the recipe with the ingredients and amounts exactly as listed. I thought the topping was going to overfill my baking dish (8x8 pyrex) after I poured about half of it in. I was contemplating transferring everything to a larger pan but after waiting a few minutes the liquid had soaked in enough to add the entire remaining amount. It is a MUST to let it cool off and set up or otherwise would have been soupy. Once cooled, it is a great pudding consistency. It is softer than a true cobbler but very good!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#4#0#This was great! The only mod i made was using a 7x11 baking dish. Definitely a keeper.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#9#2#I'm dying at the review below by Bob who subbed ingredients and then complained that it turned out bad. This is a fantastic recipe when you have fresh peaches in the summer. It's probably good with frozen or canned peaches too, but I save this for when I have fresh ones. For the topping, you need to let it boil for a bit and reduce before pouring on the batter, think like syrup or even a caramel consistency. I add a little corn syrup to the topping mix just to prevent any crunchy sugar bits. The cream as indicated by the recipe is good, but some ice cream I think is even better. If you have fresh peaches, this recipe is a must-try. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#27#I tried this recipe with some low carb ingredient replacements and it was a soupy, expensive mess. 1.5 cups of water is FAR too much. Use half a cup instead., Better yet, find another recipe that doesn't waste your time and money. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#8#I have a different version of the peach pie.may turn out the same.i put 1 cup of sugar 1 cup of selfrising flour and one cup of milk and mix them up. In a bowl I use canned peach's and pour The peach's in a 9x9 glass pan.i pour the sugar and flour mixture over the top of the peach's and add several butter pat on top and bake at 350 until top is brown.could turn out the same.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#6#2#My son made this for me for Mother's Day. We all thought it was fantastic. He used frozen peaches from our last year's crop. He partially defrosted the peaches, drained the juice, and added it to the water. He did not have an eight inch pan so he used a 7x 11. He baked it on convect with a cookie sheet on the rack below as it bubbled over. It came out beautiful and he served it with whipping cream. It is a keeper. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#2#4#This is amazing! I used frozen peaches from my last year's crop. So simple and the topping is so good! Comes out perfectly-served with heavy cream and a sprinkling of cinnamon sugar. Great way to use my peaches-will definitely make again! VFE 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#7#2#This is the recipe that our family has been using this for all the other cobblers that they made. I am 62 years young and I remember all family functions with were always just get together and everyone brought food. I remember back to my great-great- grandmother making it. The water is what makes it. It makes the crust so crispy and good.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#1#Way too much liquid for the topping. Turned out mushy and too sweet. I would try it again using half the topping.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#3#I want to try this recipe but don't know know whether vanilla ice cream would be used in place of or in addition to the half-and-half cream in the recipe. Also, how much half-and-half cream should be used? Thanks. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#This is a great easy to make recipe. It is best with fresh peaches but still good with frozen. Also I found out it is best to serve the day you make it. It is my go-to recipe for a peach dessert.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#This dessert was so easy to make. I made the recipe just as it is. The only thing I changed was I used frozen peaches as that was all I had. It turned out really, really good. I used a 2.5 quart corningware dish instead of my 8x8 baking pan because I was afraid it would bubble over.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#3#I made this for dessert with family. It was delicious! I used fresh peaches from the Farmers Market and this recipe did them justice! The pudding was the right balance of everything and served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream it was fantastic! I will make this over and over. Thanks!,,
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#0#No adjustments needed on this one! Absolutely delicious!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#1#Wow is this good! Followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use quite all of the glaze (was running out of room in the baking dish I was using!) I wouldn't change a thing! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#3#0#I made the recipe with only one slight change, I sliced the peaches, squeezed a little lemon juice & sprinkled sugar & let sit for 30 minutes. I drained the juice & added it to the water. I took it over to my neighbors & her husband started eating it out if the pan! They both said it was perfect. It seemed a little off, pouring the syrup over it...it just worked & turned out beautifully. I put the pan under it thinking it may bubble over but it didn't. Great use of fresh peaches! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#2#1#I made this Tonight. I only had canned peaches, I drained and reserved the juice, measuring out the juice to make 1 1/2 cups. Added the brown sugar only. It was amazing! The dough was almost crunchy on top. Hubby licked his bowl clean. My new fave!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#1#O. M. G. This is DEEE~LISH! And sooo easy. I used frozen peaches (thawed). Instead of water, I used the syrup from a can of peaches (did not use those peaches in the recipe) along with half & half until I had one and a half cups of liquid. Served mine with whipping cream. Oh, and those of you who do not understand why there is no measurement on the half and half at the end, it's because you're just supposed to pour it over the cobbler to your own liking. Also... It says serve warm or cold because you can serve the cobbler warm... or cold. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#0#My family raved about this recipe. It is now a favorite. I will definitely make this again and again
Tennessee Peach Pudding#2#0#Great tasting easy dessert! Made changes second time using canned peaches with juice since I ended up with fresh peaches that weren't good. Saved the juice and used it in the topping with half & half to make 1.5 cups needed. Also used only the brown sugar & two tablespoons butter instead of one with the nutmeg. Baked 40 minutes in 7x11 pan & no spills.Turned out great. Served it warm with more half & half. It was more creamy than when I used water in the topping. Everyone loved it. Much faster using canned peaches & still tasted great. Husband loves it both ways. Going to double recipe with glass 9x13 pan for Labor day picnic & bake it on my gas grill using an air bake cookie sheet under the cake pan so it won't burn. Thanks for a great recipe! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Awesome ??I wasn't expecting this to taste sooo good. Great texture not to sweet for my taste. I also added cream over the pudding that gave it that extraVavoom. I am in Atlanta and I used the fresh Ga peaches ?? I bought from the Grocery. I used a deep casserole dish and had no spills in the oven just perfect... my new go to Peach Pudding!!!!!! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#0#Great flavor, quick and easy. I substituted 1/2 cup of the water with peach liqueur for a little extra peach flavor. After trying many other cobbler recipes, my search is over!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Nothing like peach season in Colorado! I love finding ways to use up these large juicy peaches that are overflowing at the farmers markets. We served this pudding with ice cream and it was a big hit!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#0#Wonderful recipe for a quick and easy dessert! I only had canned peaches, so I used two cans of peaches in their own juice. I drained the juice and saved it. It made one cup exactly, so I used that to replace most of the water called for in the sauce you pour over the top. It came together so fast and it was absolutely scrumptious!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#0#This was really good. It does boil over and thank you to the person who suggested setting it in a larger pan to catch the drips. I think I will use a 9 pan next time. Do serve it warm with the cream - yummy!!!! To those readers who didn't know what to do with the cream, you pour it over the pudding before you eat it. Would be good with ice cream too. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#2#0#I have been searching for a good peach cobbler recipe. So many turn out like a cake with peaches in them. Dry. Not like I had growing up. My husband brought some fresh Palisade Colorado peaches home this past weekend from his trip and I searched again for a recipe that was not dry. I will search no farther. This was perfect!! My husband loved it!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#For my taste it was extremely sweet. It may be a good recipe if the sugar was cut in half.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#I doubled all the ingredients and baked in a 9x13 pan. It was full to the top, but only boiled over a little (thankfully, I followed other reviewers' suggestion and put a drip pan underneath). I refrigerated overnight and then warmed the next day and served with vanilla ice cream. Spectacular! I think chilling overnight helped firm it up and warming did not liquify it too much. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#0#This was extremely good. As for the cream and when to use it.....The last sentence states Serve warm or cold with cream . 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#2#Great recipe. Add more peaches (I used 4 cups). Other than that follow the directions. There is one mystery in this recipe, it list Half and Half cream but doesn't tell how much or when to use it. (I left it out). Amazing, will make many more times. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#3#The directions do not include the use of the half and half cream! Should it be included in the sauce?
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Excellent dessert! Served it with vanilla ice cream on top and it was delicious!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#3#1#If I use frozen peaches. I do thaw them correct
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#0#I never thought this would work.. honestly. I thought it would be too mushy and weird . I was SO wrong and I'm so glad I tried it. The peachy-cake mixture cooked up nicely and the sweet topping made the dish just creamy enough. I made my own whipped cream using coconut milk to serve and it was truly one of my favorite desserts. I will be making this very often! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Love this!!! First time I used white nectarines and it tasted great but looked a little bland. Used yellow peaches the next time and it was perfect. I think I will use a few more peaches next time I make it. As my husband says, THIS IS A KEEPER!! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Delicious! I used a combination of plums and nectarines. I used half white, half whole wheat flour, and palm sugar. II agree it was delicious cold the next morning. It was like a delicious compote with built in cake. Great way to use up stone fruit that's past its prime. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#2#GOT SOME FRESH PEACHES THIS WEEK AND LOOKED FOR A RECIPE AND FOUND THIS ONE. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! HAD FOR DESSERT ABOUT 1/2 HOUR AFTER DINNER AND IT WAS STILL WARM AND SERVED WITH WHIPPED CREAM. DEFINITELY A KEEPER! YUMMMM BY THE WAY, I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE EXACTLY EXCEPT ADDED MORE PEACHES, ABOUT 5 CUPS IN ALL.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#1#My husband and I absolutely LOVED this. We did cut it in half because that's all the peaches we had.Originally, I was going to take the advice of other reviewers and back off on the topping, especially since the peaches we had were very ripe and extremely juicy. However, I forgot to do that, and instead just made it as-is. When it came out of the oven, I was disappointed. It was a big mess, and there was definitely too much liquid. I put all the leftovers in the fridge for another night.When I pulled them back out a couple days later, I have to say that I fell in love with this dish!! It tastes a million times better cold, and the cold actually helped it firm up; it was no longer liquid-y. It reminded me of a delicious bread pudding (almost). I can understand why some people are disappointed, but give this a chance as-is. If you don't like it, then make adjustments for your next trial ;) 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#This is a delicious way to use fresh peaches. It comes together quickly, doesn't use many ingredients, and is really an impressive and comforting dessert. I served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, but will try drizzling cream instead next time, as the recipe suggests. This will be a regular summer recipe for my family going forward. I also like that it doesn't make a huge amount.....Enough for company, or a couple of nights of dessert for just my family. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#This was fantastic. I added nutmeg but otherwise followed recipe. If you were to use apples instead of peaches it would taste like apple dumplings but way easier.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#This was excellent. I did add more peaches. My husband said it was a keeper. I did add 1 tsp almond extract to topping. It was different than a cobbler but so good. I will sure make it again many times.To the person who said they had trouble pealing peaches. I learned a trick many years ago. Just put peaches in boiling water for about 30 seconds than in cold water and the skin just peals right off. I use to can bushels of peaches and that trick helped save a lot of time.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Good Flavor, a little too sweet, needs more peaches.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Very good. My first attempt using fresh peaches. Found it a little difficult slicing the peaches off the pit.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Delicious and very peachy! I made this yesterday, doubled the recipe, and there's only a small portion left. Family loved it! I used canned peaches and used the peach syrup in the topping along with the water to make the required amount of liquid, and eliminated the granulated sugar from the topping. Can't wait to try it with fresh peaches. Great, easy recipe, a keeper for sure! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#0#This recipe was awesome! I followed it exactly and it came out perfect. I baked for the full 50 minutes. I added sparkling sugar on top and made it look extra special.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#0#This is AMAZING!!! Followed the recipe exactly with no issues. Used 8 x 8 glass pan and it did not run over. I had some frozen peaches and I used these. Left them out to thaw for about 10 minutes and they were perfect. I do believe I will replace the nutmeg with cinnamon the next time. Just not a big nutmeg fan!! Thanks for sharing!!! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#What a great way to use fresh peaches. My husband and I have been trying recipes we can bake on the grill. This recipe worked great!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#This was quite good. I used one 600g bag (3 cups) of frozen peaches, thawed. We did find it a bit too crusty for us, but tasty nonetheless.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#4#followed recipe. oven temp needs adjusted. Turned out to be a peach mush 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#yummiliciousness!!!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#0#Ha! Ha! Ha! Did anyone notice the recipe's name has pudding not cobbler in it? Maybe that had something to do with some's expectations. Whatever, it's marvelous! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#I made this cobbler for a family BBQ using fresh peaches. I followed the recipe exactly, even thought it sounded crazy and it turned out phenomenal ! It was great with 1/2 and 1/2 or homemade whipped cream or both together! Everyone wants me to bring it again.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#2#0#Dilogsdon: the cream is an additional topping that you put on when your ready to eat it (as much or as little or none as you want).
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#2#The topping calls for half-and-half cream. How much? It does not give a measurement in the recipe.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#This recipe is a great way to jazz up a traditional peach cobbler. I used preserved peaches, so I cut back the sugars to 1/3 cup each. The warmth from the spices and the comfort from the topping and syrup makes the perfect cold weather treat!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#I made this for a family gathering. Never having made this recipe before, I tripled the amounts and baked it in a 1/2 sheet cake pan. It was fantastic. Yes, I was a little alarmed adding in simple sugar liquid and seeing how full the pan was getting. But I had already read the recipes of people who didn't add all of the liquid. It came out of the oven bubbly and smelling amazing. I had many people ask me for the recipe. I'm going nto make it for a potluck that my office is hosting before Thanksgiving. I know they will love it as much as my family did. =) 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#3#1#We had this last night for dessert and it was DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly.....did cut down on the sugar in the topping to about a third cup of each the brown and white sugars....maybe will reduce them down even more when I make this again..... and put it in an 11 x 7 inch baking dish (it still bubbled over a bit). I can't see why one person thought it had too many flaws and why some are so spooked by the fact that there's one and a half cups of water in the topping! There are many dessert recipes where you use a lot of liquid like this to pour over the main part of the dessert....it combines with the flour and creates that lovely thick sauce that was underneath the cake-like topping and peaches. Someone even contemplated leaving the topping off....that would be disastrous! Follow the recipe as it's written, use nice, juicy ripe peaches, and it makes a terrific cobbler. Of course, there's the matter of taste......not everyone agrees completely about how something tastes to them, but there are no flaws in this recipe. It's going into my best-loved file of recipes and I'll be making it many times in the future! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Great dessert! I will make this again as it was very easy to make. I used only Cinnamon for the mixture and the topping as we don't care for Nutmeg. The only trouble I ran into was that it bubbled over while in the oven. So be sure there is a drip pan while baking. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#I made this for a family reunion recently and it was a tremendous hit! Used frozen peaches from our own tree and substituted the juice from the peaches for the water. Delicious!!!!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Delicious! My husband had 2 helpings! The top came out a perfect golden brown. The only change I would make is maybe add a little more cinnamon for a stronger flavor.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#My husband and I loved this. I recommend this to my Facebook friends. Would make this again.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#3#0#I don't bake much and when I do bake something it doesn't usually turn out very good. This was the exception. I made it exactly as the recipe stated except I used frozen peaches - thawed. I did think the topping was too much but used it anyway. At the end of the cooking time it still was not done per the toothpick method. I put it back in the oven and actually forgot about it. I'm guessing it was half an hour later when I realized I had a cobbler in the oven. I ran to the kitchen expecting to see smoke coming from the oven and a burnt cobbler inside. But it was perfect, a nice golden brown crust. I was using a glass pan and it looked like it was soupy under the topping, but after setting for a little bit the juice thickened up. This tasted like a restaurant quality cobbler. My 87 year old mom raved about it. She now thinks I can bake. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Tasty.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#I made this for a 4 of July block party. I doubled the ingredients and pour into a 9x13 pan. I was out of nutmeg so I used pumpkin spice instead plus I put some spice into the flour as well.  Came out wonderful. I got lots of compliments on it.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Thanks Red Hat Milli. I read that three times and did not even see that. Have a great July 4th! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#I was able to use only 1/2 of the topping before it overflowed by 8x8 pan. It never did completely cook. However, I will try it again with some adjustments.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#0#This is an answer to 1camsgram question regarding where cream is used. I'm thinking it is used at serving time of the cobbler. In the ingredients list it is half & half CREAM. In the directions it is referred to as CREAM on top of cold or hot cobbler. I'm guessing it is poured on as desired. It quite easily could be replaced with ice cream or a whipped topping. Hope this helps. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#2#I just took it out of the oven and I can already tell this is a winner! Taking it to a church dinner today....I did modify the recipe just a bit. I tripled the flour, sugar, milk and used 3 cans of peaches. I also used self rising flour. I reserved the juice from the canned peaches, using 1 1/2 cups of the juice and only 1/2 cup brown sugar and butter with a dash of cinnamon for the liquid'topping'. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Oh my this was delish! I had to improvise as some of my fresh peaches had gotten devoured without my knowledge, so I added frozen berry mixture to make up the 3 cups. I made one tiny boo boo, I plopped the brown sugar into the flour mixture. I managed to scoop out most of it, but I have to say it that little bit of brown sugar made the cobbler a nice brown, and there was a delightful slight crunch. It came out beautiful and everyone loved it! Served it warm with homemade French vanilla ice cream on top. TDF!!!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#2#Where does the half n half come in. I am not seeing any directions for it.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#1#I think the difference in results may be due to how'ripe' the Peaches may have been. Lots of'juice' as you slice, cut the extra fluid down accordingly. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Grew up with this cobbler in PA, also substitute cherries or blueberries for the peaches. No other cobbler tastes as good as this recipe.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#very simple and easy to bake
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#With fresh peaches in right now, I have been making several desserts with them and sharing with friends. The 3 friends and I who ate this really like the way the peach flavor came through and liked the texture of the cobbler crust. I would make it again. I drop my fresh peaches in boiling water for about 20 seconds, then into ice water and peeling them is a breeze.Pat Hockett, Field editor
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#1#I liked the fact that it was small. As for the recipe, I cut the water in half and used half white @ half brow sugar with the peaches. I wild have liked the top to have been more crisp.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#2#I doubled recipe but only used half the sauce. It came out perfect! Plus it was delish with a scoop of Blue Bunny Ice Creme!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#1#I was so worried when I saw how liquidy mixture was but followed directions as specified. Though I substituted milk for vanilla almond milk. I read through prior reviews and did put a pan under bc it does boil over. I cooked it 400 for 40mins and all the liquid became a very thick sauce/syrup. It's SO good tastes like a bakery made this item. Not too sweet, peaches soaked up all the good flavor, sauce thickened/reduced to jelly like consistency. Next time I think I will cook 35 mins or lower heat bc breaking cooked slightly harder then I prefer. Also I made to small carafes from same batch so I'd have testers. They came out perfect cooked along side of larger pan. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Peaches are in season and I just made this recipe. It is a very easy recipe to follow and to make. End result...awesome! I certainly will be making again and highly recommend this recipe!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#This is my go to recipe for peach cobbler. Absolutely delicious!!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#3#I just finished eating 2 small bowls (fresh out of the oven!) and my oh my was it tasty. Although I didn't follow the recipe to a T. I had to use bread flour because I was out of all-purpose (crazy, I know). I also used brown sugar instead of white. I used 3 fresh peaches, peeled/sliced and added 3/4 cup of fresh blueberries. Upon reading the reviews I decided to go with my own topping recipe.... I used a half stick of butter, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a splash of milk. It made a saucy caramel. I drizzled half of it over the batter and baked it at 400 for appx. 30 min. Until the top was browned and I could stick a toothpick in and not have any batter on it. VERY VERY GOOD. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#It was good.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Made this for Thanksgiving, used frozen peaches. It came out saucy but very flavorful, and my 85-year old mom says this recipe is a keeper.  
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Am making again tomorrow! I didn't have enough room in the baking dish for all the sauce which I think worked out better, was a thick bread-pudding like texture instead of too saucy like some are saying. When you put this in the oven it doesn't seem like it will come out well but it was perfect and very tasty. Will keep this forever! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Loved this cobbler with lots of sauce. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Yummy!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#2#0#When I closed the oven door on this concoction I was pretty sure I had wasted some nice ingredients. Forty-five minutes later, I opened the door to one of the best peach cobblers I have ever had. The top was crisp, there was plenty of sauce, the peaches cooked perfectly. Highly recommend this recipe.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Excellent peach cobbler and the recipe was so easy. Will try it with blueberries or blackberries next time!!!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#2#This turned out for me more like a coffeecake than a cobbler. It set solid after baking-but I will make this again. I combined 2 cups flour, 1 cup sugar, 4 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, added 1 cup milk & folded in 6 cups sliced (not peeled) fresh peaches. Put this in a 9X13 glass dish. Then I made the topping in a saucepan using 2 cups of water, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 Tablespoons butter, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg & 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Brought this to a boil, stirring until sugars dissolved. Poured over the top. Baked at 400 for 40-50 minutes.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#The flavor was very good, however, it was so saucy that it made me think it was not done. I think I'd cut in half the topping mixture. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#This was delicious - made it as dessert for our annual summer picnic. Everyone loved it and requested the recipe! Thanks TOH
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#I made this cobbler this afternoon. I cannot get over how GOOD it is!!! This recipe is a keeper.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#1#This is the recipe I will use for all cobblers from now on! I had my doubts when I placed the wet, gooey mess in the oven that 2 cups of liquid would ever soak in. This is the best cobbler I've ever had .... and I even replaced both the white and brown sugars with Splenda. 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Sharon - I'd love to try this recipe as you and a few others rated it quite highly.  However there are a few that really gave it a super bad rating.  My philosophy is cook once and eat twice .  I, too, like to double and triple recipes and place the extra in the freezer for times when I have nothing prepared for a meal.  You tripled the recipe for 2 9x13 pans. This is something I'd do also.  Did you make any other alterations other than boiling the liquid a bit? I am anxious to try this, but would like to hear from you first.  Thanks so much.  
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#1#We don't like really sweet deserts. Do you think this would work without the topping? 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#Excellent! Goes really good with a little half&half. I had really sweet South Carolina peaches so I cut the sugar and brown sugar and water in half. Also deleted the nutmeg and cinnamon. We like a lot of crust so next batch plan to double the flour mixture. Easy to make and just a wonderful cobbler. Definitely a keeper!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#I tripled the recipe and used two 9x13 glass pans. I also let the liquid boil for a few minutes which I think contributed to thickening. I like to freeze individual portions. I was a bit concerned when pouring the liquid on top because it seemed like it was too much, but it worked out well. I like the way it bakes into a mixture of cake and sauce. The flavor of nutmeg and cinnamon is wonderful. I've tried many peach cobbler recipes and this will not be my favorite. Yummy!! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#OMG!! The best, easiest, and tastiest peach cobbler I've ever made. If you have sweet peaches, nothing more is needed outside of the listed ingredients. Thank you! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#I made this for my family and we ate the entire cobbler!! Sooo yummy and easy to make!!! I will definitely be making this again!!!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#3#This recipe has too many flaws, needs more sugar; some flour for thickening; and re-evaluate the amount of water...I doubled the ingredients which was a big mistake also.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#I thought this was going to be better than my Mom's, WRONG! I'm sorry to say, don't try it, I wasted a lot of good peaches, sorry! 
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#0#I made this for the 4th of July. My husband said it was the best cobbler he had ever had! It is easy and good. The nutmeg and cinnamon make it stand out.
Tennessee Peach Pudding#0#1#Easy and delicious!
Tennessee Peach Pudding#1#0#I searched the web for a peach cobbler recipe and was glad to find this one. The recipe is easy to make and absolutely delicious. My picky grandson had four servings and everyone raved about it. Thank you.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#If I made this again, I would reduce the butter by half, it was too greasy for me. Taste was ok but not good enough to make again.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#These are fantastic! Will be a regular addition to my Christmas Cookie list.
Caramel Heavenlies#1#1#Discustingly good...and EASY to make!!
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I fixed these when they first appeared in TOH. They were a hit!
Caramel Heavenlies#1#0#I used 2 cups of chopped pecans and about 2 cups of marshmallows. They are delicious!
Caramel Heavenlies#2#0#I have made these many times since they appeared in the Taste of Home magazine. They are quick, easy and never fail. I will advise measuring the interior of your pan. I have two pans sold as 15x10. One measures 15x10 on the interior and one measures 15x10 on the exterior which makes it smaller. I like to use my (larger) 15x10 pan and increase the butter and sugar to 1 cup each.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I have made Carmel Heavenlies many times. The first time was when I received Taste of Home magazine. I took them to a bake sale and included the recipe . Was a great hit.. 
Caramel Heavenlies#1#0#Tastes OK but is very messy and crumblyWould not make again
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#A very rich dessert. My grandmother has had a recipe for something similar with graham crackers, the butter sauce and sliced almonds baked like this one that my family has always loved. This one is has the added coconut, marshmallows and cinnamon. I will make it again.
Caramel Heavenlies#2#0#These are easy and very yummy,,I always spray the foil with pam.They are always a hit
Caramel Heavenlies#1#0#loved these....
Caramel Heavenlies#0#1#Good but real sweet cut into small sections. A little goes a long way!s came back to give more stars. It grew on me and I was sad it was gone, I'm making more. I did not like that it was sticky did not come out like a hard bar but was tasty 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#These were so good!! Made a pan before lunch and my husband & I couldn't stop with just one serving. A keeper for sure!! 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I just pulled this out of my recipe clips file last night to make for this holiday season. I don't recall changing a thing when I made them for the first time last year, and they came out great! I plan to double this year since my fam went crazy over these...fool proof, simple and yummy; my kind of recipe! Also follow the previous reviewer's advice about lining the pan with foil. That made it a lot easier to get it out cleanly. 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#Made this for the first time recently to take to a function. It was a hit! I recieved requests for the recipe. I used an extra 1/2 cup of marshmallows, but other than that, I did not alter the ingredients. However, if you truly use a pan with an interior measurement of 15 x 10, you will need a couple of extra graham crackers (trim with a knife) to fill the small gap at the bottom of pan. Fill the pan so the graham crackers don't shift around during baking. As another reviewer suggested, make sure there is an overhang of foil on the short ends for removal from pan, spray the foil with nonstick spray, and do not overcook the butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture (only a minute after the butter is melted and sugar is incorporated into the butter). Watch the baking time carefully after the 12 minute mark. At 12 minutes, mine had browned only at the edges and not in the middle. Try to get to an overall golden brown without letting the outside edges get too overdone. I let it cool for about 15 min and then removed it from the pan by holding the 2 ends of the foil. I let it cool completely and then cut as directed with a sharp knife. The pizza cutter idea didn't work well for me. I will absolutely make this again. 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#These were so easy and quick to make. My husband likes them better than my toffee! I'm taking them to my church for a bake sale. I flipped them over on wax paper and cut them in rectangles the size of the grahams I'll be making another batch for us soon! 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I actually had prepared these treats before and I prepared them again 12/6/14 since I had miniature marshmallows which I needed to use up! I did line the 15x10x1 baking pan with heavy-duty foil. I didn't need to coat with cooking spray as I used the caramel mixture!I just used 1 cup chopped pecans/walnuts combined, rather than almonds this time around.I also baked the treats 15 minutes and the marshmallows puffed nut nice and brown!What I had done this time was melt the butter, then add the brown sugar and cinnamon and mixed together. I then added the vanilla extract. These are very festive cookie treats for any holiday, actually! Thank you for sharing this recipe with Taste of Home! delowenstein 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#this recipe is amazing. However, i change it up a little by replacing the nuts with pretzel pieces. it is the perfect sweet and salty treat.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#These were delicious and easy to make!
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#Was quite surprised - these are actually pretty good. They are crunchy with great flavor and texture and you don't even notice the bottom layer is graham cracker. 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#So good, I used light brown sugar like someone else recommended and had to cut big marshmallows into small (grocery store had no more minis) kept everything else the same and they were awesome
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#Really good but really sweet, bars should be cut very small.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I made this recipe three times all summer long and these are my observations. First and foremost, if you follow my recommendations, you will not have any problems at all, despite what others say here. What I did is use Reynolds (brand) Release Foil (make sure dull side is facing up) in the 10X15X1 pan. MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE ENOUGH FOIL HANGING OVER THE SHORT ENDS TO LIFT THE COOKIES OUT OF THE PAN LATER. I ALSO sprayed it with nonstick cooking spray very lightly. I made sure all of the graham crackers fit properly in the pan (trim using a paring knife if need be--it's much easier than you think). Once the crackers are in the pan properly, I did use more than two cups of mini marshmallows...probably 2-1/2 cups total--enough to cover all of the crackers sufficiently. Then what I did is I used 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of light brown (not dark brown) sugar. Make sure you use real butter and fresh brown sugar. I cooked it precisely 1 minute after the butter melted. I think what a lot of cooks are doing is cooking the butter and brown sugar mixture too long. This will cause the cookies to not turn out like they are supposed to (I know from experience). I used 1-1/2 teaspoons of GOOD cinnamon (like Penzey's Celyon) and good, double strength vanilla extract. I also put a PINCH (no more) of salt in the caramel mixture. When it is cooked, I transferred the entire caramel mixture into a Pyrex measuring cup and poured it very carefully over the marshmallows so nothing puddled. Then I topped with the coconut and almonds and baked for 12 minutes and then checked it. My oven tends to be a bit psychotic, so it only takes about one minute more in mine to brown. When you take the cookies out of the oven, you will see that the marshmallows look like they are not cooked all the way. Don't worry. They will finish melting when you take them out of the oven. Remove pan from oven and place on a towel on table or counter for five minutes. Then lift cookies out by short ends with the foil overhang and place back on table or counter for five minutes or so (depends on temperature in your house at the time). Then lightly spray a large pizza cutter with nonstick spray and use the pizza cutter to slice through the cookies--don't remove from pan right away--just slice. Then let cool completely and put in a very loosely covered container. They won't last long enough to go stale. Not to worry. People are having problems with these cookies because, I think, they are cooking the caramel way too long. Even a minute too long is tooo long. I hope this helps you guys so that you will try it--even try it again, if you didn't like the way they turned out the first time. Happy baking! 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#Quick, easy and GREAT!
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#Me and my family didn't really like these.. I've made similar squares and they were so delicious but no one really liked these ones. Will not be making these ones again 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#these were a big hit at a Boy Scout function.even people who don't like coconut loved them. I will be making these again 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#Thought this would be a quick addition for Christmas Plates and was so surprised how VERY GOOD they were. A hit with me (easy) and the family (so good)!
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#This recipe was SO good and very easy!!! Love it, will make it again very soon.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#These are a hit whenever I make them for a group, and so easy!
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#These are awesome and so fast to make. They disappear instantly wherever I take them. I have been making these for a year already and always requested to bring them for events.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I've made this recipe several times now and it is a hit at our church dinners. Be sure to line the pan with foil and use a cookie sheet that has a lip all around the edges or you'll have a mess. Well worth the trouble - I always get requests for the recipe. 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#too sweet for my taste and not as good as I thought they would be...very disapointed...will not make again
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#Added chocolate chips on top. Really delicious!
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I liked this recipe very much, but I added chocolate morsels and the kids loved them,as a matter of fact, so did the adults!!
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#these are to die for. once you starting eatting them you can't stop. thank you to rayemi for tell me to sray the foil and to score them after 5 min and the remove after 10 min. I have another recipe like this that stick to the foil and that was the trick. they scored so easy and came out without any problem. watch out you might eat the whole pan yourself. 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#OMG!!! This is so delish... everyone ask for the recipe and it couldn't be easier to make! 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I have been making this recipe since seeing it in TOH years ago. I spray the foil with nonstick spray and bake for about 18 minutes, just until the marshmallows are lightly browned. When they come out of the oven, I let them cool for about 5 minutes and then score them. I let them cool about 10 minutes more and then remove them from the foil onto a cooling rack. The first time I made them I let them cool completely and the foil stuck, making them inedible. I've also noticed that the longer I cook the sugar/butter mixture in the saucepan, the crispier the cookies turn out. These are a hit wherever I take them, and I have many requests for the recipe. 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#made a few changes to this sweet..simple..tasty treat; litely buttered foil, then placed graham crackers to foil. added 3/4 cup of milk chocolate & peanut butter morsels. topped the marshmellows w/ morsels, coconut, pecans, and crumbled 2 sheet of graham crackers sprinkled over top..baked 15 minutes. WONDERFUL & EASY DESSERT. for the holiday color coconut w/ red or green food coloring!!bbrinson, thomasville, ga
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#This are absolutely divine! I don't make these often because I'll just eat them all :-) 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#i cant take these to any event without someone asking me for the recipe.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#i cant take these to any event without someone asking me for the recipe.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#These are great. My husband who is not a cookie eater lovedthem. So easy to makemarilyncooks, NC
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#Wow, these are amazing! The marshmellows melt into the carmel mix, which leaves the graham crackers soft and slightly chewy. It's delicious! I sprayed the foil with non-stick and didn't have any problems with sticking. 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#        
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I tried these cookies for Thanksgiving. I used foil in the pan and the whole batch stuck to it. They didn't cut like the picture. Too messy! 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#These are wonderful. Read the postings so sprayed with cookies spray incase of sticking. But made a second batch and they didn't need it. Really a nice sweet, crunchy, candy-like pretty cookie/bar for when you need to bake for a bake sale or holiday event!! A DEFINATE thumbs up! 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#The caramel heavenlies were absolutely heavenly. My family enjoyed them immensely - they couldn't believe they were light. I definitely will be making them again. 
Caramel Heavenlies#2#0#First time I didn't have correct size pan and they turned out well. Second time I used correct size pan and there wasn't enough carmel to cover. I gave the recipe to 2 others and they both failed and dumped it. Flavor was good but did not turn out as expected. 
Caramel Heavenlies#1#0#I used Splenda Brown sugar(1/2c.) instead. These were so good I put most of them in the freezer to slow us down-guess what-they are really good frozen.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I've been making these for several years now. Everyone loves them and they are so quick and easy to make. They certainly live up to their name. 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#These were a hit with my children and grandchildren.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#These were really really good but won't make them again..they were too messy and not real easy to deal with while trying to put them together...sure was worth a try though!!!! 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I made this for a get together after church last Sunday night. It was a big hit.  I was asked for the recipe and happily gave it.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#OH MY GOSH!!!! My family and I loooooved this recipe! I made it on a whim & they had the entire recipe gone by the next night. This is a good one - thank you! JLC
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#These are delicious and very easy to make!Barb252
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#This tasted just like the Girl Scout carmel delight cookies!!! Yummy :-)
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#Scrumptious!
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#These were very easy to make and very tasty. I increased marshmallows to 3 cups as 2 barely covered the crackers. I brought them to work and got excellent review. Quick to assemble.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#Fantastic! The first batch disappeared so quickly, I made another. I didn't have any more coconut so I substituted chocolate chips... and they were even better! This recipe is definitely a keeper. 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I made these and took them to the pharmacy where I work and everyone had one and wanted the recipes. I printed 12 copies and an additional 12 the following day.They were WONDERFUL!!!!!!Lilyorlola from Fl.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#Great tasting, super easy to prepare. I made half the recipe because I didn't have enough graham crackers on hand and my husband and I ate most of them in one sitting! I'll certainly make them again and again! The lady who thought they were a little dry must have baked them too long. They are super chewy.lindalou 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#The recipe over all is good. I think it is a little dry. It was easy to prepare and my husband loved it.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#Quick, easy to make, taste great and was loved by all who I shared with.Many requested my recipe . I was almost embarassed to tell them how easy it was to make:) Lee Warmbrodt 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#THESE WERE VERY EASY TO MAKE, I USED PARCHMENT PAPER INSTEAD OF FOIL AND WAS ABLE TO ROLL ANY SPILLOFF OF CARAMEL BACK ONTO THE CRACKERS. EVERYONE LOVED THE TASTE, SAID REMINDED THEM OF CARNIVAL ROASTED ALMONDS
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#Since my family does not care for coconut, I left it off and put pecan pieces on half and sliced almonds on half. They were great and so easy.Connie from Missouri
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I MADE THIS DISH BUT I CHANGE IT UP A LITTLE. I USED PECAN PIECESINSTEAD OF THE ALMONDS. IT WAS A HIT WITH ALL. WILL HAVE TO DO THISAGAIN .M. Wiggins
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I made them but I think I cooked them to long. They are good and we can eat them but 15 minutes is not long enough to cook them and 20 minutes is to long. I will try again. FancyBetty
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#Had several people say they liked it. Next time I'll bake it a little longer for a crisper bar. 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I did make them. Flavor wise they are great but the majority of it stuck to the aluminium foil and they were a mess to take apart.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I had to make bars for two community events. These were such a hit at the first event that I made the same recipe for the second event also.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#These were outstanding! So simple, but soooo good. I gave the recipe to almost everyone I know.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#My family and friends thought these were amazing. They taste more difficult than they were. Will definitly make again.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#Needs a little more caramel filling, but the taste is great and very good
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#This is most definitely a new family favorite! Very quick and easy to make. As soon as these came out of the oven I sprinkled some mini-chocolate chips on top - mmmmmmmm. I'm making them again this weekend! 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#These were wonderful! I took them to a church function and everyone wanted the recipe! Will definitely make these again!
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#these cookies are out of this world - thus the heavenlies 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I first found this recipe in your magazine YEARS ago and have been making them ever since - EVERYONE LOVES them!! I have added extra cracker pieces to the end as well and this year I believe the crackers themselves are being made smaller - I used 14 whole crackers. I find it easier to cut them by taking the foil/cookies from the pan, put on a cutting board and using a pizza cutter! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#Many thanks for the ideas!
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I made these and they were very good. I think I am going to make them as part of my holiday gifts. I did not have a problem with them stitcking to the foil, but they did burn along the edges where the sauce ran off the crackers. Next time I am going to put enough crackers to fill the entire pan since I could use smaller pieces of crackers along the edges. I did not cut them either, I just broke them into pieces. I may add more coconut too. Thank you for the recipe.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I haven't made these but probably will and will solve the sticking to the foil problem by using parchment paper instead. Nothing sticks to it so it should be a good solution. 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I found the recipe very tasty, but about half stuck to the foil and those were pretty much unusable as far as serving them. What do you do to get them off the foil easier? I placed the graham crackers very close together. 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0# Sorry I misread the calories, but still looking at the ingredients they are not as bad as some ingredients in cookies are. Lets face it gooood cookies are not going to be low in fat and good for us. So if we can at least cut some of the fat out that helps.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0# I don't understand why you would not consider these cookies light. I attend ww and I would consider these light compared to other cookies. 3 grams per 100 calories so fat grams is okay for the calories 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#I have made these many times from the original magazine recipe. Every person I have shared them with has loved them, my family the most. Thanks for the recipe.
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#Why, oh why, does TOH Light continue to offer high fat recipes on the site called light ? PLEASE lighten them before putting them on your light site! Are you listening, TOH? Thank you!Bonne Sue 
Caramel Heavenlies#0#0#These sound WONDERFUL - but I wouldn't consider them light . 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#I made these yesterday for dinner today. Served with homemade pasta fagioli. I used white sharp cheddar cheese rather than Swiss and used regular slider buns. Wow, so good, full of flavor. My family loved them too.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#23#This sounds really good, and I haven't made it yet. However, with that been, horseradish sauce is a lot different than prepared horseradish. Prepared is a lot stronger than the sauce. You can mix the prepared with the mayo and it would be the same thing as the sauce. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#2#0#These are easy to make and would be great for anything from a weeknight dinner to a Super Bowl party. They are yummy with the horseradish, but you can also substitute that with mayonnaise if horseradish isn't your favorite! 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#Delicious!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#6#0#These are a hit every time I make them! A family favorite. I don't use the horseradish since my family doesn't like it!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#57#8#We have made this recipe several times and enjoy it! Sometimes have soggy rolls-how can I prevent this?
Ham and Swiss Sliders#13#7#I read the reviews and decided to go easy on the horseradish sauce as well. I added more to my serving because, as the saying goes, you can always add more, but you can't take it out. This was as easy to make as presented. I did separate my portions in the baking pan (which added a couple minutes only), and this make serving easier. The sandwiches baked up warm and tasty. I gave it 4/5 stars because my husband found the sweet/savory too sweet. I will definitely make again but use less brown sugar. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#16#15#I LOVE horseradish but family doesn't. I mixed 1/4 c. horseradish sauce with 1/4 c. mayo. I think it needs horseradish. I put horseradish on the table and we, who loves it, added more. I don't prefer the sweet Hawaiian rolls but I did use them as they are the rage and seems everyone loves them. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#29#9#IF YOU HAVE A SERIOUS SWEET TOOTH: I didn't enjoy the horseradish flavor. Just a personal preference, but next time I'll use mayo instead. I doubled the sauce & used a pkg of 8 sweet rolls. I had to put 2 of them in a pan all by themselves, which turned out to be a happy accident because it left more space around them for the sauce to caramelize so when you cut to separate them, more of the thin, crispy-chewy sauce stuck around the edges. So you got more of the savory-sweet chewy toffee for each sandwich. Next time I make them, I'll bake fewer in each pan so this will happen to all of them. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#34#9#These were delightful. I've made them several times. Every time I've substituted the poppy seeds for Everything but the bagel seasoning and a few times I've mixed the Creamed horseradish with a bit of mayo. It's delicious and the family loves it every time. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#19#0#These were absolutely the best ever! The horseradish sauce makes the sandwich. I use creamy horseradish. I have also made these with mayo and Dijon mustard mixed together when I did not have any on hand. There are plenty of combinations you could use to make them to your likings. I prefer the original recipe though. Everyone raves about them when I do make them. I would not change a thing! In face, I am making them next week for my daughter and her family.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#17#1#Soooo delicious. I didn't think my husband would like it but he ate 4 buns! Super quick to put together. I didn't let it sit at all just popped it right in the oven. Will definitely be making again 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#9#17#I'd skip the horseradish. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#4#0#Our family thinks this recipe is great.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#8#1#This is an amazing recipe. You cannot imagine the flavor this combination of ingredients produces. I have served it at a couple get togethers and it is the first thing gone.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#20#Sorry, TOH, but these were not very good. I love horseradish, but it does not belong in these sliders! The brown sugar also does not belong with horseradish.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#8#4#This recipe was so good. The sauce that you pour over the sandwiches is amazing. I had to tweak it a little bit for picky people in my house - didn't use horshradish and substituted spicy brown mustard and used dijon. This was delicious! I was in a crunch for time to make these so I put them in at 350 for 20 minutes. They were perfect!!! Definitely would make these for a family get-together. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#4#1#Crazy good. Double the recipe so you have lots though!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#3#0#Family enjoys these tasty sandwiches! Only change for us it to use less Horseradish. it was a little too strong for our taste. We use this when the family come often.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#3#13#The horseradish was not a great compliment to these sandwiches. At all !! All the 5 star ratings fooled me. The horseradish taste like how it sound. It has a very strong taste and is spicy. I would make this again with all the other ingredients. I highly recommend finding an alternative to the horseradish.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#3#3#YUM! I made these on a whim for my husband and myself. I like that you can't mess this up and soooo tasty. My husband preferred his hot and would nuke his for about 30 seconds on high. Good hot or cold. I used a large serrated knife to cut through and had no problems. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#6#3#My girls rated this recipe the best! I have made many versions of these over the past year and my daughter said these were the best she's had yet. I followed Gail's suggestions (review from April 8, 2020) and broke the buns apart and topped each one with Ham and Cheese. It was a little more time consuming but well worth it. This one's going in the Recipe Box:) 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#24#3#My family loves these! I always make a double batch for parties and potlucks. One batch just as the recipe says. The other batch I skip the horseradish and put a tiny smear of apricot, peach or marmalade jam on the bottom bun. Leave out the onion in the butter sauce topper and use sesame seeds to differentiate between the two versions. Both are huge hits! Be sure to cut the ham and cheese to roll size before you put them together as it mskes them so much easier to cut for serving after they're baked. Some vidros on the internet call for jyst laying large whole slices of ham overlapping on the bottom buns. But then there's a huge mess when you try to cut them apart after baking. Avoid it by having the ham and cheese fit on the individual buns to start with! 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#8#0#I made these for the 1st time a couple weeks ago. I didn't have any poppyseeds so left those out and I couldn't find any horseradish spread at my local grocery store so I used just the tiniest pinch of regular prepared horseradish on the bottom of each bun. I also could only let them sit in the fridge for about an hour before we needed to eat lunch that day. My teenage daughter who is THE pickiest eater on planet Earth loved them. Tomorrow night I am making a double batch of the sauce and pouring it over baked chicken breasts for a quick and easy dinner. I'm also planning on making the sauce and pouring it over plain Hawaiian rolls and baking them at Easter for a quick and easy and DIFFERENT side for Easter dinner! The sauce is the Boss lol! Soooooo tasty!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#4#4#This are always a hit! I just skip the horseradish.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#3#3#I used Regular dinner rolls, as I do not like really sweet bread, and I only used 6 but left the rest of the recipe as is. It came out really well and we enjoyed it.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#8#4#The recipe does not call for 18 rolls but 18 oz. The 12 roll package is 18 oz. I use 1 T. each of brown sugar, honey dijon mustard, and poppyseeds. 1 t. Worchestershire. No onion or horseradish sauce. Covered with foil 10 min., uncover, bake 12 min. more. Can make right away.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#3#8#Delicious, but note: The video shows 12 rolls in a square pan, not a 13x9 inch pan. The printed recipe says it makes 12 rolls, but it calls for an 18 oz package of rolls, an 18 ounce package of rolls has 18 rolls. So, it looks like the video is showing a 12 oz package of rolls, with 12 rolls in a square pan, but the printed recipe calls for 18 rolls, but says it makes 12. SO, wondering if this can be fixed. I did make 18 rolls, and I did 1 1/2 times the other ingredients. Regardless, this is good!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#3#0#Delicious dish made it for bridge club. Another way to make these with with a poppyseed dressing. Always a hit!!!!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#5#1#I left the horseradish sauce off, but did the rest exactly as written. I took it to a church function, and it was a hit. Everyone wanted my recipe.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#2#0#My cousin Jessie has made these for our family on so many occasions and they are always a hit and never any left overs. Delicious, easy, and sure to impress your guests! LOVE LOVE LOVE them!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#4#5#I'll be the first to admit that I have a sweet tooth, I've never met a candy I haven't liked. But this meal was too sweet. If the Brown sugar was omitted, that would cut back on the sweetness. I'd definitely make it again without the brown sugar.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#What other meat would work for these,they look so good. My daughter is allergic to Ham. thanks
Ham and Swiss Sliders#2#0#I have made these often for potlucks at work and often get asked for the recipe. I usually put a tiny bit more ham on each bun, and tend to go lighter on the horseradish so it doesn't overpower everything. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#1#I made these for another family and didn't get the opportunity to taste them myself. My rating is based on their report of the sandwiches being very good . 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#10#2#I do not prefer horseradish sauce at all. Anyone have any suggestions for what to use instead? Garlic butter, maybe? Honey mustard?
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#These sandwiches are the BEST. Only problem is you need to plan ahead since the sandwiches need to refrigerate for several hours before baking. However just a small inconvenience .
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#We had these at church at a luncheon and they were a huge hit
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#These are SO DELICIOUS!! I don't care for horseradish so I skip that part but otherwise I keep it the same. I made it for our Christmas Eve buffet and it was a real hit. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#I made these for a recent finger foods potluck and they were delicious. They are very easy to make. I used creamy horseradish and that and the slightly sweet topping really made them something special.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#Easy and delicious!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#1#Made these for the family and they were gone in no time! I added a little mayo to the horseradish sauce and omitted the poppy seeds because I was out of them. The glaze was yummy and really made the sliders. Refrigerated them in the morning and baked them later that day. This is great party fare - will definitely make again!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#Made for a family reunion and everyone raved. Gone in no time, and everyone wanted the recipe. Will make again and again.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#Soft, creamy texture. Tasty. This recipe is very satisfying.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#Very easy to make. Didn't change a thing! My family lived it! Could see it being a great party food. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#Served at a gathering and they disappeared. Didn't change a thing. This recipe is definitely a keeper. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#I made these sliders for lunch today and they were a big hit -- the dressing/topping brings out the flavor of the ham and cheese. I will be making these again!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#We started serving this at funeral dinners at Church , now I make them for potluck dinners at Church and there's never anything left. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#3#0#Wonderful recipe! The technique is the secret. Leave out items you don't have on hand or you know you don't like or sub with something similar. The recipe still produces a great dish! 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#2#0#Wow!! These savory sandwich rolls are true winners! I made it according to the recipe with no changes. I served it with a salad and deviled eggs to a group of women for lunch. Raves abounded! I love the fact that it is made the night before, refrigerated, and ready to pop in the oven right before serving. All guests requested the recipe. Thank you, Iris, for making me look like a culinary star!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#1#I did not change a thing. These were super yummy, a nice way to turn a simple sandwich into a meal. I really liked how the bottoms of the sandwiches got nice & crispy while the tops were soft & pillowy. The sauce was hard to pour so that each sandwich got a similar amount of stuff, but in the end after baking, it all evened out in the pan. I put them in the fridge for a good part of the day & not overnight & they were fine. Make the sauce first, assemble the sandwiches & pour your sauce. I used Sandwich Pal horseradish sauce & it was perfect. You could eat the onion sauce with a spoon. I will make these again & I might try the Reuben idea too.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#Not a fan of horseradish sauce or swiss cheese. Pepper Jack cheese gave it the right kick for us.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#My family can't get enough of these! Every time I have made them so far, I've left out the horseradish. These are yummy! 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#2#The first time I made it my husband fell in love with it. We had it for lunch and then again for dinner. He said I could make it any time which is great as he is fussy. The only things I did different is I forgot to get the Swiss cheese so used mozzarella and I didn't have any poppy seeds. It is a keeper! 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#1#Help! I made too many....CAN I FREEZE THESE BEFORE I BAKE THEM?
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#Love it just the way it is. My family is very happy when I tell them these are on the menu.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#This is a big hit at work and at my football tailgates. I substitute real ham or ham loaves (sliced thick) in place of the deli ham, and I use horseradish from the jar with regular mustard to spread on the bottom half of the buns.This has to be prepared the day before you serve it, but it's DEFINITELY worth the effort! :-) 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#I made these for the Food Bank volunteers and they loved them.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#This was good, but would have been better without the horse radish. I would try mayo next time.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#1#Made this for the superbowl party. While the flavor is delicious, they were sort of messy to eat. They were't a huge hit, but they were tasty. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#This is an easy and delicious recipe. I did not have Hawaiian buns, so I used regular slider buns. I don't like spicy, so I used Honey Mustard instead of the horseradish sauce. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#1#Every time I try a new recipe I make it exactly as shown. The next time I tweak. With this recipe there is nothing to tweak! It is delicious as is. I made it as a snack at Christmas and everyone loved it! I ate 3 as a snack! Love finding recipes I can keep forever.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#My family loves these! I make up a batch and then freeze them in packages of two. That way we always have them on hand for a quick sandwich. Super good!!!!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#Been making these for YEARS !!! WE have always known them as OVEN SAMMIES !!! Family loves them and nice to have on hand when someone heads out the door so they can grab 1 or 2 ! Hubby likes when I make these and he is doing yard work or other chores comes in for a break and has a couple !
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#These were ok. Couldn't really taste the main ingredients with all the highly flavored condiments and for some reason mine came out very soggy...ick. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#3#6#Ugh! Black forest ham with a good aged swiss cheese should be left to enjoy on your favorite bread. Caramelized everything else over powered the ham and cheese. Too sweet and greasy. High in calories, time-consuming and costly. A very poor use of poppy seeds.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#These are delicious and are often requested at my house.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#2#These have been our go to weekend lunches for years. We use the 24 package of the brown n' serve rolls that come in their own aluminum pan. (it saves cleaning another pan) Make sure you use a sharp bread knife when cutting into individual sammies. These are best cut when they are cold coming out of the fridge. We only add the brown sugar about every 4th time we make them. It is a nice change of pace. So is changing up the mustards; wholegrain, Dijon and hot/sweet, for example. When we use hot/sweet we skip the brown sugar. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#I made this and it was good. I decided that the next time I would put a slice of bread and butter pickle inside on top of the cheese before putting the roll top on. I like that I can make aheadr and the leftovers, if any, are good cold.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#Everyone loves this recipe and I never have any leftover. I've doubled the recipe for potlucks and picnics. I did use dijon mustard instead. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#best for a party
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#I have never been one to like horseradish or mustard. That said, I blended sour cream and added horseradish to taste. The zip of the horseradish is part of what makes these so good! The dressing made to pour over the sandwiches, even with the dijon, rounds these out perfectly. I was SO glad I tried this and the family devours them! The convenience of making them several hours in advance, going to run errands or work in the yard/house, then poppin them in the oven when we get hungry is great too. A keeper of a recipe!!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#2#Since we have toddlers who are picky eaters, I omitted horseradish sauce but used butter instead. The whole family and parents in laws loved it. We have also made this when we have extended family over. The children and teenagers and adults all love this dish.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#Perfect little sliders for any event. Not a fan of the Hawaiian sweet rolls so I used Rhodes frozen small dinner rolls. For us they were perfect. I also cut back on the brown sugar. I also had no Horseradish sauce so used mayonnaise on both the top and bottom of the rolls. I also did not leave them over night in the fridge. Made up early in the morning worked out just fine. This is a wonderful recipe. One that I will frequently make.JanieTaste Of Home Volunteer Field Editor
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#I made these for company & everyone loved them. Only problem was the grocery store sold horseradish but not horseradish sauce. I found a recipe online to make up my own horseradish sauce, since using just horseradish would be too strong.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#2#I had leftover ham from Sunday dinner, so I decided to try these. Everyone really enjoyed these sandwiches. Make sure to use horseradish sauce, or the horseradish may be over powering. The grocery store near my home sells Hawaiian mini sub rolls (about the size of two regular rolls), so I used these. I didn't have poppyseed so I used deli mustard which had seeds. I also used one and half tablespoons of mustard and brown sugar. I stuck the sandwiches in the freezer for an hour before baking because I didn't realize they needed to be refrigerated for several hours until I started making dinner. Turned out wonderful. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#Awesome dish! These were a hit! Amazing flavor punch! My boyfriend and I almost ate the whole pan in one sitting! Will be added to the rotation!!!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#These are to-die-for! I make them all the time. Everyone loves them. What a great breakfast dish.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#All I could taste was horseradish. I followed the directions to the letter. I might try again without the horseradish because they smelled so good otherwise and I think they could be without it.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#I have made these several times and each time they turned out great! Everyone just loves them. These will become my go to recipe for any potluck!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#These buns are absolutely the best, so easy to put together and a carefree oven dish. This would make a great potluck addition or appetizer or even lunch meal. I'll be pulling these out of the oven often. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#These sandwiches were a hit at our family gathering. The buns ended up a bit soggy though. I will try again.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#1#Delicious! I love that you can make these ahead and then just pop them in the oven when you're ready. I personally think, between the caramelized onions and the king bread, that adding the brown sugar makes it all too sweet and I will try it without the added sugar next time - perhaps with some sauteed onions and peppers, hmmm.... 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#I have made this a few times, each with excellent results. Husband really enjoys this recipe! The horseradish sauce gives it an extra zip. Fantastic dish for get togethers!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#I made these twice over the past year and just love them. So easy to prep ahead. I don't seem to use a full 1/2 cup of horseradish sauce but they still have a kick. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#Took this to two different get-togethers within one week and had a total of nine requests for the recipe. Moist and flavorful. It's so easy to prepare and Just love that it can be fixed one night and baked/served the next. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#Awesome recipe. I took these to a golf potluck and everyone raved about them. Several requests for the recipe.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#1#Amazingly easy recipe that tastes like you spent a lot of time on it! I was not sure of the combination of flavors, but they turned out to be surprisingly delicious! Easily adaptable to a wide range of fillings. A definite hit at the dinner table, I'd make them for breakfast as well. A real winner! 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#absolutely delicious!! and you dobt have to chill in the fridge you can assemble and pop in the oven
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#1#I haven't made this exact recipe but I'm still giving it a thumbs up......I got this recipe from a friend and it wasn't exactly the same ---no caramelized onions or horseradish or w'shire sauce, maybe she didn't like those things so left them out. I don't think you can mess up this recipe ! I used regular h'burger buns, mustard powder, no poppy seeds (didn't have any ) . I made them in a 9x13 pan. The men thought they were alittle sweet, but still devoured them ! my g'kids just loved them and keep asking me to make them again ! This recipe is really pretty forgiving and versatile, for me it's a keeper. Now I want to try this version......Oh also they freezer great..... 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#3#Made these for Sunday breakfast and I was disappointed that they needed to chill once assembled, my fault, so we saved these for Monday morning. I like the fact that you take them from ther refrigerator and pop them into the oven.I thought the sauce was a bit too sweet, kinda like the sweet ketchup sauce one would would put on a meatloaf. All the flavors came through wonderfully. Next time I will cut the sugar to 1 Tablespoon and carmalize the onions prior to adding other ingredients. A keeper recipe for a quick, flavorful breakfast if you plan ahead,
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#I made these with turkey & American cheese and fed some hungry athletes while we were on the road. They were a big hit. Now I'm making them again for my family. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#1#These were AMAZING!!!! This is going to be regular for sure. I loved how quick and easy this was to put together. I paired it with a whole wheat pasta salad for a complete dinner meal. I did not use the poppy seeds or mustard because I didn't have them on hand. But they still turned out great! 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#suuuuuuuuuper yummy!!!!!!!!!!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#yes, I tried this recipe and served for Christmas morning. It was excellent and even made great leftovers, heated up in a low oven in aluminum foil
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#Loved this recipe! We will be enjoying this one again! The horseradish added a nice little tang to the sweetness.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#I made these for my co-workers for our Christmas spread. So easy to assemble the night before & then bake at work in our mini kitchen. Everyone raved about how good they were. This recipe will be a keeper!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#This were amazing ! Used for a Christmas brunch and should have made twice as much !! This will be a go-to recipe.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#1#I made these for breakfast the day after Thanksgiving when we planned to travel early in the morning. Just pop them in the oven for a hot breakfast on the go! My family gave them rave reviews, even with the horseradish sauce! I've made them twice since then and used sesame seeds once instead of poppy seeds. They are lovely and versitile as many substitutions can be made with good results. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#I made this for our Christmas get-together and there were none left! I have to admit that I was wondering how the sauce would taste, but I am a firm believer in trying a recipe as it's written before adding my own touches. I wouldn't change a thing - it's absolutely delicious! Thanks for sharing the recipe, Iris! 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#These are so good and a great additon to any get together. My family doesn't care for horseradish sauce, so I usually make them without that ingredient. But whenever I make these, there are never any leftovers. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#Had to try this after seeing them in the magazine and floating around the net. My family was very hesitant to try it because of the mustard in the glaze. I've made it 3 times now, everywhere I go they are gone very quickly. I have been making them by using a 24 ct pack of rolls. I slice the top off, put the bottom half in the 9x13, layer on the toppings and put the top back on. We don't use the horseradish or butter or anything inside of the sandwiches. I use a large knife to cut through everything after they are done cooking. We use 1/4 tsp. Onion Powder because we don't like onions. I've let it sit over night and I've made them an hour after making them. They are best when left to sit over night but still good if made sooner than that as well. I haven't had so many people ask for my recipe in a long time, they are so unique and SO GOOD, YUM! 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#So, so yummy!! Used left-over turkey and Colby-jack cheese. Didn't have any seeds but it was still a delicious meal! Definitely a keeper. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#Great recipe for using up leftover ham. We were in a hurry, so I didn't let them sit, plus I used regular large hamburger rolls and they still got (unsolicited!) compliments from my family. Next time I might try planning ahead and let them sit overnight. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#I made these Christmas Day and they were a big hit. I reduced the horsehadish to 1/4 cup. There was no way I could fit 12 sandwiches into a 8x8 pan so I made 15 and put into a 9x13 pan and it worked out great. I only added a little additional ingredients for the marinade which turned out perfect!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#Made them this morning husband and I loved them, very feeling and good tasting. Will make again.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#THESE ARE AMAZING!! I made them for our Christmas party this year and our guests raved over them. They will definitely become a standard on our party menu! I doubled the recipe and mistakenly didn't double the sauce, but it made so much, it was a happy accident! I wouldn't have wanted double the amount of sauce. Thank you for a FABULOUS recipe! 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#These are so good. I have people over after evening church services a lot during the year, and these have always been a huge hit. My recipe; however, doesn't call for horseradish which is a good thing since I don't really care for it. ;-) Instead of Swiss cheese, I sometimes use gouda which melts so well. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#These are awesome! Everyone I have served them to loves them. I used Hot Sweet Mustard not the spicy brown mustard. I also, waited on the poppy seeds and sprinkled them on top!
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#These are amazing! My whole family loved them, even my kiddos! will definitely make these again
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#1#These were awesome! I took them to a pot luck and had to sweep in and grab the last one quickly so that I could try it. All the different flavors come together really well. I didn't use quite as much horseradish sauce as suggested and it still packed plenty of punch. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. The sandwiches were surprisingly not messy. This recipe is definitely a keeper. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#Really good and fun to make. For a little neater eating, I added the onion mixture to the inside of the sandwiches, and wrapped them in foil to bake. I have some extras so I froze them before baking and can only assume they'll be just as good when thawed. Thanks for the recipe. 
Ham and Swiss Sliders#0#0#I have been making a similar recipe for years. I like the idea of the Hawaiian rolls along with the horseradish sauce. It puts a nice kick on the recipe. I will make this recipe again.
Ham and Swiss Sliders#1#0#This is a delicious sandwich. Being pressed for time, I did not let the sandwiches sit with the onions on top. I used the large sandwich size Hawaiian buns. I made the caramelized onions (but omitted the poppy seeds) and put them ON the sandwich, on top of the cheese. I wrapped the sandwiches in foil and baked them for 30 minutes. My husband is not a big ham eater and he said these were great; he loved the flavors together. This will be a recipe I'll make again and again. 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#1#0#I have made this twice. I followed the recipe as-written using boneless chicken thighs. My teen and tween sons loved it and wanted seconds. Then, I sent the small amount of left-overs in the school lunch the next day by request. This is on the favorites list.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Made the recipe as defined. It was easy and everyone loved it. The thighs vs. breast is also a money saver.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#3#0#Can you used apple cider vinegar
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#5#1#Followed the recipe exact except I used the pressure cooker on my instapot because I didn't have the time to wait 4-5 hours. Came out fantastic. Was a hit with everyone. A keeper. 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#11#3#A good recipe. I used only 1/3 c. sugar, still a good flavor. I did sear the chicken first, placed the slow cooker on high for an hour then finished on low for only 2 hours. The chicken was so tender.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#6#1#I have made these several times and as long as I don't over cook the chicken ;) , it's delicious. My husband is not as wild about the dish as I am but that's only because he prefers using chicken breasts rather thighs. I serve the sauce over riced cauliflower rather than rice to save carbs and pair that with steamed broccoli for a healthy meal. 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#5#0#Next time a little less sugar and more cornstarch
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#5#1#Was delicious! I followed exactly, but added a few drops of sesame oil. My husband and I really enjoyed.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#5#0#Good recipe! Making homemade versions of store bought items is what I like. This recipe does just that with the teriyaki sauce. Cooking chicken on the stovetop is my preferred method as it gets it browned and caramelized. Otherwise, the recipe was followed as written.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#10#1#Didn't have 3 pounds chicken but made rest of recipe with full amounts used Splenda brand brown sugar with half the sugar instead of white sugar. I am diabetic after chemo and radiation so try to cut sugar when I can! I got a new crock pot and set it for 5 hours time. Had bone in thighs. Keep taking lid off and flipping thighs to keep ladling sauce on top several times during cooking. When I went to remove chicken with two tine fork it fell apart and the bone fell back into pot! Oh my gracious the sauce is good enough to eat by itself lol!! Fantastic recipe. Made baby broccoli florets with sharp cheddar cheese instead of rice It was a great meal. So easy to make!!! Thanks for sharing with us!!!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#2#2#Everyone loved it! Know your crockpot, though. If it runs hot, you will not need 4-5 hours. I cooked it for four, but I will cook it for about three hours next time. I didn't move the chicken to a platter. I kept it in the crockpot and threw in a bag of frozen broccoli while I made the sauce. After the sauce was made, I poured it back over the chicken/broccoli while the rice was cooking. Easy and delicious! 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#3#33#Why not just use teriyaki sauce and chicken? Simple 2 ingredients.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#3#3#Wow!! I just made this and can't stress to you how delicious this was. I adjusted the recipe because I didn't have 3 lbs of chicken. I had less than 2 lbs so I reduced the amount it called for by half. I also didn't use the low sodium soy sauce since I didn't have any on hand. I just used the regular and it tasted fine so I'm not sure why everyone commented on how salty it was. Must try! 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Great! Works well with chicken legs. Used brown sugar rather than white. Sauce did not thicken up as well as expected
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#1#0#We are a garlic family, so this was a great recipe for us. My kids had seconds, so this momma was thrilled. The meat was fork tender and the sauce was a nice mix of sweet and savory (between the sugar and the soy sauce.) Would make again! Plenty for 2 meals this this family of 4.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#My favorite for sure! Easily translates left overs into BBQ sandwiches the next night. Love this!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#3#1#We all loved this recipe; adults and children alike. I've made it twice. The second time with rice vinegar and I thought that was better than cider vinegar. 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#This was super easy for a weeknight meal! The family loved it! I used bone in thighs and cooked it for 8 hours. Will definitely make again! Thanks for sharing!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Super delicious, very tender and tasty! Will definitely make again!!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#8#2#I've made this dish 2-3 times, changing the recipe slightly each time. The first time I followed the recipe exactly; the chicken was over cooked and the sauce seemed bland. The most recent time, I used brown sugar, cooked the chicken less than suggested (about 3 1/2 hours), doubled the cornstarch/water and it was the best attempt yet. Simple and tasty!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#1#0#This is a favorite recipe of ours. I halved the recipe and it fit nicely in my slow cooker. I set it for 4 hours but 3 or 3 1/2 hours is sufficient. Definitely a 5 star recipe.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Very good moist meal.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#My hubby hates Chinese food, which he considers dishes like this. But he really loved the flavor the chicken had and we ate up all the leftovers!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#I followed this recipe just as it says and my whole family loved it!!! Thanks so much for sharing
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#2#I used brown sugar and reduced it to 1/2 cup based on other people's reviews. I used frozen thighs, and they took 4.5 hours to cook. I have a baked chicken recipe that I like better and will use in the future. 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Super Easy
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#3#1#My very picky family is already asking when I will make this again. I did tweak the recipe, in part because of personal preference but also because I used what I had on hand. I used about 4lbs of boneless skinless thighs. Following the advice of other reviewers, I used brown sugar instead of white. I also added honey and grated some ginger into the mixture. I substituted rice vinegar for apple cider vinegar and cooked on low in the crockpot for just under 3 hours. Also, I found that I needed to double the cornstarch mixture at the end to get a good thickness. Served over quinoa and steamed broccoli and it was a big hit.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#4-5 hrs was way to long. But I knew that and cooked for 2 hrs and 15 min. Like many I used brown sugar and added a couple more pieces of garlic. It turned out really well but as written it would have been like eating shoe leather. Most crock-pots heat differently so pull out a piece at 2 hrs and see if the internal temp is reaching 160 degrees. if so, they are ready to eat.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#1#I had some left over fresh pineapple, green pepper so added it to the chicken poured the sause and let it cook in the slow cooker. Tasted great but will use brown sugar next time as the white is a little to sweet.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#1#2#This recipe has potential but some flaws that keep it from being 5 stars. First as for taste, it is good but for my family possibly too sweet. For clarity, I did take the advice of other reviewers and use light brown sugar instead of white which I think is essential if you want a true teriyaki flavor. However, the sugar definitely needs to be adjusted and cut down. Second, I also had the same problem as other reviewers in not being able to get the sauce to properly thicken as expected. There was just too much of if and I used a little over three pounds of chicken thighs. I served it with rice and there was PLENTY of sauce to go round and then some! Finally, the cook time is way off. Luckily I had read the reviews and noted this issue. My chicken was done at 3 hours so I moved the crock-pot setting over to warm. If you cook this the full time stated in the recipe you will get over-done dry chicken. As I mentioned, this recipe as potential but could use some tweaking.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#2#0#Delicious! I didn't use my crockpot because it over cooks the chicken. I browned the chicken in a little olive oil, then I drained the grease and cooked the chicken in the sauce until done. Then I put the chicken on a plate and added the cornstarch/water mixture to the pan and heated until thick. Then added the chicken back to the pan. Chicken was tender and not over cooked. 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#This was very good. I cooked on low for 2 1/2 hours - 3 hours and it came out very moist. Also used brown sugar and served with rice and broccoli. The sauce was perfect.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#One of my go-to recipes. Easy to prepare and so good on rice. I can never quite get the cornstarch exactly right to thicken the sauce, so I end up adding more than the recipe calls for to get it thick enough. Really just wind up eyeballing it.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#1#Made this tonight and my husband and I really liked it. Our two year old daughter even ate the chicken, and she tends to be picky about meat. On the suggestion of some I used brown sugar and liked the way it tasted. I'm not wild about Asian dishes but I would recommend this to anyone. 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Very good! Family enjoyed it but suggest just a tad of heat added and only cook for 3 hours. thanks!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#1#This is an excellent recipe! I read about a few people ending up with dry chicken, so I cooked 2 1/2 pounds of chicken breast on low for 2 hours. The chicken came out perfect! Also, when I was making the sauce at the end I added 3 tablespoons of brown sugar and increased the corn starch to make the sauce thicker. So good!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#1#2#sorry but I gotta agree with Kristal/Crystalsounded good/liked most reviews/love teriyaki sauce...BUT......this was awful, I'm sorry but very dry over cooked chicken, sweet yes and altho I do love salt, even too much for me.really appreciate you submitting the recipe, honestly, because I made it liking the looks of it, but just didn't work 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Excellent! I used brown sugar instead of white, upped the garlic to two cloves and the ginger to one teaspoon, and added 1/4 cup chopped shallots. I servd it over brown rice and my family loved it! A definite keeper!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#My dh loved this. I did too, but I think 5 hours was too long or where I bought the thighs. I used brown sugar, and after tasting the sauce I thought it missed some brightness. I had an orange that I'm using in a marinade later in the week, so I grated the rind into it. Glad I did. It really made a subtle difference 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Very tasty, and easy. Love it with steamed rice and broccoli
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#1#Oh my goodness!! This is the best teriyaki style recipe I have ever made! It's easy and versatile! Sometimes I add sliced water chestnuts during the last 1/2 hour of cooking and garnish with thinly sliced green onion! Just delicious! Made this again (about 3 weeks after this 1st review) and used country style spareribs instead of chicken thighs. It was amazing!! Love this recipe! 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Amazing! The last 10 minutes of cooking time, I transferred thighs to a 450 degree oven. Delectable!!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Delicious!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#So easy to make. Love to serve with rice!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#I used boneless chicken breasts for this. Good taste and easy to make, just don't over cook it like I did. 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#So easy and delicious! My kids ADORED this meal!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Chicken was very good. Easy to prepare.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Tasty , easy to prepare . I added some stir fried celery, onion, bell pepper , and green beans .
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#This was good! Not amazing, but solid.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Got rave reviews.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Made it in 1 hour... Superb recipe... I added water to bring down the salt level because Bragg's soy sauce alternative... And I added a bit of palm oil as well... Thank you for sharing 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#This was so easy to put together! Delicious and great left over! I would definitely do this again!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Delicious!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#this was a very tasty dish , I cooked on the stove top on a low flame for about 1/2 hour or so till chicken was 150 , and turned out great , the sauce is very rich and flavorful
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Delicious and easy, need I say more?
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Very good, we especially liked the sauce.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#I'm glad I found this recipe!! I was about to prepare a typical soy sauce based asian thigh recipe but was out of soy sauce. In a quick search I found this and had all the called for ingredients. The only addition my family made was some added Chinese hot sauce to their's to kick up the heat. Great dish. 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Loved it. Made 1/3 in small crock and it worked great. Not sure where the complaint with salt was because it was definitely not salty.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#My husband and I cut this down to only making a 1/3 of this recipe which worked out really nice for the two of us and fit in our 1.5 quart slow cooker. This recipe goes really well with fried whole grain brown rice.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#My entire family loved this chicken!!! I served it with rice & steamed veggies.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#We loved the taste!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#This is one of the few things my family of 5 all like to eat for dinner. I only use about 6 thighs. I subbed pineapple juice for the cider and just use garlic powder (picky kids). When I transfer sauce to skillet I add frozen broccoli with the corn starch, heat then add the chicken and serve over rice. My kids devour the broccoli in this yummy sauce. Thank you for sharing recipe, we have this at least 3 times a month. God bless:)
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#This is a great recipe, and the slow cooker made the thighs extremely tender. Cook up some rice and snow peas, and you have a great, easy to prepare meal!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#YUMMY! Because I am such a lazy cook, I didn't even bother with the cornstarch & cold water business. I hate to have another pan to wash. Such a super recipe!~ Theresa 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#I didn't like the sauce. I might try it again using brown sugar. 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#This was wonderful! I used low sodium soy sauce and it was still good. Will definately make this again.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#THIS WAS FABULOUS!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#This was amazing. Simple, cheap...My husband was away on business, but he loves thighs so I can't wait to make this for him. This tasted just like my favorite fast food Chinese restaurant. 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Very good. I didn't use ginger because I don't like the taste of ginger and I used 1/4 tsp of garlic powder because I didn't have minced garlic. The family really liked it. 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Have a very picky family, and this one is definitely a hit. We all love the sauce: absolutely agree with the low-sodium soy recommendation. Have made it several times with chicken thighs - has anyone tried it with pork chops? Seems like it would work well...maybe with noodles and broccoli?
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Easy, and slow cooked chicken ever!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Easy recipe but needs some help. I will try using brown sugar and adding more ginger. Chicken was a bit dry.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#After reading the amazing reviews, I decided to make it and it was disgusting. I know none of my ingredients weren't spoiled or anything. I always cook, but nobody in the house liked it not even the Inlaws and they eat almost anything :/ 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#very good, i did make a couple of changes but not in the ingredients only in preparation. i cut up the thighs and poured the sauce over the pieces and baked them. there was !
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#This was really good I made for a dear friend and she still raves about it.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Big hit in the house!!!! and super easy! I have made it with bone-in and boneless chicken theighs! Both AMAZING!!!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#I found this recipe a couple of months ago and have made it 3 times already. It's delicious! I definitely recommend that you use low sodium soy sauce. Also, I used both chicken thighs and breasts, but found that the breasts turned out too dry. Served this with steamed broccoli mixed in right before serving. 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Very easy to prepare and the sauce cooks up thick and rich. Will try this with chicken flavored rice.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Used chicken wings and only cooked 3 hours. My 6yr old gave it a 100 + 100!! Hubby said it was a keeper. Had tons of sauce left over and used it in a stir-fry the next day! The other two like it as a dipping sauce for chicken nuggets!!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#After eating a lot of dry chicken in college, I was done with chicken. Every once in a while I would try a chicken dish and NO I did not like chicken. But, 5 years after college I gave this recipe a try and LOVED it. SOOOOO GOOD! I forgot I was eating chicken. :)
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#this was great, I don t care for salt but I used low sodium soy sauce and it was fine will definitly make it again 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#This recipe needs fruit to add to taste and eye appeal.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#I don't often use my slow cooker but I was eager to try this recipe. I'm glad I did as it was delicious! I used low-sodium soy sauce and did not find it too salty. I am making it again today and I'm certain it will be a staple in our household. 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Really Liked it! Very Tasty. I used two chicken breasts, and two chicken thighs.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Too salty for us - but I'd love to find a similar recipe with less salt! 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#I made this tonight and it was excellent! I used 2 chicken breasts and 6 boneless skinless thighs. The only thing I had to do was increase the cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce but that is no big thing. It was super good and I'm sure we'll make it again soon! 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Tasty is how my husband described this dish and my picky eater daughter said very good. I used chicken breasts in this recipe. Very good and easy. The sauce was excellent.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Great recipe, would certainly make again.Very tasty!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Way too much salt.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Great recipe, can't wait to make it again. 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Very tasty!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#I didn't use the ginger because we didnt have any and it was still amazing. I used chicken breasts and was worried it tasted too plain. But once I made the sauce I was in love. Best sauce ever 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Great recipe! I did use boneless skinless breasts and browned the chicken in a skillet before putting it in the slow cooker. My sauce came out a little too runny and needed a little extra cornstarch.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#this is amazing a family favorite!!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#This is amazing one of my family's favorites! I highly recommend it! 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#I did this yesterday for my first dinner party with church friends and it was awesome! Used light brown sugar instead and served with 1-minute brown & wild rice & wilted spinach.Not a bite was left!!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Wonderful. I made a change- I only had 1/4 c of soy sauce and I used 1/4 c of teriyaki along with it. I only used 4 T vinegar. This was great. I would use broccoli florets next time.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#OMGOSH! Absolutely WONDERFUL! ALL of my men raved about how good supper was. I dont normally double or triple recipes I havent made before but i doubled this one and Im thankful I did. Will be making triple batches from now on just to make sure there is enough for all my hungry men and a bit leftover for mom for lunch. May end up making a second crockpot full just for the teriyaki sauce to use for other things like pork chops. May add a bit of sesame seeds (toasted ?) next time, my crew loves them.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#I put a little of the teriyaki sauce in a skillet and glazed the chicken right before I served it. we love this recipe!!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#My family devoured this chicken. The sauce is excellent and goes great over rice. I could not find boneless skinless chicken thighs at the grocery store so I used bone-in chicken thighs that I took the skin off of. I tried boneless skinless chicken breasts once but have to say the bone-in thighs gave it more flavor. However, both are good.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#I made this and it is amazing! The sauce is the best! Served w/fried rice. I used 1 TB minced garlic and ginger instead of powdered. Thanks for sharing.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#I really liked the flavor of this recipe! And the convenience of a slow cooker recipe. I made it with boneless skinless chicken breasts.
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#I made this for my teenager and his friends, and it was a big hit (with them and my husband and me)! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of the thighs. At the end, I covered a broiler pan with non-stick foil, laid the cooked chicken on it, brushed tops of chicken with thickened teriyaki sauce, broiled for 2-3 minutes; then flipped chicken and repeated for other side. Served with rice and passed the sauce--YUMMY! I made a little extra sauce because I cooked a little more than 3 lbs. of chicken (using a 5 qt. slow cooker). It didn't go to waste. My son used it over the next few days with leftovers and with other things he made for himself. It's very good teriyaki sauce. I served this dish with honey sauteed broccoli and carrots, which was a delightful complement. I will definitely make this dish again. I love finding tasty, easy recipes for the slow cooker! 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#I already reviewed this recipe but I have to rave about it again. I make this dish often because my family goes nuts over it. I always make broccoli separately to add to the dishes of those who will eat vegetables and I also pour the sauce into a saucepan and then triple it because they love lots of extra sauce. This is a fabulous recipe!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#I didn't actually make this exact recipe, but I DID make the sauce part of it - I never seem to have a bottle of teriyaki sauce on hand, and I was desperate for some last night for an Asian beef and broccoli dish I was making, so I was very happy to come across this recipe so quickly in the 2010 cookbook that I recently got in the mail. My family devoured it!! The chicken looks delicious so I'll be putting it on the menu very soon! 
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Delicious dish! The whole family loved it. The first time I made it I forgot to thicken the sauce and it was still wonderful. Will absolutely make again!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#This dish was so easy and my whole family loved it. I served it over rice and cooked veggies and it was a big hit!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#Excellent, super easy dish! I had a busy day and just tossed it all in the crock pot and voila-what a great dish! I will never buy store bought teriyaki sauce again!
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#This is the best chicken dish I've ever made in the slow cooker.I used large chunks of boneless chicken breast and added pinneapple chunks and green pepper at the end of cooking to make it a one dish meal.. I also substituted Splenda for all the sugar.  
Teriyaki Chicken Thighs#0#0#very good, easy 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#2#0#Thank u for this fast, easy, delicious recipe. ?? I just added a lil vanilla.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#7#7#OMG!! Saw this and it sounded like what my mom made when I was young. Just made it, with a few tweaks, and it was exactly like she made, awesome! Added splash of vanilla and used half regular peanut butter and half Peter Pan honey roast. Also used 1/4 cup less sugar and put the butter in with the sugar and milk. Great taste!!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#2#1#Excellent recipe! I would make it again!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#15#3#Oh. My. Goodness! I absolutely love peanut butter fudge, and this recipe is AMAZING!! 10 out of 10 recommend!!!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#13#13#I made some tonight. And when I got it out of the refrigerator to cut it. my bottom was still a little creamy, which I didn't use foil cause I can't stand foil, it makes me cringe.. hopefully by in the morning it will Harden up.. but it tastes really good.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#8#2#This always come out so good! Great gift for neighbors!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#2#3#I've made this fudge numerous times and it always turns out perfect. Just follow the instructions and you will have a pan full of deliciousness to enjoy yourself or share with friends. Makes a great welcome to the neighborhood gift. 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#33#65#While this looks yummy, it's not the Easiest by far. This one is VERY EASY and delicious! 2 C Sugar 1/2 C Milk 1 t Vanilla Extract 3/4 C Peanut Butter Bring sugar
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#1#0#Love it
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#1#1#I can't make fudge the old fashioned way because I can't stir or hold on to the spoon long enough to bring it up to temp needed to set correctly. I now use the Marshmallow Creme to make all my fudges. 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#1#1#This fudge is heaven. It brings back Elementary School Lunch Memories. EVERYONE looked forward to home cooked lunches with homemade fudge for dessert. Yummy! Thank You!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#12#1#Just made this. Just easy an easy best one definitely for a quick an soft fudge!! Negative people cook it your own way then why ya looking if yours is so fantastic!! GOOD RECIPE GIVE IT A TRY??????
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#3#1#This is a fantastic recipe.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#2#1#wonderful!!!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#1#My family thoroughly enjoyed this FUDGE.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#5#1#This is a favorite in our house and easy to make. I add melted chocolate across the top for an added kick.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#3#0#Super, easy, super creamy and so delicious. Makes terrific Instant Gifts. It also freezes very well. Nice clean cuts into perfect bite sized squares. I used crunchy Peanut Butter for that extra little Peanut Butter Taste. VFE
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#2#0#Super easy and tasty! Best fudge recipe I've found! 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#1#0#Soooo good! Clear, easy recipe, no changes, came out great!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#1#0#This is the easiest recipe ever! Turned out perfectly and I stirred and stirred continuously. That's the key to keeping the mixture from burning. Used real butter to coat the pan to give it a rich buttery taste. Saved and treasured!!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#4#1#When I first discovered this recipe in your magazine years ago, I gave it a try because it sounded so easy... and it was! It was exactly like the peanut butter fudge they used to serve in the school kitchen when I was little. Soooooo good! At Debbie on Nov 3, 2018... The butter is used to grease the pan in step 1. At Susan11160 on Apr 24, 2018... Maybe you should give the recipe a try before giving it such a poor rating. The marshmallow fluff gives the fudge a soft, slightly fluffy texture and is not at all gross. I'm not fond of thick, dense, hard fudge. This definitely is NOT thick and dense or hard... it's nice and soft and fluffy. 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#2#0#This is perfect. My son in law finishes the entire recipe in 2 days every time I make it! So easy too.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#2#0#Omg yum! Super easy! Didn't require a candy thermometer, which I loved! And everyone is absolutely raving about this fudge!!!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#2#0#EASY, FAST & DELICIOUS!!! No changes.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#1#Made just as recipe written. Both my husband and I thought it had a grainy texture. Tasted OK. Probably will not make again. Must admit that it was very easy to make.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#2#0#I tried this from googling peanut butter fudge. It was easy. Creamy and taste heavenly.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#2#0#I have make this recipe for years and love it. Use a flavorful peanut butter for best results.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#3#0#I've tried lots of recipes, this was the first that came close to the one my mother always made . I used crunchy peanut butter and added some vanilla and a pinch of salt. I greased the foil with spray and added the butter to the milk and sugar mixture. So glad this recipe doesn't need a candy thermometer. Prep your ingredients first so you can mix quickly. 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#3#0#I've never made fudge before, and I must admit, after reading some of these flop reviews, I was a little scared. But, this fudge turned out perfect, and my entire family loved it. I will definitely make this again for the holidays! 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#1#Topped with mini marshmallows, salted peanuts & chocolate chips & under the broiler a couple minutes then swirled the topping. Very rich.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Best Fudge recipe! Very fluffy and creamy. We only make at Christmas and my husband helps with the stirring. Yields great results.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#8#0#I have made this many times! It is the best and easiest recipe I've found for peanut butter fudge. I went to get the ingredients today to make more and both stores in my little town were sold out of marshmallow creme. I am wondering if I can make this with whole marshmallows, what adjustments I need to make if so... I'd appreciate any help please! Thanks for the best fudge recipe EVER! 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#1#0#I'd never made fudge before and was scared. This is the best fudge I've ever eaten. Made it many times last fall/winter and getting ready to make it again for the 2nd time in two weeks. Thank you so much. 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#2#0#Made this recipe many times. Went to make it tonight, and didnt have milk. So I used half and half instead. Came out really creamy, and really delicious. Recommend trying it.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#The best peanut butter fudge ever! We never use another recipe. It's like a fluff sandwich on sugar steroids! 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I just whipped up a batch and it turned out perfect...it's chilling now so I don't really know how it's going to cut & taste but the fudge looks smooth, tastes wonderful, super easy...I can't wait to try a piece!! 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#2#0#This turned out perfectly. I read previous reviews before trying this one. The problem with a lot of recipes is lack of details. Have your marshmallow creme jar open, and your peanut butter - I used Jif No Stir Natural Creamy Peanut Butter. already measured out. Prep your pan before you start. I line a 7 x10 glass pan lined with parchment. You must first bring the milk (I used evaporated milk) and sugar to a full boil - one that does not go away when stirred. I usually start with medium-high to get the boil going, then back off to medium once it's boiling. You must stir constantly. Begin your 3 minute timing once the mixture comes to a full boil. Take the pan off the heat! I immediately stirred in a tsp of vanilla. Now you've got to work quickly. Add your peanut butter and marshmallow creme. Stir with a wooden spoon until thoroughly combined. Pour into your prepared pan. Let it cool completely at room temperature. To cut it, just lift it our with the parchment paper and place it on your cutting surface. Cut into 1 squares because it's quite rich. LOVE this recipe! Plenty of peanut butter flavor for me. 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#1#0#This is the best recipe I have tried. My kids love it too! 5 stars ! I used 1/2 marshmallow cream and 1/2 regular marshmallows. My fudge set just fine.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Mine turned out great. If it burns, that means your heat is too high. Try medium heat.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#4#Mine burnt. So disappointed. Followed your directions and it burnt before I could pour it. Will never use this recipe again. What a waste of time and money
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Too sweet for me. Not enough peanut butter taste.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I made this yestter day did not go will i thank i boiled it to long so i made it today and it whent realy good
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#The flavor of this fudge is absolutely delicious! I made the mistake of substituting marshmallows for the marshmallow creme, so unfortunately the fudge did not set. That's okay though, as we will now use this delicious confection as peanut butter topping for ice cream! 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#1#0#It's the easiest fudge recipe I've ever found that produced such delicious results! I get requests from friends and family for this amazing fudge. I typically make it the night before and allow it to set overnight, then I cut it with a greased pizza cutter. I'm not sure about it yielding 3-4 dozen, unless you cut the pieces very, very small. I would say more like 2 1/2 dozen would be more accurate. 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Is delicious and easy to make. Be careful, though, if you're addicted to sweets...this is so good you might eat the whole pan of fudge yourself. 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#1#0#This was quick and easy and good! You have to start the timing when it begins to boil though.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#evryone i have made it for loves it :)
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I cooked the sugar and milk 3 minutes and it was too dry after cooling. The taste was OK.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Easy to make and tastes great!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#2#My first attempt at this fudge produced very dry and crumbly fudge. I changed when I started timing my boil time the second time and the fudge was perfect.When you time for the 3 minutes DO NOT start timing at a full boil. I did this the first time and my fudge was very dry and crumbly.Start timing for your 3 minutes as soon as it starts to boil. I removed from heat after the 3 minutes of boil before I added the marshmallow fluff and peanut butter.I only had a 13 oz jar of fluff and measuring out 7 oz was a pain. I highly suggest buying the 7 oz jar if possible.Good luck!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#This was my first time making peanut butter fudge. This recipe was sooooo easy! I couldn't believe it. Thanks for sharing!!! 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#This is and has been my go to PB fudge recipe. Asked my granddaughter's boyfriend for a suggestion for a Christmas gift and he immediately asked for a batch of my PB fudge!! Nuff said. 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I made this for the first time today was a big hit with everyone will be using this recipe from now on even my 9 yr old granddaughter made a batch and it turned out perfect
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#yummy
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Absolutely the easiest recipe I have in my book. Everyone raves about this fudge, every year it is on the Christmas Cookie tray!!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#3#I tried this for the first time and will not try again. As soon as the sugar and milk started a rolling boil, I timed 3 minutes exactly and by the time I got the marshmellow cream in the pan, the peanut butter was so hard and had to be scraped from pan.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I have been using this recipe to make traditional peanut butter fudge. Friends and family love my peanut butter fudge so much, I tell them the recipe is a secret. Extremely good!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Accidentally said I wouldn't make it again. I would. Daily. 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Oh, my goodness! This is the best peanut butter fudge I've ever eaten. So delicious, so creamy, I want to marry it.

Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#simple and never failed me - delicious!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I was given fudge made with this recipe as a birthday gift and immediately asked for the recipe. Makes an excellent center for Buckeye Candy!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I made this receipe with soy milk and it came out perfect. My husband and children didn't notice the difference. I made sure my the sugar and milk reached 232 degrees with my candy thermometer. Our family will definately make this fudge again. 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Great recipe! Very easy and delicious, the only way this would turn out dry or gooey is if you dont set your timer. Once it comes to a full rolling boil set your timer.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#1#Gooey gummy, never sat up, even tried the freezer. I might re-heat and try as n ice cream topping.Waste of time and $$$$
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#1#This fudge was dry!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Excellent fudge, my whole family loved it, nice and creamy.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#This is THE best peanut butter fudge recipe I have ever tried! Melts in your mouth, very delicious!!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#This has become a Christmas time staple for my family!! It is amazing!!! I have made it with both chunky and creamy peanut butter, both are excellent!!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#1#0#I got a Taste of Home Quick Cooking magazine probably in 1998. It had this recipe in it and I loved it. It is extremely easy to make and the taste is fantastic. I lost the magazine and am so glad that I was able to get this recipe again. I am positive that everyone that tries it will absolutely love it.Thank you,Carolyn Oliver
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#1#0#this recipe is one of my favorite peanut butter fudge recipes! itand#39;s so easy, and very delicious!!! 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I made the recipe so many times during the Christmas season. It's so easy to make and truly delicious, plus it uses a cup less sugar than my old recipe and no butter! Be careful not to over cook as it does set really quick!This recipe is a keeper! 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#This is great peanut butter fudge !To the reviewer who had problems with the fudge setting up, you should cook the sugar & milk over medium heat until it becomes to a hard boil & then time it for 3 minutes. If you cook it on high heat, it doesn't cook long enough & therefore it doesn't set up very well. I used to do that & mine never set up. Hope this helps. :) 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Sooooo yummy! I get a lot of compliments on this one. My husband said it's the creamiest peanut butter fudge he's ever had. 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#easy to make and tastes wonderful...I did not have marshmellow creme and used marshmellows instead, turned out great!!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#This is my never fail fudge. Because it is timed it is always yummy and perfect!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#This is the best peanut butter fudge I've ever had! I have been making it for several years now since my 14 year-old was in the 3rd grade. His teacher at the time still talks about how great it is and she now makes it for all her co-workers at Christmas. I am getting ready to make it right now! For those who have had problems with it setting up, the only time that ever happened to me was the first time I made it-I didn't cook it for the full 3 minutes. Make sure you time it or it will not set up. Don't give up, though, just try it again and it will be perfect!! 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Unfortunately, my fudge never set-up. I left it in the fridge for several hours. I even tried the freezer for a little while but it didn't help. It tastes good but I can't give it to anyone else. 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I HAVE MADE THIS FUDGE ABOUT 4 TIMES NOW IN THE LAST MONTH,EVERYBODY WANTS THIS RECIPE,THIS WILL DEFINATELY BE THE DESSERT THAT I MAKE FOR THE FAMILY HOLIDAY DINNERS...THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE BEST PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE IN THE WORLD. AND SO EASY TO MAKE. I'M GOING TO MAKE SOME RIGHT NOW. : ) 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I make this fudge a lot and sometimes I will add a small mashed banana
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I have been making this fudge for several years. Always comes out great. I use a slightly larger pan because I prefer smaller pieces. I make this with skim milk, as that is what we drink.No change in texture to me.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Has anyone tried this with fat free milk and reduced fat peanut butter?
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#This was so easy and so smooth, the best yet!!!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#This made a perfect Christmas gift for my family. I did add the vanilla and used part evaporated milk part 2% milk. Thanks for sharing.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Not sure what I did wrong, the fudge didn't set up. It taste great. anyone with ideas on how to salvage this? 
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Yummy! And so easy to make!
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I followed the recipe except i boiled for 4 min and added vanilla. It turned out perfect. I will definately make it again. It is a winner here in my home.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Nice texture, not too sweet ~ perfection! I used evaporated milk.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#I absolutely love this recipe. I make it all the time and use it as gifts. Everyone who eats it loves it. I will never make another peanut butter fudge again.
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#Why can I not print the recipe & the nutrition facts together on your recipes? When I highlight to copy it I can print only the right side or the left side with select print. Help. S W
Easy Peanut Butter Fudge#0#0#This is another one that's going in my recipe box. Yum! 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#7#2#This dish was delicious and one I will make again and again! I used cherry tomatoes as that's what's in our garden.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#9#5#After chopping and laying out the ingredients, my first step was to whisk the mayonnaise, vinegar, salt, and pepper. My second step was to add the tomato, celery, and green onions to the dressing and blend it well to integrate the flavors into the dressing. Then I continued on with the rest of the recipe. It was delicious.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#0#This is a great recipe. I made if for my husband and he loved it.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#9#2#Great recipe. I used cherry tomatoes as that's what the garden is overflowing with! I can only hope cooks reach a point of reading a recipe and assessing if the types of seasonings or quantity of seasonings suits their tastes. And then decide how or if you wish to make said recipe. We enjoyed this with additional fresh ground black pepper. Thank you
Bacon Macaroni Salad#2#1#My go to macaroni salad!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#2#33#There is something wrong in this recipe. No way would this be 12 servings of 3/4 cup each. It's maybe 6 cups total, and that's after I added additional tomato, celery and a little extra pasta. I don't know about you, but my idea of a main dish salad like this, with a pound of bacon in it, would be more than 3/4 cup - so please investigate and fix this. Otherwise this had good flavor. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Just
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#0#Just tried this salad and it is a keeper!! Husband commented at least 3 times how good it was. I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and it was perfect with some leftover for next day. Husband again told me 3 times how good it is.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#0#I've been making this since it first appeared in a magazine over 10 years ago. We love this simple salad. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#2#0#The family and I thought this salad was delicious! Am already planning on making it again!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#4#0#I can't understand the downers on this recipe. I took it to a large get together an even with doubling of the recipe there was none left and people were asking for more. This recipe is a keeper. I made sure I used Real Mayo. Great salad!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#25#1#Well, I made it and felt like it was just like something my mom or grandma would make. Maybe it is because I too am from Indiana. maybe because both sides of my family in a weird way are Wrights! Maybe that is why I liked it. Too I miss my grandparents and my mom. Probably the taste buds in the mid-west are far different than other regions. If you're concerned about soybean oil then I know there are other mayo's you buy. Or make your mayo from scratch. I find it unfair that someone would call this a loser or anyone's recipe a loser. Just simply state that if it was not for your taste buds instead of insulting someone's recipe. That might have hurt their feelings. I frankly thought when I saw that...I will not dare share any of my families recipes because of how insulting people can be. In this day. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#0#I did not find this to be anything special- a macaroni salad with bacon mixed in. Never got a sense of a BLT due to the high volume of mayo ( should have followed my instincts and dropped that additional 1/4 cup) . Don't regret making but have no intentions of doing so again. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#19#Made as directed, but extremely bland. I should have trusted my instincts and added some frozen green peas and a little shredded cheese, among other things. Not nearly enough salt for anyone's taste. This one is a loser. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#9#Since mayo is loaded with soy oil, I use quite a bit less of it than this recipe calls for. I use about 3/4 cup and mix it with some sour cream. I also use the spices to taste - that's not nearly enough salt and pepper. My mom always added a dash of nutmeg to her potato salad and I do too. It adds just a little different flavor but don't use too much - just a dash or two (maybe equals about 1/8 tsp or so). I know a dash is different for everyone! If I'm feeling lazy or don't have a lot of time, I sometimes add the pre-cooked bacon bits. This is very similar to the kind we grew up with. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#0#I sometimes substitute cooked salad shrimp for the bacon. But bacon or shrimp everyone loves this salad!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I sometimes substitute cooked salad shrimp for the bacon. But bacon or shrimp everyone loves this salad!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#0#I will never buy store bought again. Made for reunion, everyone raved wanting recipe. Made again. My only change was to add more mayo for creaminess, and more salt to liking.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#0#Nothing really wrong with it just not something that we loved....
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#This is our favorite pasta salad to eat. My husband loves it
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Favorite Summer salad. Recipe always requested at Potlucks.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#This gets rave reviews every time I serve this. It's great for potlucks, just be prepared to share recipe. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Family loved it was a giant hit, can't wait to have it again. Was a great new twist for a pasta salad. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#1#I love this recipe. I used Tree colored pasta. Also no bacon used one small can of sliced Black olives. It gave it a meaty taste without all that bacon I am trying to watch my sodium intake. Yum. I love the fact you use a lot less mayonnaise than the traditional macaroni salad recipes
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#for those of you who have made this:do the salt&pepper amounts taste right to you? doesn't seem like enough of either even though bacon is salty 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Going to make it.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#0#I made this tonight for Sunday dinner. I made it according to the recipe and added a bit of garlic powder. It was delicious! Everyone loved it so it'll be one of my favorite recipes for mac salad. ?? ?? 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Sounds good, can't wait to make it! 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#A great base recipe to start with! Made this for Labor Day party and made it again since then. I added a little garlic powder and used champagne vinegar and a little bit of dill pickle juice to zip it up. Best of compliments: a clean bowl!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#What a big hit!! Everyone loved it at our party! Will make it again!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I made this for my husband's birthday barbecue last month. We had a few people over and the bowl was empty at the end of the meal. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I doubled this recipe and only used 2 tsp of vinegar. Used more salt and pepper. Brought it to a large family gathering and everyone loved i! Lots of compliments.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#1#I saw this same salad in the Jewels Food Store Deli. Bought a half pound. Figured out simple ingredients, looked up recipe, found this one. Only difference is they added cheddar cheese, green and red pepper. I added 1/2 cup Cesar dressing, and little grlic powder. YUMMMM.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I added an extra tomato and everyone loved it.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Loved it, loved it, loved it, that's how many times I've made it so far, and will continue, also have many requests for the recipe! Bless your heart Norene. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I just want to add that I make this same dish but add shredded cheddar cheese.....It is a dish everyone loves.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#0#Oh my, oh my! An absolute keeper!!!! I just tweeked it a little by adding garlic powder to the mayo mixture, and toasted, slivered almonds to mix in when adding the bacon crisps, just a little added crunch. Thank you so much for the recipe! Enjoyed by all!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Great recipe-entire family enjoyed. We made as a meal and added some garlic powder and a couple handfuls of fresh spinach as well. Will be a fantastic potluck dish. Thanks for sharing!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#5#I followed this recipe exactly and it was pretty awful. It tasted like mayo with a little bacon flavor thrown in. This is the first time I've made a recipe with this many good reviews that turned out so badly. Beware unless you love eating mayo straight from the jar. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#0#This was really good. Love the bacon. I think it would also be good if made with ranch dressing instead of the mayo mixture.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I'm always looking for new macaroni salad recipes. My family loves pasta but not the classic mustard/mayo based mac salad. This recipe for a HUGE hit with my picky family. The flavors blend together well once you give it time to sit together. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Delicious! Just the two of us and my husband almost ate the whole dish ! He said if he was at a party he'd fill half his plate up with this salad. Very good. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#0#Great salad! Sometimes I add sweet or dill pickle relish or both and some seasoning salt. Also, adding a little milk will thin out the dressing a little.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Very good. If this is the main dish, I would not say that it serves 12. More like 6. I like lots of veggies so I tripled the tomatoes and doubled the celery. Really liked it--maybe I'll triple celery next time too. For the bacon, I used scissors and cut the raw bacon into small pieces and then fried it in a large Dutch oven and stired occasionally. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Made this for 4th of July bbq. after cooking the macaroni I realized it didn't make very much so had to cook up 2 more cups. so if you're bringing this to a party make sure you double the recipe.I added cubed cheddar cheese and a few T. spoons of ranch dressing powder. We thought it was very good. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I made this dish over the weekend for a pool party and it was a hit! The only thing I did different, was that I added a little more mayo than what the recipe called for and I added some Italian dressing to give it extra flavor. This will definitely remain in my recipe file for a delicious summertime salad. Great combination of flavors!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Great salad! I too added some cheddar cheese to it and I absolutely adore the addition of bacon. My husband is not a fan of macaroni salad but he love this one.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Can't say thank you enough! I was so tired of making my standard macaroni salad and gave this one a try. It was a hit. And thanks to those that suggested Miracle Whip. Will try that this weekend! 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#2#0#I love the people here! We don't worry about carbs, fats, etc. We seem to be home cooks with a family to feed & please! Common sense suggestions to make this more flavorful, & realistic serving amounts. I really love you guys because we do home cooking, not the modern-day, always healthy stuff that our families don't enjoy! I've made this salad since it was in TOH in 2002, & it's been a favorite with our family of eight, now up to 13! I, too, add 8oz. of sharp cheddar cheese & any garden produce we have on hand. It changes a little every time I make it, & they always enjoy it! 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#1#Baconholic here so this is a good base recipe because you can take it and go from there. I use 1/2 tsp of fresh coarse ground black pepper instead 1/4 tsp. Also I add 5 leaves of Romaine lettuce, ribs removed, chopped to about the size of a quarter and 1 or 2, depending on the size, diced Hass avocados and a good full cup of grated sharp Cheddar cheese. Also I use the whole pkg of elbow macaroni. The mayo I use is my own home made, from an old Wesson oil recipe for mayo that came out in the 1930s. We love this salad but it certainly does not make 12 servings unless you're the food police. We like having some left over to snack on later. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#This was very good, but do make sure to season the macaroni with salt and pepper. It's just a tad too bland but with some added s&p, good stuff!! 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#1#My family and I loved this salad, but I did doctor it up quite a bit. I decided to follow a few of the other reviewers suggestions. For the dressing I used 1/4 cup of ranch dressing, one cup of mayo, vinegar, & Cajun seasoning. I also poured bacon grease over the noodles. I used the entire 1 lb box of noodles. I had a few items I needed to use up in the fridge, so I added a partial red pepper & green pepper in addition to the veggies listed in the recipe. I put 1/2 cup of Gorgonzola cheese and it was a perfectly flavored salad to go with our BBQ chicken. We added a splash of Italian dressing to the leftovers the next day and at it with grilled flank steak. Yum! Thank you all for your suggestions.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#We thought this was very good, although I don't know how it could possibly serve 12 people! With a pound of bacon, I served it as a main dish, and it served four with no seconds. We do have big appetites though. I added a little Kraft Zesty Italian right before serving because it seemed a little dry. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I added some bacon drippings and made Miracle Whip part of the dressing along with the mayo and yet the flavor was still bland to me. I then doctored it up with more salt and some Cajun seasoning and only then did the salad have presence enough for my family's tastes. I will keep this in my Recipe Box with notes added for the above alterations. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Make this all the time! A favorite!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#1#I can't believe I forgot to rate this one. I have been making this for several years and always get rave reviews. It's definitely a family favorite. I'll sometime use real bacon bits in place of cooked bacon and it comes out just as wonderful. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#0#It is very easy to make and refreshing any time
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I've made this salad at least a dozen times by now. Everyone loves it. I usually use MiracleWhip (which is lower fat than real mayo) and it tastes delicious. I also mix in about 2 T or so of the bacon grease to the salad for more bacon flavor (bacon junkies here!). Great recipe! 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Love this salad, everyone asks for the recipe and no left overs ever. I actually get people complaining because I did not make enough after doubling the recipe. The only thing I do differently is I do not add the celery and pepper.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Fantastic recipe!!!!!!!!!! I rate this as a full five star recipe. It just was not letting me do the star rating part. Furthermore, I have been making this for years and everyone loves it. I actually searched it just to give it a rating. I initially got it from the taste of home magazine. Everyone that tastes it asks for the recipe and I never have left overs. My husband actually asks me to make batch for the house and the bbq so he can have some when he wants a snack later because he knows it will be gone before we get home. I have even have people complain that I did not make enough because it is gone before they can even dish their plate at the bbqs. It is a keeper!!!!!!!!! I did not put celery in it or the pepper. I also let the bacon and veggies sit in sauce for five ten minutes before I pour over the noodles and I think it makes for better flavor.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#My husband and I thought this was a very good salad. We will be making this again!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#1#I loved the ingredients but decided to add a few other veggies. I used green pepper and seeded cucumbers. The dressing in the recipe was not to the family's liking, and I did not use it 9n the salad. I substituted Hidden Valley Buttermilk Ranch Dressing and the kids declared it a success! 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I've made this salad several times. Each time it is a crowd pleaser! 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#YUMMY! My husband loves it. I mad it twice in the last 2 weeks.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#No matter what mac salad recipe I make my husband always rates it ok . This salade he liked and even had seconds! It seemed kind of blah so I added l/2 cup of sweet pickles, we thought it added alot. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#very very good
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I added a little celery seed and used the extra pepper. Love it!!!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Made this with Tinkyada GF noodles very good
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#This is a great recipe. I've made it twice now. The first time just as written. The second time I didn't want to cook bacon (lazy I guess) so I used a package of Real Bacon. Still good.! 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#1#pretty good I made this for church gathering and everyone gobbled it up. I added some extra mayonnaise and it need a little more kick, so extra vinegar too.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#This has become our favorite pasta salad. Everywhere I take it there are rave reviews. It is excellent!~
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#My family loves this salad.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#0#I made this for a party of 50 and had many compliments. If you like a tangy dressing, you'll love this recipe. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I made this for a party of 50 and had many compliments. It easy to make and if you like a tangy dressing, you'll like this!! 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#1#0#I made this recipe for a group of 50 and had many compliments. It's very easy and if you like a tangy dressing, you'll like this!! 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#This was very good I used mustard instead of the vinegar and my husband and I both loved it I would make this again for any family get togethers.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#This is so good. Every time I make it for a potluck, the bowl is empty right away! Love it!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Tjis recipe is different from any other macaroni salad out there. It is really good, and my family loves it
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#We love this salad! It's easy to make and alsoeasy on the wallet. Goes with everything! 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#One of my favorites! Making it again for our Homecoming at church. I always substitute grape tomatoes!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I have made this recipe many times, and it is always a hit. Very easy too.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#My whole family loves this one, and we've doubled and tripled it for potlucks. My 13 year old even makes it because he thinks its super easy. We also like to add chunks of cucumber, very refreshing. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#1#This macaroni salad was ok, but I've had better. Flavor was a bit bland for me. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#There was too much mayonnaise.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I love this recipe! One of my favorite recipes for pasta salad. It's also very easy to make. I get compliments and recipe requests whenever I make it. I use light mayo (not miracle whip) and it does not affect the flavor or texture. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I like this salad. It is especially good with fresh garden tomatoes and really great butcher shop bacon!
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I take this salad to pot lucks often, especially in the summer. It is definitely a crowd pleaser.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Yummy! A great summer side dish or potluck dish. This appeals to many rather than a few.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#This is very good. As I went to write the review, I realized I left out the vinegar when I made this ): Still very good without it! I plan to take this to a church dinner in a few weeks. Fast and simple! 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#This salad is excellent. Everytime I make it I receive compliments and requests for the recipe. Everything is better with bacon !!!!Annette
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#delicious! you must try this recipe. great for a grill out night 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I have been making this recipe for many years now. I have been told that I can't come to summer parties w/o this salad. It is a family favorite & whenever I introduce it to a new group of people, they beg for the recipe. This one's fantastic! 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I took this to a church potluck and didnt get much reaction at all. My husband taste tested it for me before I took it and he said it tasted like macaroni with mayo on it. Neither of us could understand why the name was blt when it tasted nothing like that. We love macaroni salads but this one wasnt the least bit impressive. Had much better.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#Very good! Word of advice - 12 servings = 6 if you have big eaters.
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#I was looking for something different to make as opposed to the usual stand-bys that I do, I found this and made it. I made a double batch and was lucky enough to get a small bowl of it. This will not sit around long at all. It is our new favorite mac salad. 
Bacon Macaroni Salad#0#0#This is my favorite Macaroni Salad, it's so yummy! I use green peppers instead of celery, it's a crowd pleaser! I make it several times during summer time. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#2#0#Great recipe--it does a wonderful job of disguising the healthy ingredients. However, it has WAY too much sugar in it for me. I doubled the recipe to make it the same as my regular pancake recipe--meaning it now calls for 2/3 cup sugar! My normal pancake recipe only has 2 tablespoons of sugar for the same amount of flour/oats. Because we use syrup on our pancakes I don't feel like I need my pancakes to be sweet too--its just added sugar that is unnecessary. So, next time I will reduce the amount of sugar to 2 tablespoons and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Otherwise, it's a delicious recipe. (also they brown quickly due to all the brown sugar in the recipe, just turn down the heat so they cook a little more slowly and you'll be fine) 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#2#0#Only used all purpose flour. Made half the batch as is, then added blueberries to the remainder. Delicious! Will make a double batch next time and freeze them.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#3#0#I made Brown Sugar Oatmeal pancakes this past Saturday morning for overnight guests. I didn't have whole wheat flour, so I used all white flour; I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Everyone loved them!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#8#I found this to be a rather horrible recipe. The pankcakes came out VERY thick. Would not brown correctly, and were quite tasteless. What a waste of good ingredients! ?????
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#0#The kids loved these pancakes. They're fairly hearty, so I feel like they're better at filling them up before school than a regular pancake. I'll definitely make these again! 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#15#Used all King Arthur white flour and left out the oatmeal, they were delicious!!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#1#I've been making these for a long time and they are still a family favorite. Very thick but easily diluted with a spoon of buttermilk. I used to double the recipe and freeze any leftovers between double layers of waxed paper. Served with warm maple syrup! Even reheated these are fantastic! 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#3#2#My pancake aficionado kids loved this recipe and said no more regular pancakes. I added a small scoop of applesauce after reading all the reviews that talked about such thick batter. My batter wasn't thick at all but I also didn't have whole wheat flour and just used all regular gluten free flour. That might have affected the thickness as well. Plus I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon and topped them with blueberries and raspberries. These were really wonderful. Not as heavy as I thought people said in other reviews but definitely filling. Really great recipe and definitely a family pleaser. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#6#0#made this am, are great. next time will drop sugar to 1/4 cup- were not too sweet, but I like to top pancakes with powdered sugar and lingonberries; ie sweetness on top, not in my pancakes. We only have regular oats because we eat oatmeal and reg. tastes better but worked fine-I soaked the oats for 10-15 mins in the buttermilk while I mixed dry ingred. and cooked sausage. had to add another tbl or so of milk after combining all ingred. one note: they don't really bubble to indicate turn now by time they really bubble, too done, so check early on!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#0#We loved these pancakes!!! Light and fluffy!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#2#0#These pancakes are wonderful. The only change I make is I only use 1/4 not packed brown sugar. I also let the batter sit for about 15 minutes and they come out perfect every time. Thanks for the recipe
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#2#0#I started making these for my family a few months ago. My teenage boys love them, and don't want me to ever go back to my previous (also very good) pancake recipe. These stick with you a little longer. One son eats them with peanut butter on them, one with syrup, and the third with applesauce. Sometimes I use jam. My husband likes them with whatever there is to put on them. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These are amazing pancakes! We love them in the fall with warm syrup!! YUMMMM
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Even though I didn't have whole flour on hand they came out amazing. I see many more of these in my future, but not to many they are a heavy pancake. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#0#Good either just made or from freezer.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#0#The best pancakes bar none! I added some Craisins!!! Phenomenal!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#0#I live alone. Made this recipe. Loved it. Much better than pancakes from a box mix. Loved that they told how to freeze. Soon as they cool they will go In freezer for a good quick breakfast on another morning.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Okay, so I should start out by saying that I added a few things to this recipe. I made the recipe as listed, and then I added an extra glug of buttermilk, a capful of each almond and vanilla extract, and a very ripe banana. Also I didn't want to wash my 1/3 cup so I eyeballed the brown sugar. I ended up leaving it in the mixing bowl to soften up the oats for Maybe 5-10 minutes while I started coffee and then threw that batter on a griddle, cooked those puppies up, and inhaled 3 while they were still warm and covered in smashed strawberries and blackberries. The recipe made 9 good-sized pancakes that were soft, fluffy, and tasted a little like banana bread. I'm sold.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Loved these! Used skim milk lemon juice in place of the buttermilk and half of the brown sugar and these still turned out amazing! Hearty and slightly sweet, I cooked half the batch with blueberries and served the other half plain, topped with fresh berries!!! Definitely a new favorite!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#0#The name should have given it away but this makes a sweet pancake. Too sweet for me which I'm pretty sure is the first time I've ever said that! It is tasty though. I cooked on a low heat but the pancakes stuck to the nonstick griddle because of the high amount of sugar. If I made again I would reduce the sugar. On the flip side (see what I did there) you don't need much syrup or jam to top them. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#I liked these, but mine came out kind of dry. Made the recipe exactly, except I doubled it. I may have put too much batter on the griddle for each one. It was very thick, so I should have added a little more buttermilk. Worth trying again though.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Great recipe ! Will definitely make again
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#0#Very good pancakes. Added about 2 Tablespoons of milk a little at a time. Slightly chewy because of the oatmeal, but tasty and sweet. Needed very little syrup on top. Pancakes we're light but very filling. Will process the oatmeal next time to see if I like them better. Will also add some vanilla next time for added flavor. Added blueberries to the mixture. Also used white wheat flour as that is what I had. Will use this recipe again. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These p-cakes are a wonderful - grab and go - brkfast. I add walnuts and raisins & munch with my morning coffee.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#0#Just made these as directed except I added a mashed up banana and they were great! My three boys gobbled these up and wanted more.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These were a total surprise to me! When I read the ingredients it sounded like nothing I ever tried so I wanted to review it for sure. I was expecting them to be really sweet but they weren't at all. The batter was much thicker than I am used to but that was just fine. I didn't have whole wheat flour so I just used regular and I had no buttermilk so I used what I had in the fridge. The only thing I would edit about the directions for this recipe is you should have a cooking temp on there because I didn't realize that they should be cooked at a lower temp because of how thick and it seems a few others had that issue as well. If someone would like thinner pancakes they could easily just add more milk until the get the right consistency for them. Great recipe really nice job I will make it again for sure. Thanks for sharing! 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#I've made these many times now - they are hearty and tasty! I've begun adding a chopped apple and a handful of chopped walnuts to the batter - takes it up another notch. Because this batter is so thick, I cook them at a slightly lower temp on the griddle - otherwise they tend to get overly brown on the outside before the inside is done. I use buttermilk powder - stirring the powder in with the dry ingredients and using 1 cup of water with the other wet ingredients (egg and oil). As long as I have all of the ingredients on the counter, I make up several batches of the dry ingredients in zipper bags and store them in the refrigerator. Makes a really quick and easy meal any time of the day!! 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#1#My husband and I try to eat healthy. When I saw this recipe (we love pancakes) I decided to make them, BUT I did make a few changes. I replaced the whole wheat flour with white whole wheat, which is not as bitter as whole wheat flour and the brown sugar with a Tablespoon of Agave syrup (which gave it a little more moisture). I also replaced the vegetable oil with the same amount of extra light olive oil and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. The pancakes - YUM !!!!!!! You could also replace the brown sugar with a tablespoon of pure maple syrup which would give it a little more brown sugar taste. I never use whole wheat flour anymore, I strictly use the white whole wheat which can be used in recipes calling for whole wheat flour.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#I am not a fan of pancakes, so used this to make waffles. They were very good, I loved the texture and hint of brown sugar taste! Great for a change.I keep dried buttermilk on hand, but after reading another review, thought I would add that you can also use 1T. vinegar plus enough milk to make 1 cup as a buttermilk substitute.I usually make a large batch of waffles, then re-heat in the toaster, but for some reason, these seemed a bit dry when I re-heated them. You probably would not have the same problem with pancakes.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These were wonderful! Light and fluffy, but still filling. Great tasting!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#0#I made these last night for dinner with eggs and ham. They were the lightest and most flavorful pancakes I've ever seen. The wonderful nutty sweet flavor is sadly hidden when you add the syrup (although you don't need much) and butter.I got 7 pancakes from the recipe using the 1/3 c. measure. I didn't have wheat flour so made them with 1 c. all-purpose flour and it worked fine. I read a review about the cakes being dry. That is my thought on using wheat flour. I have never made anything with it that hasn't turned out terrible dry so I'm wondering if her cakes were dry from the wheat flour and not the oatmeal.Here is something I tried for the first time and I was amazed. I never buy buttermilk so was reading the other day to see if my method of adding 1 T. lemon juice to 1 c. of milk is a close substitute. The article said that it is fine but sometimes will give off the taste of the lemon. They suggested the closest sub to buttermilk is to add 1-1/2 tsp. cream of tartar to the dry ingredients for very cup of milk. They said it is very hard to find any differences in using that compared to products made with buttermilk. Maybe that's why they were so light they nearly floated off the plate! 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#I added a banana. So tasty
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These were good and I love the idea of putting oatmeal and whole wheat flour into pancakes to make them healthier and keep the kids fuller longer. I thought the oatmeal seemed a little dry in them, so next time I might add a little more milk and let them sit a few minutes before cooking them. Update- I have found that if I let the batter sit for a few minutes before making them that the oatmeal is no longer dry in the pancakes and they are perfect! Also, the leftovers make excellent sandwiches with ham and swiss cheese!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These have the perfect combination of sweetness! I love how it uses whole wheat and oatmeal. I'm always trying to find new ways to eat whole grains and I love these pancakes as a way to do so. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Made these for breakfast this morning. Big hit! Nicely sweet, just used a little syrup. Doubled the recipe and got 13 pancakes.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#This was a hit at my house and very easy to make. I didn't have the wheat flour handy so I used more of the regular flour. I see you are able to freeze and reheat. I was hoping to make the silver dollar version of this for a ladies brunch I'm having. To save time, was wondering if I can make them all the night before, cool and freeze them and then use the reheating instructions. Would love to hear from someone who has tried to reheat and how they measured up. :) 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#0#Delicious! My husband was a skeptic with the oatmeal in the batter but was quickly won over. They are very filling and need only a small bit of syrup.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Great recipe. I added vanilla to the batter and pulsed the oats a bit in the food processor before adding to the rest of the dry ingredients. I will definitely make these again.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#0#I run the oats through my magic bullet so it is more of an oat flour.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Super delicious! The only thing was I found was they burned really quickly. Didn't impact the flavour at all though. Served them with fresh made Strawberry Syrup from this site. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Delicious! I did swap out the all purpose flour for buckwheat flour and added a handful of pumpkin seeds, but otherwise made them as written. Definitely tasty enough to forgo the syrup, and very filling.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#The recipe only made 5 pancakes, which was just right for 3 people. They were very filling. They turned out a little dense and dry - I recommend adding more liquid as some others have suggested. Not too sweet, thankfully, because they needed maple syrup for moisture. I will probably look for another pancake recipe to try.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#My family made faces when I told them what I was making. Now, these are the only pancakes they want to have!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These are awesome!! Very filling, great tasting pancake. I did find that buttermilk made them almost too thick so I use 1 T lemon juice in 1 C of regular milk. Plan to try adding vanilla as some have suggested and maybe a few chocolate chips. Yum!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#I make these about 2 times a week. They are delicious and very filling. I leave out the brown sugar and add a little more than 1/4 cup of Craisins and also add 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I have also made them with the brown sugar included, great this way too, but they do brown quicker. They are wonderful served with real Maple syrup!!!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#0#Wow these are amazing! Sweet enough on their own that syrup is unnecessary. I like them with applesauce. My 18-month old is a pancake nut and he loved these. This recipe is definitely going in my recipe book!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Very Good Flavor and Texture!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Excellent, will make again. I doubled the recipe and it made exactly 10 pancakes with 1/3 cup of batter each. These are a hearty, stick-to-your-ribs kind of pancake because of the oatmeal...
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#I served a stack of the for dinner one evening. I added a handful of blueberries to the batter. My husband liked them for his dinner.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#0#Love this recipe. I place all the dry ingredients in an airtight container with the instructions for preparation taped to the outside of the container. Just add the wet ingredients and you have your own'prepared' pancake mix. Makes for a quicker preparation when my family comes for weekend visits! 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#My family loves this recipe, and these fill my kids up faster than traditional pancakes. My kids still insist on syrup, but they are sweet enough to have them plain. I like them with unsweetened applesauce!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Great! Just read the recipe and threw them together. Delicious. No syrup necessary.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#0#Fantastic! I added 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon, vanilla, and baking powder. And used melted butter instead of oil. They taste like oatmeal cookies! I got 8 small pancakes out of it and my husband and I ate them all. No need for syrup!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#This is my go to pancake recipe - Wednesday morning is pancake day at our house! 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Very good!!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#MMM! Very, very good. The taste reminded me of doughnut. The mixture made me seven/eight pancakes. I hope'd they'd be filling with the oats, but two didn't seem enough... though I did stop at two... I could have ganneted the whole lot. Super. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#1#0#Delicious. My mom doubles the recipe and makes these for my kids - they love them! They request them for dinner frequently.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#My kids have texture issues, so we grind down the oats to a flour and they love this recipe. A new family favorite.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#My husband is not a pancake lover, but it has now changed after I tried this recipe. I make a batch of these every weekend, and he eats them through the week for breakfast. I love the fact they have oatmeal. I add blueberries for him. Dee-licious!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#This is a keeper! It not only went in my online recipe box at TOH but on a 3x5 card into my real recipe box. I didn't have buttermilk so used low-fat milk with lemon juice and just a pinch of salt since I'm cutting back on salt. I like to make pancakes and freeze them so I have a quick breakfast already ready to eat. I ended up eating three of these before I got them all made. If you need a quick breakfast, freeze these individually. Take one out, put in a bowl, put yogurt on it and frozen fruit and walnuts or pecans, cover and put in fridge. Next morning it's ready to eat. Sprinkle cinnamon on it! Thanks for sharing your recipe! Its good and is high in fiber also! 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#This was excellent! I substituted 1/2 of the brown sugar with Splenda to lower the sugar content, added a little less than 1/2 t. salt, and they tasted great! Very filling. My batch made 11 4-inch pancakes, which were plenty. Plus, since it didn't make too many, I wasn't standing over the stove too long. Will definitely make again. Thank you for the healthier breakfast food! 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#YUM! Loved them! I followed the recipe exactly other than the buttermilk. I used a cup of milk soured w/ 1 tablespoon vinegar. The recipe only made 6 pancakes plus one tiny pancake, but they are very filling.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#THE best pancake EVER! And I don't(didn't) like pancakes. I followed the recipe exactly then added cinnamon at the last minute. No syrup necessary! Delicious! 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These are delicious! Definitely my go-to pancake recipe!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These are soooo good. I have made them 4 or 5 times since finding the recipe. Can't wait to try them with warmed apples slices this fall. This recipe is a keeper . 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These were delicious! The batter was very thick and only made 8 - 1/3 cup pancakes for me. My daughter, who normal doesn't like pancakes, ate these all up!! 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These were the perfect addition to our breakfast for dinner meal. They have a bit of a dry texture but soak up the syrup well and become moist. A homemade chocolate sauce or something similar would be divine over the top to pair with the brown sugar and oatmeal flavor. I might try that the next time! 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Absolutely delicious. I have tried many pancakes from these recipes and I love all of them. Cant really choose just one favorite
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#nice wholesome taste and texture, but a little too sweet for my taste.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#1#Very delicious, tasted like doughnuts and were very sweet. Imwould modifynthe recipe to make it more diabetic friendly. I added vanilla, cinnamon and poudre douce which probably gave it moremof the dessert flavour. No syrup required! Yummy!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#We loved these pancakes! I'm trying to rate this as a five-star, but can't see the stars, so not sure if it's working. I doubled the recipe, because I thought it wouldn't so I could have leftovers for breakfast before school, but didn't have much left, they were so good! I also put in some sliced almonds and a little cinnamon. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These were great. I didn't use as much brown sugar as I thought they might be too sweet. Next time I will use the right amount. My husband thought they were great. I think this will become our new go to recipe for pancakes. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Very Good. I even tried baking them like cookies in the oven. Yum!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#I would like to add that i aslo used jemimie 's idea with the Bannana, Sliced in thirds lengthwise then shaved slices off to curl across the top. these were absolutely fabulous pancakes. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#I made this as a Mothers Day breakfast for my sweetheart recently, she loved it and everyone else loved it as well. I would most assuredly make this again, even for a normal weekend breakfast. Thank you very much for the recipe, LOVED it.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These were delicious. Very filling. If I had made each pancake 3 or 4 , then I might have gotten 10 pancakes, but I did not. I had some big ones for me and little ones for the my kids. I added a tablespoon of melted butter in place of one tablespoon of oil, but it probably wasn't necessary. I also added a heaping 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and was really glad I did. Wonderful. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#I made these for breakfast last Saturday and they were a hit. They are quite heavy and really soak up the syrup. I think next time I'll try heating up some frozen berries to put over them to cut a little bit on the calories. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Added cinnamon & nutmeg like others. A little water because batter was so thick too. But it is nice to eat a substantial pancake and not one that is tasteless. Have made it twice. So hearty and good!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Substituted 3/4 c low fat vanilla yogurt and a little over 1/4 c milk for the buttermilk. Tasted fantastic and needed no syrup. Served with a dollop of whipped cream and the kids went wild. Definitely will be our new go-to pancake recipe!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Also, since these are so flavorful on their own, I used sliced bananas as the only topping. Yummy! Hubby liked his with Greek yogurt.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Made these this morning-awesome! Best pancakes I think I've ever had. The recipe says it makes 10, but that must be 10 really small pancakes. I made the recipe and a half and got eight 6 to 8 inch pancakes. I did throw in a handful of walnuts also which added a nice texture to an already delicious pancake. Also, I didn't have quick cooking oatmeal, just the regular, and the substitution was fine. Highly recommend these pancakes, and thanks for sharing this recipe. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#This is one of the best pancake recipes ever. We have made them over and over again. I serve them with the Amish Breakfast Casserole and my family thinks I am just wonderful. I have to triple the recipe.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#This is one of the best pancake recipes ever. We have made them over and over again. I serve them with the Amish Breakfast Casserole and my family thinks I am just wonderful.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Very good but too many unnecessary ingredients. I'll continue using my moms recipe.....leftover oatmeal from breakfast, an egg, a little flour and enough milk to make a batter. Unbelievably light & served with hot, brown sugar syrup. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Very good version of pancakes. I have made these a couple times. Love them.Also like to add some cinnamon and spices like that!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Delicious! And for those who are concerned about the salt ,,, the ratio of salt to amont of flour and oats is perfect.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Good. Used pumkpkin spice Country Crock spread on top. No need for syrup. Thought they would be good as an egg sandwich w/ fried egg between two pancakes.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#For the 2 of us old folks this recipe is too much because it is so filling, so next time I will halve the ingredients. I forgot the salt, but we didn't miss it! Very good! 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These are very, very similar to the Hearty Oatmeal Pancakes also found on this site. I love them both!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#In spite of no buttermilk - used Greek unflavored yogurt - so doubled the milk and added cinnamon, the 7 pancakes turned out to be delicious. This recipe is a keeper and will be repeated. Thanks for sharing, Sharon!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#I was just wondering what would happen as another lady thought it was too much. I am going to try this recepie anyway.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These are very good! Happylady 13 and Avilda-you should not be worried about that little bit of salt! If you leave out the salt the only effect on the recipe would be that it wouldn't taste as good! I can't believe that you don't use any salt at all and that 1/2 would be that bad for you!!! 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#what would happen if you cut the salt?
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Awesome! Pancakes are an all-time fav here at our house. These are more wholesome and healthier than the kind I usually make! Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#I am concerned with the amount of sodium.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Absolutely delicious! Will definitely be making them alot more!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#We were just sad this didn't make more! I would not call this 5 servings. It was just barely enough for the 3 of us and my son is only 5! 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These are a delicious alternative to regular pancakes. I make them all the time.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#A new fav in our house. I used only wheat flour and also added cinnamon and nutmegMy husband absolutely loves them..
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#A unique spin on pancakes! Every time I make these for a brunch or breakfast potluck, everyone wants the recipe!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These were fantastic! Very easy and healthy. I loved how they were very filling! I definitely would recommend this!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#This will become my new go-to pancake recipe! I loved the taste and they don't get so soggy from the syrup! I did use only white flour (instead of the whole wheat) and I found we needed to add a little more buttermilk to make the batter the right consistency. Excellent recipe! Thanks! 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#These pancakes are so delicious and filling. I added two ripe bananas, cinnamon and nutmeg, which eliminated the need for syrup. This will be my go to recipe from now on. Thank you!
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#Very easy to make! Used whole milk instead of buttermilk cause it's what I had on hand. Added A tsp of cinnamon and some freshly grated nutmeg as well. They are very filling and tasty! 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#I made these pancakes for breakfast, and added chocolate chips as I was cooking them,as hubby is a choc a holic. We thought they were great.
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#I made four Taste of Home pancake recipes recently, and I like this one the best. When I make them next time, I'll probably add some more buttermilk. Otherwise, they were great, hearty pancakes. You would never know there is wheat flour in them. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#I added cinnamon to these pancakes and they were yummy. More filling than regular pancakes.Lexkygirl
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#They are a lot more filling than buttermilk pancakes. You don't eat as many. 
Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes#0#0#THESE ARE WELL WORTH TRYING. YOU WON'T REGRET IT. I USED ONE CUP OF ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR, BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE ANY WHEAT. THEY WERE SIMPLY DELICIOUS. 
Lime Chicken Tacos#7#1#I rubbed chili powder, cumin, paprika, and oregano on the outside and cooked it in the slow cooker with 1 cup of lime juice for 3 to 4 hours on low (cooks faster in liquid). Comes out juicy, delicious, and limey! I followed the recipe after that. Very delicious! I've never had lime chicken before but this was amazing. Even my 9 year old went crazy saying these were the best tacos I've ever made. Thanks for the inspiration! 
Lime Chicken Tacos#5#1#Made as per recipe but added a can of green chiles and fresh tomato sauce in place of the salsa...very good.
Lime Chicken Tacos#3#1#Quick, easy, and yummy recipe! Lime in dishes is a favorite at our house. Cooked the chicken until tender and done on the stovetop then added the rest of the filling ingredients to heat through. Topped filled tortillas with sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, & taco sauce.
Lime Chicken Tacos#3#0#The dish was easy to make and the flavor was good, however the chicken was rather dry. I feel like it should have been cooked for a little less time.
Lime Chicken Tacos#1#0#Always go to recipes. So easy especially with homemade salsa thrown in. Even my picky eaters love this.
Lime Chicken Tacos#1#11#Awful.These were so bland. I made them exactly as written and I had to make a decision whether to just throw away or try to salvage. I ended up adding salt, garlic, milk, cheese. Cooked some pasta and made a Chicken mac n cheese. It was edible and saved 1 1/2 pounds of chicken breast.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#This recipe was so easy to make and tasted absolutely delicious...I can't wait to make it again! 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#1#Chicken was real good
Lime Chicken Tacos#3#0#This was so good!... and so easy to put together. The lime was very subtle. We topped the tacos with sautéed red and green pepper strips and onions, which is a favorite. We also used lettuce, chunks of avocado, and of course sharp cheddar cheese. I doubled the recipe, and had plenty of the chicken mixture to freeze for a later meal when grandkids stop over.
Lime Chicken Tacos#1#0#This was quite delicious! I juiced 1.5 limes (used the other half of a lime for garnish), which was about 4.5 tbsp. I cut back on the chili powder (about 1.5 tsp), and instead of mixing them, I sprinkled the powder on each piece of chicken, then poured in the lime juice. I cooked it for 5 hours, shredded the chicken and added in the salsa and corn, then only cooked it all for an additional 15 minutes or so while my sides finished cooking. The chicken was perfect. I could actually taste the lime, but it wasn't overpowering. I will be doing the same ratio next time. We really loved this recipe, and it tasted great topped with some lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and avocado. I'll definitely be doing this one again. 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#I like this recipe, toss it in the crockpot
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#We made this chicken for a taco bar for a friends rehearsal dinner. We left out the corn and chili powder to help it appeal to even the pickiest guests. It was moist and delicious, with just the right amount of lime flavor coming through. I used Jack's (Garden Fresh) fresh salsa and I think that boosted the flavor compared to jarred chunky salsa. This is a keeper. The leftovers freeze great as well. 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#2#This was bland and disappointing.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#I liked the lime flavor, but expected more spiciness. Will try using hot salsa next time.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Tasty quick meal with lots of options.
Lime Chicken Tacos#1#0#This a fantastic family, summertime recipe! The chicken is jammed packed with flavor! A TRUE FAMILY FAVORITE!!!!!!!!!!! 
Lime Chicken Tacos#1#0#This recipe has been a favorite of ours for years. Quick, easy & great flavor. I use the leftover chicken to make enchiladas.
Lime Chicken Tacos#1#0#This was delicious! It makes for a great meal that is quick and easy to make. I did up some peppers and onions to go with it.
Lime Chicken Tacos#1#0#Can't wait to try this! I'm from Boise too!! 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#love this. have been making it for years and shared it many many times since it first appeared in the magazine
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#1#Very easy and delicious!. great fast meal. Love the lime flavor.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Made the recipe exactly as written, but cut in half for just 2 of us. Used mild salsa, as we aren't big heat fans and kept the lime juice/chili powder ratio as is. Wonderful! We decided this is definitely a keeper and will be made again and again. So easy, so quick after chicken was cooked. Yum-Yum! 
Lime Chicken Tacos#1#0#I was really impressed with this. I had just over 1.5 lbs of chicken breasts, and after pretty much exactly 5 hours exactly it shredded incredibly easily. The flavor was really good too. I've never been one to put salsa on my tacos or burritos (I'm more of a pico de gallo person), this was super good. It also made enough that I'm going to definitely get more than a few meals out of it. Easy, quick and cheap.By the way, I bought a can of corn, accidentally got creamed corn, and (while this was the first time I made this, so I don't know how it's supposed be exactly), I don't think it changed anything. The salsa has enough liquid that it got absorbed without an issue.I'm definitely making this again. 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Very good. I cooked for 4.5 hours and meat was starting to dry out, next time I will check it at 4 hours. I had to use mainly salsa verde since I didn't have enough tomato based salsa and I did add a little salt. 
Lime Chicken Tacos#1#0#These are great. The only change I made was to add a can of black beans.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#So easy to make, but absolutely delicious! One of our favorites!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#This was so easy to throw together in the morning before work. I used frozen chicken so I let it cook longer than the recommended 5-6 hours. It had such a good taste!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Is pretty simple and tasty and inecpensive
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Quick and easy; great way to use leftover lime chicken and jasmine coconut rice.
Lime Chicken Tacos#1#0#I thought this recipe was very easy to make. I liked it but not for tacos. I use it as a topping for big tostada bowls.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#I made the recipe as written. Very tasty. Even my picky husband liked it.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#This is a great low fat meal and super easy! Some of my family don't like corn so I substitute black beans. Yummy! 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#This recipe is a great meal to throw in your crockpot and come home to a yummy meal! My family doesn't like corn, so I substitute it with black beans! 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#I make this recipe all the time. I always double it so I have leftover meat to use in other recipes. I put the salsa in at the very beginning. At the end, I shred the chicken, add 2 cans of rinsed and drained black beans and 1 can of drained corn. This meat works perfectly for enchiladas, spicy taco soup (just add chicken broth & a can of rotel, top with tortilla chips & cheese) and is great for quesadillas (just drain the juice, add cheese & toast) It's really an excellent recipe and base for lots of other recipes. My family loves it! 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#I added fresh salsa and the corn at the beginning of the cook time and it really marinated the chicken well!!! This made it very tender and shredded with ease. It was absolutely delish !!!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Our family loved it! So easy and delicious.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#This recipe is delicious! I always add a little extra lime juice and make sure you buy very good/flavorful salsa or this recipe does tend to come out bland (which is why it got 4 instead of 5 stars). My husband and I love these tacos with all the fixings!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#A simple recipe that lends itself to adapting to personal tastes. I liked the lime flavor--next time will add more lime. I had to leave out the corn for dietary restrictions.Very, very tasty!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Made this for children and adults. The only change suggested was to add a bit of cilantro.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Made for a luncheon and everyone really liked it! I did add chopped cilantro and 1/4 cup of concentrated limeade since I really like lime and cilantro.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Didn't have much flavor.But i did add hot salsa to give it more kick 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#I had to make it faster so I eliminated the slow cooker & used 2 12.5 oz. cans of chicken & just warmed it up in microwave. Next time I'll change chili powder amount by cutting in half. Very tasty! 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Very easy and really good - a nice change of pace from regular tacos.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Meh. Not a very good taco recipe.If your rating it to Taco Bell then it would have more stars.THe chicken came out bland, once all the topping were on and added a few last minute seasonings it became edible.This inspired me to now go submit my Mojito Lime Tacos.
Lime Chicken Tacos#1#0#These tacos were so delicious! I found I didn't have any chili powder handy, so I used taco seasoning mix & added 2 T. more of lime juice. I also added some canned chopped green chilies. I'm making some more today & thought I would add some chopped onion & a can of drained & rinsed black beans. Yummy!! 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#This was amazing. The chicken was very juicy and full of flavor. I will definitely make this again!!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#This was so easy and good. I used fresh limes, there were on sale, and definitely more then the recipe called for. I also used about 1 tsp of chili powder instead of the 1 tbl...my husband ate about 5 of them...and he is a fussy eater!!!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Yum! Simple and delicious:) I added some fresh cilantro when I added the salsa and corn.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#This is a quick & tasty recipe. Not sure where the other reader's saltiness was from unless it was from too salty a salsa or from the cheese as there is no added salt here. 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#these are so good and weightwatcher points friendly and the whole family loves them
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#This is a favorite in our family!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#1#This recipes was way too salty.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#SO SO SO easy and very tasty. We topped with cheese and shredded lettuce.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#This is a great go-to recipe for our family! I've also used it to serve supper to our church youth group, and for a meal for families with new babies, etc.I also use the lime juice & chili powder mixture from this recipe to marinate chicken strips. Fast & easy, and they don't need to marinate for very long to pick up the flavor. 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Love them! I always add a little extra chili powder and lime juice and I put them on hard taco shells or make the chicken for nachos! family favorite!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#This is a staple in my house now. Such an easy meal to fix and it tastes great. My children are huge fans!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#A family favorite!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#I like this recipe a lot,it's so easy to make,and makes enough tasty leftovers for a few more meals. 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#family loved it - there was still a lot of room in the crock pot - and it was popular - would easily double for a party or double and freeze leftovers.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#So good and it makes enough to feed a large family!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Made this for a get together this last weekend. The taste of the chicken is good but the texture was just terrible. Would not make again.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#This is a staple at our house, we call it Taco Tuesday! We love it! I serve it with a little cheese and sour cream too. My kids love it and the leftovers are great on a bed of lettuce for lunch the next day!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#So delicious and so easy to make! Instead of using a slow cooker, we cooked the chicken over the stove in a little bit of chicken broth. They were absolutely delicious!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#When my grown picky kids go back for 2nd and 3rds, I know I have a keeper! I don't know about the 12 servings--6 at my house. 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#This recipe is so good! Super easy to make and such fantastic flavor!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#We love this! Even my picky two year twins love to eat the chicken.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#this recipe is awesome!!! I had some chicken already cooked up, so ommited step one and added all the ingredients together and cooked in the crockpot till it was all heated throughly. I will deffintly fix this again....
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#I make lots of slow cooker meals and this was a great change from the ordinary stews etc. I followed the recipe exactly and we all enjoyed it.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#We did not like this at all. The chili powder was too overwhelming and I think taco seasoning would be a much better choice.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Super easy and very filling!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Delicious! I used left over rotisserie chiken that I shredded add all ingredients together and just heated through. It took a about 20 min total. What a time saver and it's a great combination of flavors! 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Very good flavor and super easy to make. Great for those days you just want to have super ready when you get home from work.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Excellent recipe. Leftovers can be used for quesdillas, burritos and even tortilla soup. Chicken has a wonderful flavor with lime juice and chili powder.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#I made this on Saturday and it was SOOOO good. One of my new favorite recipes. The chicken shredded so easily. Substituted chili powder for taco seasoning, added black beans and used a can of green chiles/tomatoes instead of salsa and added extra lime.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Soooooooo good and soooooooo easy!!! This is now going to be one of my standard go-to recipes that I will make over and over and over again.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Wonderful and so easy!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Turned out fabulously! I loved how easy the chicken was to shred up. I was a bit concerned when I started to make it thinking the lime and chili seasoning wasn't enough and the recipe would burn but it didn't and made it's own juices with it. The only suggestion I have is to heat it longer than 30mins. The finished product made a lot. Was a bit drippy but was still very good. Had plenty leftover meat mixture and used it for lunch the following date and crushed up some organic blue tortilla chips and mixed in with it. Super yummy that way too! Overall happy with this and would make it again since my picky family really enjoyed it 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#We have made this several times and my family loves it. We've made tacos, burritos, and chicken taco salads with it. But the best yet, according to my son, was using the lime chicken mixture to make chicken enchiladas. Just roll the chicken in tortillas, cover with enchilada sauce, bake for 15 min. cover with shredded cheddar cheese and bake for another 10 -15 min. It was awesome! 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#My family usually loves Mexican food, but neither my husband nor I cared for it at all. I was very disappointed.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#Love this recipe!!! I cook this when I am entertaining and make a taco bar for friends to enjoy! Everyone always wants to know when I'm having another taco night! Pair with freshly made sides, chips, salsa, sour cream and the works (not to mention a variety of margaritas) this recipe has never failed me and everyone always asks for the recipe when we're done! 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#I have made this several times - yummy ! Also freezes well for a quick last minute supper.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#I used a can of green chilesand tomato instead of the salsa and left out the corn. Really easy and enjoyed by all ages.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#This is DELICIOUS!!!
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#I have made this a few times for my husband and his buddies, it was a hit. I subsituted black beans for the corn.
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0# DIL made this when I was visiting, and now I make it too. It's become a family favorite. 
Lime Chicken Tacos#0#0#So easy and flavorful! 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#I'm going to make this tomorrow but will add the flour to the mushrooms and saute a bit to get the flour-y taste out and then add some white wine and the stock. I also like thyme with mushrooms and will probably use some heavy cream as the soup looks a little thin in the video. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#3#1#Just made this for lunch. Upped the seasonings a bit and had a shallot I needed to use so went with that. Also added some dry white wine. This was quick and easy and I have some leftover for tomorrow!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#9#1#This is a good soup as is or with additives. The last time I made this as a dinner soup and added 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder, 1/4 cup of Chablis wine, some freshly cooked spinach, some chopped basil, and about a cup of cooked, chopped chicken. So good! Thank you for a very tasty and versatile soup.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#8#1#Really tasty soup. I actually made this for a friend while she was in a rehab center after a fall. She loved it! It has been in our regular rotation for a while. Definitely a keeper
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#23#6#I have been making this soup for years, fall through spring. The beauty of this recipe is it is delicious as is, but is also adaptable. We, like so many others, begin with this basic recipe and enhance it to meet our specific tastes by sauteeing onions, carrots, celery, baby spinach, one minced clove of garlic, 1/8 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and one tablespoon of Madeira wine with the mushrooms before blending everything. Before adding the cream, I put half of the blended mix into a freezer container and allow it to cool completely before freezing. Then we have soup for one night in the weeks to come and I add cream and three sprigs of thyme to the inviting mix waiting in the pan.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#21#1#I made this tonight because it just sounded comforting and I had the ingredients on hand. It was simply delightful!! I halved the recipe because Im only cooking for one and I wanted leftovers for tomorrow. I did add a little bit more salt and pepper but that's personal preference and I know many watch their sodium intake. This is DEFINITELY staying in rotation!! After tasting it I felt no need to add garlic or hot sauce or anything else. I love that mushroom taste and had no need to mask it. Thank you for an amazing recipe!!! 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#16#3#I made this soup this morning, as I loved the simple ingredients and had some Cream I needed to use up. It turned out great. Such a wonderful surprise for the first time making Cream of Mushroom soup. I most certainly will make again and share this recipe.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#16#5#I tried this because mushrooms were buy one get one free and I wanted to get rid of them. I followed the recipe only thing I did do was different was added 2p milk instead of half and half I didnt have. and Im amazed how well this did turn out its really good thanks for this recipe thumbs up
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#5#2#I am anxious to try this recipe. My grandaughter has Celiac so I need to make this with cornstarch. Can anyone tell me how much cornstarch vs flour I need to use?
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#4#1#This recipe is wonderful! Thanks Anne and thanks to your daughter-in-law.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#3#1#Very good
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#23#7#My husband said this was a mistake to make. Through all the yummy noises, he managed to say it was bc I going to have to make this all the time! He always crushes up crackers in any and all soups I make but not this time. I did add one clove of garlic, chopped the mushrooms into small pieces and this was indeed an exceptional recipe. Highly recommend this easy and quick to make soup. TY Anne Kulick and Taste Of Home for the delish recipe!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#9#7#What a super easy recipe! I love cream of mushroom soup but had never made it from scratch. I'm with some other posters, it is a bit bland. On the first try I added more salt and pepper with a 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic. It was delicious. I may try adding extra seasoning on the next round. Definitely adding this to my soup files!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#6#12#This was great, I just added my own touch as always.. more spices and roasted garlic and a secret ingredient;)
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#11#8#My family gets excited when they know I'm making this. I'm still working on modifications as I personally find it a bit bland, but fresh thyme, garlic powder and even tobasco as another poster mentioned make it a bit more interesting. I just use 2% lactose free milk and get the consistency I like. White wine would be a nice addition. 4 stars for an excellent base recipe that needs modification.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#9#37#Half and half is NOT cream. It's half milk and half light cream. You could get the same effect with 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup light cream. That said, this recipe is not very flavorful. It needed garlic for a start, and one commenter suggested adding some sherry--any white wine would help. I added a couple of quick grates of nutmeg--be careful not to overdo this as a tiny bit goes a long way. A little bit of thyme would be a good idea, too. I added a dash of tabasco, maybe 1/16 to 1/8 of a tsp--not enough to add any heat, but it did help to open up the flavor 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#8#4#I added asparagus and thyme and upped the salt and pepper . I like it, but think it needs more flavor. Next time I might add some sherry.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#41#18#I haven't tried the recipe yet, but it looks delicious. I just wanted to make a comment in response to the information you shared about stock vs broth. I'm not sure what you've shared is accurate. It's my understanding that both stock and broth are made from the bones, the difference is in the length of time they are cooked. Bone broth is cooked longer with the intention of leeching more nutrients from the bones. Chicken stock is more for flavour, where as broth is more for health benefits. I'm open to being challenged on this, just wanted to put forth a different perspective. Thanks.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#13#3#Made this soup a few days ago. Wow! Very easy to make and very flavorful. This will be a staple in my house.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#6#13#I don't care for mushrooms, but my husband and especially my daughter, loves them. We had some mushrooms that needed to be used up before they went bad, so I made this soup. I did add in some of the suggestions in the comments. They liked it. They said it was just like Campbell's cream of mushroom, but with more mushrooms. Well, at least they'll eat the leftovers! 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#8#I liked it but my husband didn't so I am only giving it 3 stars. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#6#1#I have made this for years and it never gets old
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#4#2#Wow this was yummy. Such depth of flavor but simple to make. Great with crusty bread.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#23#3#This recipe looked so good and is so well rated, I made it on Xmas eve. I added thyme and other mushrooms per some of reviews. The family loved it. (My wife was unexpectedly away). I made it again today for my daughter who this morning had a lovely, healthy baby. A special recipe.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#6#1#Super yummy! Did this with almond milk and 1/8 tsp thyme and 1/8 tsp rosemary. Best soup ever!!!! I'm vegetarian so I can't do canned, but this beats campbell's cream of mushroom soup any time! 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#5#2#Like Laura, I used a variety of mushrooms (1 lb), a whole finely chopped sweet onion and then 1/4 tsp thyme in addition to the basic recipe. It has excellent flavor and texture and is so easy to make too.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#4#2#This is the best soup ever! Simple, quick and delicious. I added cooked chicken to mine. I also used the large package of mushrooms. Best ever.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#4#2#Yummy quick and easy soup. I added a pkg of gnocchi to mine
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#3#2#Very good, simple recipe perfect for cold winter days! I substitute chicken with vegetable stock but otherwise make according to directions. Would highly recommend.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#7#2#Just made this.... delicious! I double the recipe & did 1:1 with chicken broth & chicken stock. My family isn't fond of mushrooms per se, so when it was all done, I puréed it in the blender. Easy & so good!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#1#I LOVE this recipe. I substituted 1 liter of mushroom broth for the chicken broth for extra mushroom flavor.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#5#2#This soup is wonderful, full of flavor, and surprisingly simple. I made a couple small adjustments to the original recipe, which are as follows: I doubled the amount of mushrooms to 1 pound using a mixed variety of mushrooms and I used a large onion (chopped). Otherwise, everything else was as written. I like a lot of mushrooms in mushroom soup and 1/2 pound was not nearly enough.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#2#We had this tonight & it was very good. I made as directed with a small pinch of oregano & thyme plus a little extra thickener. It was yummy & I will make again.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#6#4#This recipe is outstandingly good--and easy! For the health conscious, you can substitute 2% milk for cream and it is still delicious. The addition of thyme, marjoram, and oregano spices it up a little. The use of multiple mushroom types adds a mix of textures and flavors. This is an outstanding recipe that could be built on in many ways (next time I will try adding chicken). Thank you for sharing it!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#5#4#I made this recipe, but added cooked ground sausage (drained) and 1/2 anaheim pepper cut in small pieces. It was great!!!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#7#2#Super fantastic. My hubby needed something hearty but liquid and this did the trick. I did read through the comments and did some changes. First I started with crimini mushrooms. When the onions and mushrooms were cooked I added crushed roasted garlic and dried thyme. I also added a splash (1/4 cup) of sherry to the broth. Let it boil for about 15min then added whipping cream, some more butter, another splash of sherry and some fresh lemon juice. Shimmered for about 1/2hr. Pulled out a 1/2 cup of mushrooms, then used the immersion blender to what it was in the pot. Added back the mushrooms set aside. Did add just a little cornstarch to thicken it a little bit more. The extra cooking allowed the flavor to developed. Definitely a keeper recipe. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#6#2#This is without a doubt the best cream a mushroom soup recipe I have ever had! I don't know if it's because I used my own homemade chicken broth but it is hands down the best, I could not stop eating it while it was still in the Pan. Mmm good! 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#3#4#Very good and quick! I used shallots (didn't have onions) and also added some fresh minced garlic and a splash of Sherry when the mushrooms and shallots were just about finished cooking. Also added some dried thyme, heavy cream, and squeezed in some fresh lemon juice...yum!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#1#I made this today
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#2#2#I have a question before I make this. Can I use heavy cream rather than 1/2 and 1/2?
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#1#I always have these ingredients on hand, which is great! I don't have to run to the store when I want to make mushroom soup. Thank you. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#2#The best way to cook mushroom soup.I also add some shredded chicken breasts and corn starch at the end to thicken the soup.Thanks for sharing.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#2#This was so delicious. I added a bit of garlic powder and a little more salt than called for. It was so easy to make! Will for sure make again when I buy mushroom again . Thank you for the recipe! :)
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#1#Best mushroom soup ever
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#1#WOW! If you haven't tried this simple recipe then it's time you do. So easy to make and the flavor is amazing! The recipe itself is great,but like a couple of other reviewers I added a little bit of garlic powder and a splash of olive oil. Thank you for sharing Anne! 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#2#0#I just made this for the second time in a week. OMG it is great and EASY. I saw asparagus on sale and thought ??? Again OMG. I also made a double batch. My husband doesn't eat mushrooms but my best friend does and we are glad not to share with more.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#3#1#This recipe is the best ever. Made the most delicious soup, I highly recommend.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#0#WOW!! So easy .. and delicious. Made it twice already this month. Love it... I added extra mushrooms. I used cornstarch slurry to help thicken. The taste is amazing..
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#0#Love this soup. I have doubled or tripled the mushrooms, added sausage or chopped chicken and used heavy cream. I make it at least twice to three times a month.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#1#I was a little worried after taste tasting after I added the flour. It really tasted like flour. Didn't give up, It did say to simmer to let the flavors meld. Glad I did. It was really tasty! May add some portobellos and a titch of sherry next time. Low calories for a creamy soup. Added benefit. Thanks Anne and other cooks who gave me the thumbs up to try it! 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#2#2#I have made this upwards of 20 times for my family. If they see mushrooms on sale they beg me to make this soup. I should note that my says doesnt like mushrooms and my wife doesnt like mushroom soup. They both still ask me to make this every other week.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#2#0#This soup is absolutely delicious! Fir some reason I always thought mushroom soup was hard to make...well I couldn't have been more wrong. Simple and the results are CROWD PLEASING! I made it for a potluck and x4'd the recipie. I also substituted corn starch for the flour..used less and my gluten free friends were also able to enjoy. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#3#0#I just made this soup - love it ! First time making a creamed soup - but it was easy - I did cheat a little - used table cream and more than called for as I wanted to use it up before Christmas.. Will definitely make this again.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#0#Delicious..also used dried porcini, sherry. Nutmeg.. Reg cream
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#3#0#This soup is amazing!! I used it to make green bean casserole and I will never buy canned cream of mushroom soup again. I'm going to try making cream of chicken soup next. I never realized what a difference the homemade version would be. Thanks so much for the killer recipy. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#2#0#Used mushroom stock instead of chicken stock, also added half tablespoon Better than Bullion mushroom concentrate. Turned out great.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#0#Very good ! I will never buy can again.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#3#0#I just made this according to the recipe, was worried the onion would be too strong or that there would be too earthy of a flavor with the mushrooms. Boy was I wrong! It was delicious and perfect. It was like a thick gravy. I'm going to serve it over biscuits next time. Yummy! 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#0#we do not buy any store bought soup anymore, this is very easy to make and it is so good. i do add a bot of garlic powder and skip the onions and it turns out so good.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#0#Cooked it by the recipe but I did add a little garlic powder as suggested by another review and I am so pleased with the outcome!! It is absolutely delish!!! Tho next time I am going to try adding some cooking sherry also as another reviewer did.....I love cooking sherry and I do believe it will be a wonderful addition to an already great recipe!!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#2#0#Easy and delicious! Added a bit of garlic powder and splash of extra virgin olive oil. Yum!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#0#Is gud
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#I make a couple of changes to it. It was good before but now OMG. First make your own broth. Then use whole cream not half and half. It's makes so creamy. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#Needs to be a little bit thicker for my taste , flavor great
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#This is a winner. I used3 kinda of mushrooms ?? and a lot of extras. Sooo good??
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#0#Omg so easy and good!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#Can Nestle Cream be a substitute for the half-half cream? Loved the original recipe though. Tasty and VERY simple
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#easy and delicious!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#This gets 5 stars for pushing me in the right direction, although I also made very few changes based on earlier reviews. Doubled the recipe (meaning I doubled almost* every ingredient) because 1) hubby loves cream of mushroom soup, and 2) I had a lot of mushrooms I needed to use. *The only ingredient I didn't double was the flour. I also added cooking sherry (which works just fine). I used 4 tbsp. butter, melted. Then added the onion and cooked for about 5 minutes. Then, the flour which I quickly stirred so it was almost a roux, but it was very dry, so that's when I tossed in about 1 tsp. or so of cooking sherry. Next I added 29 oz. of chicken broth (mixed of Swanson's organic and some homemade leftovers) and the mushrooms. I added some thyme because, in my world, pretty much every mushroom dish is a little bit better with thyme (for this I added about 1 tsp.) Then I let it simmer until the onions and mushrooms were soft. NOTE: I did NOT add salt. When the onions and mushrooms were soft, I added a bit of the broth to a combo of 1/2 c. half 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#I've never made mushroom soup before and I'm glad I made this recipe. I absolutly loved it! The only thing I did different is add garlic powder and thyme:-) 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#It's a lazy Sunday between Christmas and New Year's and I'm indulging in my favorite things: reading recipes, cooking, and reading my library book. This soup recipe called out to me as I have all ingredients and it is perfect for this cold day. I deviated just a bit by adding the flour to the vegetables as they were cooking in the butter. I also added a finely chopped stalk of celery because I needed to use it and thought it would enhance the soup. I used evaporated - again because that's what I had available. I thought the soup needed a little something, so I added a sprinkling of thyme and poultry seasoning. I will make this again and again with this modifications. 5 stars and 2 thumbs up. I'm enjoying a mug of the creamy soup right now as I watch a movie. Lynne, TOH Volunteer Field Editor
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#0#I have Celiac so finding cream soups that don't contain flour is next to impossible. I used cornstarch instead of flour and I will never buy any other mushroom soup. This can be used for anything and I absolutely love it. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#Love this soup! It's simple and easy. I love to add garlic salt and lemon thyme. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#I love this recipe, and so does my husband. The base works for any vegetable--just change up the spices. It's great with asparagus and add a pinch of Celery salt. I really don't think you need to use cream; use whole milk and it's still really yummy and thick but not so overly rich. A dash of sherry makes it super elegant for a dinner party--don't use cooking sherry, just regular, cheap brand drinking sherry. Don't overdo it--a splash will do. This is a really flexible recipe that can be used for lots of soup bases. So helpful and I'm sure I'll use it a lot in the future. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#0#This recipe is absolutely what I wanted. Cream of Mushroom is one of my favorite soups, but I've always been intimidated to try making it myself. I assumed it was time consuming. This was super easy and came out perfect. The only changes I made was I used 32 oz of chicken broth (which made it thinner, which I wanted), and I also used a full pound of sliced baby bella mushrooms. I'd definitely do this recipe again and again. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#Delicious! I had about a pound of baby bella mushrooms that I needed to use up and happened to come accross this recipe- made a double batch. I was out of chicken broth so I used vegetable broth. Used fat free half and half because that's what I had on hand. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#Quick is right. Quick and Tasty is even better. I used White Button Mushrooms and Baby Bella Mushrooms. I used Evaporated milk and Cornstartch instead of the flour. Making it slightly healthier. I also used it not only as a soup but after tasting the rich earthiness I decided to use it as a sauce/gravy. My choice for this test. Salisbury Steaks. It could not have been more perfect. One more Taste Of Home Winner fort he New Year.Volunteer Taste of Home Field Editor.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#1#Great and easy recipe! I made it just like the recipe the first time. I made just two little changes the second time I cooked it -- I took half the mushrooms out and pureed the other half in the soup with my immersion blender, then returned the rest to the pot. That helped thicken the soup a lot. It also made it a little creamier when I used heavy cream instead of half and half.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#Normally I make a new recipe as written, but I had sooooo many mushrooms and onions!!! Doubled the butter, mushrooms and onion and left the remaining ingredients as is. OMStars, I love this so very much&lt;3 ...I thought I'd have to get my immersion blender going, but nope! Perfect. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#Excellent. How would you double this soup?
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#You just saved my Sunday dinner!!! I had no cream of Mushroom soup in stock and found this!! Works perfect, needs nothing different added!! Thank you
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#I loved this recipe, it was perfect, although, I did add a little minced garlic. This is a keeper!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#Definitely add some thyme to the onion./ mushroom while sauteing, stir in a bit of sherry, and then the flour before the broth.. (no flour needed if blending all in a food processor), ...no salt if using salted butter and salted chicken broth
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#This was a fast and easy recipe. My grandson who hates mushrooms loves it. He is 14 years old. He just pushed aside the mushrooms and ate the soup. The base must be it. I made it exactly how they said and it turned out great. Very pleased.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#Great recipe. I Almost ate the whole thing myself.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#I'm sorry, the one star is all about the flour. I am actually mad at myself as I should have known better making this recipe. The flour should have been added with the onions and mushrooms and COOKED. All I could taste in the final product was 6 T of raw flour. It ruined the soup for me and I had to dump it as did one of the other reviewers. I am surprised that your daughter in law who is a gourmet cook didn't know this but maybe something got lost in translation. I am posting this, not to be mean but to suggest that this will be a good soup if you cook that flour. Jane 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#Delicious I make and let is sit in refrigerator over night. Husband brought home mushrooms and asked for this soup
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#Amazingly fast, and amazingly delicious! Loved-loved this soup!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#This soup is so easy to make, but the taste seems like you have spent hours on it!! My husband and children love this soup.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#I think this was a great starter recipe. Really, I don't like to read reviews that have altered the original. But...I needed to use portabella mushrooms and tarragon so I'm completely guilty of tweaking. The results were wonderful and I can still hear some scraping of bowls. Thank-you. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#1#I was looking for a cream soup to use in casseroles and stumbled upon this. I just made it an it's quick and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except I only had canned mushrooms in the house, and yes, I used those. It's still really good and beats the heck out of canned soups with canola oil and GMO's in them. I blended it with my immersion blender at the end to make the mushrooms smaller. I did this for use in casseroles and the consistency is great. Next time I might add another tablespoon or 2 of flour to make it thicker, or reduce the liquid. Make sure you wisk the flour into the stock really well before adding it to pot, and boil for a full 2-3 minutes to cook out the flour taste. I will definitely be using this recipe in the future, and next time I will get fresh mushrooms. Looks like enough for 3 casseroles, so I will freeze the rest. Thanks! 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#0#Loved the receipe. I used plain mushrooms and yellow onion and it was great.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#Loved this recipe.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#This was very good and easy. I did add a bit of Sherry, thyme and a bit of tarragon - just because I love tarragon. I had some heavy cream I needed to use so did substitute that for the half and half. Hubby loved the soup and I will definitely make it again. I'm sure the soup will be excellent without the heavy cream and following the recipe as submitted. Thanks for an easy, quick recipe. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#1#Excellent soup. I prepare very low sodium soup, omitting the salt and using very low sodium chicken broth. To make condensed soup add half the liquid (411 g chicken broth and 118 g half-and-half). I've prepared a scaled up condensed version, freezing the left overs in 10-3/4 oz (305 g) servings. I use in any recipe calling for condensed soup. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#1#I added 4 strips of chopped bacon to the onions and used heavy whipping cream since I like my soup real thick. I also use 3 different types of Thai mushrooms that I don't even know the names of due to their wonderful flavor. Because I used the bacon I didn't add any salt. Came out great and will use this recipe for the rest of my life. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#**something changed. I came back here to get a reminder of how to make it, and half-and-half is on the recipe. Doubted my memory and used the half and half. It was so unremarkably bland and THIN. Heavy Cream makes all the difference in the world. Possibly this recipe was tweaked since I saved it? Would rate it 3 stars as-is. Fine for a way to use up mushrooms, but nothing I would serve for a special meal. Use the original heavy cream if you want 5 stars.(previous review) I am trying to let the soup finish cooking, but can't help stealing spoonfuls while it is on the stove. I think ingredient types are key here to get the flavor right. The mushrooms can't be plain white mushrooms. Their flavor is half the taste. I used Crimean but would have loved to use portabella/baby bellas. I also used sweet onions. (Peruvian) I cannot imagine using white or yellow with this. admittedly I fudged and used a whole onion since this is going to be a base for my green bean casserole, and it has plenty of onion flavor in it. Also, at the suggestion of a friend, I added a roux. Accidently made it very dark, but the toasted flavor was perfect. my chicken stock was from a rotisserie chicken and so I omitted salt and pepper. Simply amazing. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#This soup was delicious! I used baby Bella mushrooms sliced very thin. Because others said it tasted like flour, I only used 5 tbsp of flour. Instead of mixing the flour with the broth I added an extra tablespoon of butter to the mushrooms when they were about finished. Then I mixed the flour in with the onion mushroom mix before adding the broth. I also used a little bit more salt.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#I was in the mood for cream of mushroom soup and found this recipe and decided to make it. I only had one package of button mushrooms, 1/2 red onion, and sautéed them in the butter. I only had a 32 oz carton of organic low sodium vegetable broth, and I used the 6 tablespoons of flour in it. Did not notice the flour taste, I did let it cook for a while. I did not have any cream only skim milk, and it came out really good for my taste, it had a nice creamy texture, cream may be too heavy for me. I also had a cooked chicken breast and cut that up and put in as well. I also used Mrs Dash Onion in it for a little kick. I think this recipe is very easy, quick, and I will definitely make again, and get more creative with it. Use more different types of mushrooms, puree some and leave the rest chunky, add some wine. It was so fast to make! Yum! :-) I think I will use this recipe with broccoli as well, might be fun!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#1#I love this!! It was a little thin, next time I will add a little more flour. I did make a roux with the flour first to cook it off and used baby bella mushrooms. Will definitely make this again. I did not taste any flour as some have.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#1#Made this recipe as a side for our BBQ. This was delicious, quick & easy. My husband loved it!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#This recipe is SO easy and SO delicious! I have made it several times both to eat on its own and to use in other recipes. I too had problems with the flour taste and so I tried using corn starch and that solved the problem. I actually think the overall texture of the soup is better using the corn starch. This soup will be a staple in our household. Delicious and healthy.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#Based on the other reviews, I cooked the flour separately with butter as a roux. It was still a bit too much flour in the final taste. I also added some toasted onion powder. That helped cover up the flour flavor. I'll definitely make this again, but I think I'll cut the flour in half. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#0#Excellent! The only change we will make in the future is to chop the mushrooms smaller. We also added about 1-2 tbsp red wine while we sauteed the onions and mushrooms and it was outstanding.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#3#0#This soup was easy and delicious. I took the advice of a couple of reviewers and made a roux of the onion/butter mixture before adding the broth. There was no flour taste! I used more onion than called for and also used baby bella mushroom. Hubby liked this soup and suggested a splash of sherry next time. Will definitely make again.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#This was gross!! Too much flour...yuck!!!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#Very easy and taste great!! Definitely a favorite.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#0#Loved it. Avoided the flour taste by: Saute the onions in butter first. Then add a couple more tbsp. of butter and add flour to that to make a roux (with onions in it). Cook it for a few minutes to get rid of the flour taste. If it's too thick to stir, add a bit more butter, then proceed to add your liquid. Sauteed the mushrooms in a separate pot while the onions were cooking. Yeah, 2 dirty pans, but avoided the floury taste by cooking the roux. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#2#0#Love, love, LOVE this! I used a combo of types of mushrooms made a slurry of the mushroom mixture, flour and 2 cups of the chicken stock to cook out the flour taste. Warmed the remaining stock and then added the slurry to the hot stock; stir often until thickened THEN add the cream and turn down to med/low and let simmer. A few extra steps but OH SO WORTH IT!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#Say good bye to can cream of mushroom soup. I will be making this recipe from now on.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#This was a big disappointment. All I could taste was the flour so anyone that makes this recipe should use less flour. I might make this again but would defintely not use 6 TBS. of flour. I think you need to experiment with this recipe to come up with the correct measurements. I did go ahead and serve this but threw out the remainder.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#I didn't have canned chicken broth so I used granulated broth. Too Salty. Reduced salt liquid broth would have been preferable. Taste was excellant regardless. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#1#1#I thought this was excellent, and so easy. My husband said, You scored! We had this tonight with sandwiches. Great winter night supper. Will make this again for sure. I cooked a couple of cloves with garlic with the onion but made no other changes. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#The perfect mushroom soup:) thank you
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#My husband really likes mushrooms,and always wanted me to make mushroom soup.I could not find a good recipe until I found this one. I was great, fast really easy and had a great taste. I sure that I will make it again and again.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#Delicious!! Very easy to make! One minor change ... I used corn starch instead of flour because I can usually taste the flour unless it's cooked in a roux. 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#I made this delicious recipe yesterday for lunch and I know it will be even tastier reheated for lunch today. One of our favorites. Thanks
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#i am on the fence with this one it was alright nothing to write home about
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#2#Mmmm... so much better than canned soup, and almost as easy! I increased the mushrooms to 4 pints, and sauteed them until they released their liquid and it all evaporated. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. For a great flavor combination, try serving them with TOH's Onion & Cheddar Biscuits (see recipe at https://www.tasteofhome.com/Recipes/Onion---Cheddar-Biscuits ). 
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#very good even i omitted the onion :) i used milk instead of cream, and 2cans of chicken broth is just a bit tooo much, 1 and 1/3 can is enough for me.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#This was wonderful~thanks for the recipe.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#I make this for me and my 7 year old and we LOVE it
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#What a fantastic recipe for those cold and blustery days. I had a little left over homemade turkey broth from Thanksgiving that needed to be used but not enough for the recipe so I added to it with my homemade chicken stock. So easy and quick to make I enjoyed it for lunch today.
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#I used large cremini mushrooms, organic low sodium broth and soy creamer for delicious NON dairy version-then I thickened that and used it for a green bean casserole!!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#This recipe is so VERY easy, I have already in less than two weeks made it twice and also gave the recipe to my friends
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#Delicious!!
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#delicious and easy
Quick Cream of Mushroom Soup#0#0#I made it with 1% milk & only 1 can of chicken broth, still very good. The flour thickens it up plenty.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#5#2#This was delicious as written, then I tried it again tonight with some tweaks just because that's how I roll in the kitchen. This time I chopped up a half pound of shrimp, cooked a package of shrimp-flavored ramen noodles and instead of putting together the spice mix used the seasoning packet from the ramen (I was inspired by Lillie's idea). Then, as suggested by another reviewer, topped with Yum Yum Sauce that I found on The Recipe Critic's ( https://therecipecritic.com/yum-yum-sauce/ ) we absolutely inhaled it. I plan to try this with ground chicken and chicken ramen next, and also again as written but over rice instead of noodles. Excellent, easy weeknight recipe that you can adjust as desired to keep things interesting, thank you for sharing! 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#4#3#This sounds good. I haven't tried the recipe yet so I cannot rate it. But I was wondering if a person could use a package or two of pork flavored Ramen Noodles in place of the Rice Noodles? Along with that question would you need to adjust any of the other seasonings if you used the seasoning packets that come with the Ramen Noodles? 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#2#4#I have made this twice, and we all enjoyed it. A few changes I made - used low-fat ground turkey instead of pork, one medium chopped regular onion instead of green onions which I don't care for, and a lot more soy sauce, as it needed extra seasoning. It makes quite a bit, and the leftovers freeze well. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#3#0#Delicious easy meal. I used impossible meat instead of pork for my vegetarian husband. I also added mushrooms and zucchini. We served it with yum yum sauce and that really took it to next level!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#5#1#Made with mushrooms and bell pepper, no meat.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#Absolutely loved this dish.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#3#0#These are so good, healthy and easy. It is impressive enough for company and comes together quickly so you can plate it for your hungry bellies!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#25#12#Made a couple adjustments...used basmati rice as don't have access to rice noodles and I also used pork sausage instead of ground pork. Used a bag of shredded cabbage rather than shredding it myself. Did garnish with green onions. Had a great flavor. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#7#0#Very good. Like the reviews said, you will need to add spices. Next time we are going to try this with some chicken. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#8#1#What a wonderful easy dish,thanks for another tasty meal. Used coleslaw mix and left out the salt. Very tasty dish!!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#5#I think the recipe is pretty good overall but unhappy with the noodles. Probably the brand because we usually like rice noodles.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#8#1#We really like egg rolls and Chinese stir fry so this was a great combo of the two. I used bagged cabbage and also we served over basmati rice instead of the noodles. I don't like the consistency of rice noodles and we love rice. I'll definitely make this again. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#2#0#Easy recipe. While I loved the rice noodles, family was not thrilled with them. I loved the flavors
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#2#0#Excellent, easy recipe. My first time to use rice noodles & they were delicious. Thank you for yet another recipe that is definitely a keeper. The seasonings were sooo perfect.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#4#7#I liked the overall recipe. I used bagged precut coleslaw mix and the cabbage seamed to really break down. Next time I would buy a head of cabbage and slice it. I also used chicken instead of pork. I would also make additional sauce the next time I make it.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#6#0#I really enjoyed this recipe. I read the comments prior to making and I added more garlic and seasoning (did not add extra salt or soy sauce) and I thought it was quite delicious! My meat and potatoes boyfriend really liked it too! I think this recipe is a keeper and I look forward to making it again and trying different veggie combinations with it.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#2#1#This was a great recipe. I think next time I make it I will definitely add more meat, spices, and soy sauce. This recipe is a keeper!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#3#0#This recipe is fantastic! I opted for the meatless version and used scrambled eggs. I also bumped up the spices a notch...our preference. Hubby and I thought it was great and I can't wait to make it again! 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#3#1#This was excellent, and it was even better as leftovers two days later. The cabbage didn't get wilty at all. I used ground turkey because that was what I had, and next time I'll use fewer noodles. It was so flavorful my cat walked around the table sniffing for tidbits, and she's usually never interested in human food. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#2#0#This was SO GOOD! I loved how easy it was to whip up on a weeknight. Nice flavor. I will definitely make this one again.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#I love Chinese food, but hate the fat and calories that come with it. This satisfies the need for the flavors, but is much healthier than eating an egg roll! I will definitely be making this again. VFE
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#3#Pretty good! My family of four (including one kid who does not like Asian food) really liked this. I did not have sesame oil and I used more soy sauce and ground ginger than the recipe called for. Very flavorful. We all added Chinese Mustard and more soy sauce when eating. I will definitely make this recipe again but I'll be buying pre-shredded cabbage to save time to make this a super quick and easy weeknight dinner. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#This was ok. Mine had no sauce either. Next time i'd add more garlic, more 5-spice(i added that)
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#6#1#This is one of my husband's favorite dishes and I've made this dish numerous times since we first tried it. I use the shredded coleslaw that includes shredded carrots and add additional shredded carrot until it looks right. I also add a little more ground ginger than called for, as we like the additional flavor. I now keep rice noodles on hand just for this recipe. I also save some time by browning a full pound of ground pork ahead of time in the sesame oil, separating it into two 1/2-pound packages and freezing it (just remember to label the package so as to not confuse it for browned ground beef). This dish goes together so quickly with these short cut hacks and you have a delicious alternative to time-consuming conventional egg rolls. Delicious flavor!! 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#2#3#This was super good and so easy with the coleslaw! My husband, friends and I love egg rolls but I totally lack the skill to roll them. I used lo mein noodles because that's what I had on hand and I added more soy sauce when I served it. The only other addition I think I would make is add something crunchy on top like a fried egg roll wrapper. Great recipe will make again. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Giving it a few extra stars only for a change I had to make...My rice noodles looked a lot different than in the video and I think that made a huge difference, unfortunately.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#3#0#Really does taste like an egg roll! If you miss the crunch, you can always add some fried wonton strips to your bowl, but the recipe is perfect and delicious as written. Super simple to make. Great for busy nights when you don't have lots of energy to cook or need to get the kids fed fast. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#3#1#FANTASTIC!! I use red chili sesame oil to spice it up a bit. Other than that, I follow the recipe just as it's written and have never had it turn out less than phenomenal! My husband likes to throw a few chow mein noodles on his for a bit more texture/crunch. Such a family favorite!!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#3#0#We loved this!! My husband said it was a keeper. I used one boneless chicken breast cut into tiny pieces, and sprinkled just a pinch of red pepper flakes. It was a tad dry when I added the noodles, so increased the amount of soy sauce and a little chicken broth to loosen it up. Will definitely be making this often.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Love this
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#1#I'm mystified by all of these reviews... I made this tonight and it was dry and bland. No one liked it at all! Will not be making it again.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#2#0#My whole family loves this (including my 2 and 4 year old; they can't eat it fast enough!) I have made it many times and tried with tofu, ground turkey, scrambled eggs, you name it. So versatile!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#Really fast and easy meal. Ingredients are items that are usually readily available. Definitely a quick go to when hungry .
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#A really fast and easy meal to prep, especially when using the suggested shortcuts. My husband and I loved it. Definitely a keeper.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#Easy, light, delicious! I did use cole slaw mix and it worked great !
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#2#1#We loved it! Quick and light meal. I read previous reviews so I made sure to buy the Chinese 5 spice without reading the the ingredients in the jar, I could have saved myself buying the spice and just added some cinnamon and more ginger. I also just used almost a full 16 oz bag of coleslaw mix to save time. At my local store they had two different kinds of rice noodles, a thin lo mein looking kind and a rounded thin crispy kind.....I used the crispy kind (LaChoy), added some more crunch, we enjoyed it
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#2#1#Great quick meal! I used a bag of coleslaw mix and omitted the noodles. I cut wontons into quarters and deep fried for about 15-20 seconds in peanut oil and served on the side with Sweet Thai Chili.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#Egg roll without the roll! Loved it, wouldn't change a thing but put a jar of Colman's English mustard on the table because I didn't have any Chinese hot mustard. Worked perfectly! East meets West! 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#2#0#This is tasty. The recipe sounded good, but I rarely eat pork. A half pound of cooked, shredded chicken was substituted for the pork. and the serving was topped with some duck sauce. 1 serving was only 2 points (WW). It is tasty and filling. MelanieM
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#This was delicious. I did add some red pepper flakes to spice it up. Will definitely make it again. Someone suggested doubling the sauce, but I thought it was sufficient, though I don't know how it will do as leftovers, i.e., if the noodles will soak up the sauce and be somewhat dry the next day. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#I can't wait to make this! Looks amazing, excellent recipe! 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#Made without changes, except adding some chopped sweet red pepper. Really nice for the summer - quick and light!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Everyone loved it. I did double the first four ingredients as another person suggested.I was told to make it again. It is a keeper.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#I made this the other night and we(hubby and I) like this a lot. I did make one kinda big change, I used one pkg. of Nissin Chow Mein noodle dinner. Since just two of us I used half of vegs but we like it wetter so used all sauce from recipe and what was in pkg too. I have been working very hard to cut down to just 2 servings find this brand has good sauce that works well with most noodle recipes. I have given it just 4 stars because of how much I had to adjust it. I felt it would have been too bland without that change.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#EXCELLENT!!! I MADE THIS WITH 12 EGGS SCRAMBLED INSTEAD OF THE PORK AND A LITTLE DUCK SAUCE. FANTASTIC. MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS LOVED IT
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#This was sooo good, I pretty much followed the recipe, except I did add red pepper and Chinese 5 spice, I like spicy! Will definitely make this again.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#I make this frequently. Double the first 4 ingredients, use pre-cut broccoli slaw for cabbage, use whatever onion on hand, and linguine pasta for rice noodles (dh preference). Very flavorful and leftovers reheat nicely.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#My husband loved this! He asked me to make again next week. I did add a little Chinese 5 Spice to it for a little kick.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#I made this today and it was delicious. I used less ginger because I am not a fan of an overpowering ginger taste. I also used a tenderized pork cutlet, and pounded it more at home and chopped it up. The texture was great and it was lower in fat than the ground pork. Adding a touch of soy sauce to the completed dish made it taste like an egg roll dipped in sauce. I made a half recipe for lunch in my Nordic Ware mini wok and it was perfect. My daughter loved it too and we will be making this again.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#We have an international student from China living with us, and he loves this recipe. We love the seasoning and the cabbage is delicious. I use precooked pad thai noodles.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#2#0#I had chicken on hand and used this instead of pork, mimicking the chicken egg roll. I also used fresh ginger, but felt it could use more seasonings. I will pump up the seasonings next time and try with pork. My husband and I like the dish. It was easy, fast and will probably make again for a quick meal.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#Very good. Needed more flavor but that wasn't hard to augment. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Tasteless
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#Made this exactly as called for, and had a couple of problems. First, it would be way better to cook this in a wok rather than an ordinary skillet. Second, it was extremely dry; the addition of more soy sauce and more sesame oil -- about a tablespoon each -- was perfect. Will definitely make this again, and perhaps try it without the protein at all. Very quick and easy recipe.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#A good taste, but very dry. I'll try adding a little broth (chicken or vegetable). 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#We love this! I make it using shredded coleslaw rather than chop up a head of cabbage. We also use gluten free noodles and gluten free soy sauce so my 10 year old granddaughter with diet restrictions can eat it. (I tried using the angel hair type rice noodles and prefer it with a firmer noodle.) I added two slightly beaten eggs to the cooked pork and cabbage for a reason. Years ago I made egg rolls for Asian friends and they told me I forgot to add the egg. Adding the egg does not alter the taste of the egg roll noodle bowl ingredients.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#7#If I am allergic to soy, is there something I could substitute for it? I'd really like to try it! 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Very tasty, easy to make and good for you. Added some more Pork and soy sauce but seasonings were perfect.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#This meal is AWESOME!! i make it once a month Def a Healthier version to springRolls
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#This is a great recipe and so quick to make. I did sub chicken for the pork as some others had suggested. I added mushrooms, also. I will definitely be making this again.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#1#I have made this, but I added actual egg rolls that I deep fried and cut up into four pieces to it. Sooooo good!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#This was great. So yummy. Kids liked it too which is always a plus. This recipe easy to make. I did you use extra soy sauce in mine. This recipe is 9 Weight Watchers Smart Points.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#This turned out great. We added to our cafeteria menu. It had a really great flavor.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#Both my husband and I thought it had plenty of flavor, but it wasn't overpowering. Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, this recipe is just for the inside of an egg roll. If you normally dip your egg roll in soy sauce, you'll want to add extra soy sauce to this. I used finely shredded cabbage that came in a bag and put several baby carrots in a food processor for the shredded carrots. I did the full amount for everything, but only did 3C finely shredded cabbage and 1C processed carrots. This was because when I was putting them into the pan, these amounts alone looked like a LOT. I couldn't imagine adding more. I also did regular yellow onion, not green. I thought the ratio of veggies/meat/noodles seemed pretty good too. Overall, my husband and I loved this and we can't wait to try it again! 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#This is AWESOME!!!! The seasonings are just right to give the same flavor you would get from an egg roll. My daughter, who normally doesn't like vegetables, ate a large portion and loved it. When I made it, I doubled everything except the cabbage and carrots to make it a little more meaty; it turned out perfect! 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#I like the concept...BUT it is under seasoned. If I make again I would double the seasonings, swap freshly grated ginger for the ground ginger and add a zap of siracha for a little heat. The half pound of ground pork vs. The volume of veggies is way off. Either leave the pork out or double it.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#I'm sorry to say we thought it was quite disappointing. It was missing something but I don't know what. Even tried adding some sweet hot chili sauce but still lacking flavor. Won't be making this again.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#This is wonderful! My husband, who really does not care for cabbage, requests it often. So easy and great for leftovers, too.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#This dish is wonderful. My husband and I enjoyed it. Be careful not to over cook the noodles. Enjoy!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Pretty good as is. I did add more meat, and doubled the seasonings. Our family thought it would be better with something with a crunch. We tried sesame sticks, which actually worked pretty well.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#1#0#My husband and I love this recipe. I add some sugar peas and bamboo shoots. Serve it up on a bed of rice, and pour some home made Edo Japan Terriakyi Sauce on top. Awesome meal, and if there are any leftovers they're also great the next day. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Great! My husband and love it! I've made it so far with chicken and with beef. Both just fine. As with any recipe, adding more soy sauce is your choice. Think about this....normally you dip egg rolls into sauce. They aren't full of sauce to begin with. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Delicious! I did add more soy sauce and added Chinese hot mustard to spice it up a bit. I made it with the rice noodles the first time, but have since left them out and I prefer it with out.I also have made it with ground chicken and it's good, too. Definitely recommend!! 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#1#This was unfortunately horribly under seasoned. I ended up adding more soy sauce, five spice seasoning, garlic salt, more soy sauce....you get the idea. I really wanted to like it & it's a decent starting place for veggies/noodles, but seasoning-wise ---I would not recommend. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#So pleasantly surprised by this recipe. It was better than I expected. I initially thought the ingredients did not allow for enough'sauce' but it is so flavorful and it was indeed enough. I did, however, deglaze the pan after cooking the pork with about 1/4 cup of chicken stock because the spices got concentrated on the bottom of the pan. That didn't create more'sauce' because it evaporated - just wanted to get the good bits off the bottom of the pan. But that I used leftover pork roast (cubed up) instead of ground pork. I also used more liquid aminos instead of the soy sauce and added another tablespoon (it needed more of that ingredient in my mind). Next time I make it I will probably use 2 oz. of the noodles instead of 4 (just personal preference - I would like more cabbage ratio than noodle). I did add one egg towards the end and scrambled it in the pan - didn't need it necessarily but I liked the added richness it provided. I added some chopped cilantro on top as I served it. This is a keeper and for me that's a big deal. I rarely go by recipes but I followed this one to the T and it was great. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Really needed more sauce. I added half a jar of orange sauce to it. Otherwise it would have been very bland. Will probably not make again.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#So easy and quick to make and very good tasting! I used pre-packaged coleslaw mix to save time. This recipe is a definite keeper, and all my family, even my picky eaters, have requested me to make it again!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#So simple and delicious! I substituted leftover pan-fried tofu and one lightly scrambled egg in place of the ground pork, used pre-packaged coleslaw mix and about 1.5 cups of shredded carrot and then topped off the finished produce with a sprinkling of peanuts and Sriracha sauce. I love someone's idea of using spicy mustard and/or sweet and sour sauce in the future! Will definitely be making this again! 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Didn't taste much like an Egg Roll but did have really nice flavors. I used the slaw mix as someone suggested. This was easy to make for a week night meal. Not a lot of soy sauce so good on sodium. Will make again. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Quick, easy, healthy and delicious!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Made this last night to bring for lunch today. It was awesome! I used Cole slaw mix and will be using that from now on. Turned out just perfect.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#I also decied that coleslaw was the way to go. Unfortunately the Vietnamese egg rolls my sister-in- law taught me how to make use a rice thread noodle , so that's what I thought this recipe was calling for. Pretty sure they're not the same. Still it has great flavor. But I am also thinking maybe a side of fried wonton would make it a 5 star. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Made this for our family dinner. the three of us gave it as a keeper. I did substitute coleslaw mix for the cabbage, and the two large carrots were a bit too much, will cut those back a bit. This goes in our file of keepers, I am on a somewhat restricted diet following heart surgery, left out the salt and used low sodium soy sauce. Cargram, my mom used the sweet & sour sauce, she was very pleased with all, but she did request fried wonton wrappers next time ??
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Looks like a good recipe for me to try. For those who think something is missing~~I wonder if it isn't because egg rolls are usually served with a mustard or sweet sauce, so perhaps some of one or the other might either be added or served on the side. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Genius! I too don't want the trouble of making them besides I want to know what I'm eating 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#So easy, delicious, and lower in fat than fried egg rolls too. I cut up some cooked salad shrimp and tossed them in as well. Great recipe!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#We really enjoyed this dish. It has great flavor and is quick and easy to make. Thanks for sharing.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#We love this recipe. I've made it a couple times now....the second time, I'cheated' and used coleslaw mix. It worked great! 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#I ground my own pork to make this dish and it was worth it!! Very tasty!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Made this for dinner tonight and my husband devoured all of it! I served it with hot mustard and Hoisin sauce on the side. It was simple and quick to make, especially since I used fresh coleslaw mix, which saved me the task of shredding cabbage and carrots. Great recipe, a keeper - thanks for sharing it, Courtney!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Very good flavor. I didn't put in the turmeric...mainly because I don't think turmeric does anything but change a dish a very odd color. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#This recipe is definitely a keeper - added red chili flakes, extra garlic, and some rice vinegar at the end - very good but will add a few crunchy noodles as garnish!! Nummy num nums!!!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#This is a very enjoyable recipie that is reminiscent of egg rolls, without the rolling and frying. It is a perfect recipe if a single person wants to bring an easy lunch with them for a few days and is balanced with veggies and protein. The only thing is that it feels like it is missing something. Egg rolls aren't the most flavorful to begin with, and I don't know if for my taste if more garlic, ginger, onion or soy sauce needs added. Nonetheless, a very good and simple recipie for my cooking arsenal. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Definitely love the concept, but the flavor was not quite right, needs a little more spice. Next time I make it (and I will make again) I will try some red pepper flakes to see if that helps. Thank your Courtney for sharing your recipe.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Always looking for gluten free recipes. Hubby has celiac. This is so quick and easy. Very simple to adjust as you like. Doubled the recipe, glad I did. Thanks so much!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#This is a keeper in my house. I used chicken and changed the noodles to chinese flour noodles. This was a great dish.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#This sounds very close to the recipe I created for my fried egg rolls. Making a bowl of noodles is a great idea. It is time consuming to roll and fry. I have also rolled and then baked egg rolls. They are very good and of course, no oily mess. Spray them with cooking spray, or even paint a thin layer of oil, on all sides. Bake at 350 degrees until lightly browned. I gave a five star rating, even though I haven't used this recipe, since it does sound so close to mine, which is delicious of course!! 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#I didn't have rice noodles, so I used a package of Ramen noodles (without the seasoning packet), and no green onions. My husband suggested adding some broth and making it a soup, but the rest of us didn't think that was necessary. We all really enjoyed it. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Although this is a really good recipe, I was taken aback at the title. I was expecting actual egg noodles not rice noodles. I love them both so I will try each of them. Egg noodles have so much flavor and I think they would be the perfect addition. I have been cooking for many many years and I can honestly say this recipe is a keeper. : )
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Love it! The recipe is perfect the way it is- the hardest part for me is finding ground pork that isn't frozen if I don't plan far enough ahead. The leftovers are just as good as well, and I've eaten it cold as well. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Both my husband & I loved this! I had ramen rice noodles, so I used those. I also substituted fresh grated ginger instead of ground ginger. My husband added hoisin sauce to his dish, while I added a few additional shakes of soya sauce. This will now be in our regular rotation - thanks Courtney!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Loved it! Had to use fettuccini rather than rice noodles. It's a keeper! 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#1#Excellent! This reminded my husband of his favorite dish at a fast food noodle restaurant. I liked it because I could control the ingredients and the cost per serving was a fraction of the restaurant price! The only changes I made were to add a bit more soy sauce to suit our tastes, and to use sliced boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of ground pork. I think you could use any protein and get a great result. This has been declared a top 5 favorite meal in our house!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Awesome! If you are looking for a fast recipe that is also light and quick, this is it. I made as written. Family requested to make again.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Not a bad recipe, and very easy to make. I couldn't find rice noodles, so I used Japanese wheat noodles. If I make it again, I would add more ginger and remove the turmeric. My husband didn't care for it, unfortunately. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#A very simple and delicious recipe. Make this recipe once and you will never forget how quick, and easy it is ! From pan to the table in no time at all. I cut a few corners by using store bought coleslaw. It worked just fine. I also had no rice noodles so I broke up a handful of thin spaghetti * That also worked just fine. Winner indeed!JanieTaste of Home Volunteer Food Editor
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#This is truly a simple and delicious recipe! It's definitely a keeper. I added one ingredient...hot chili pepper because we are big fans of heat. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#I loved this! Incredibly easy and the flavors are incredible. I love egg rolls and this was a great way to get the flavor without making them myself. I did not use the sesame oil, but coconut instead, and found a coleslaw mix at the store with preshredded cabbage and carrots. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. My bag of rice noodles had the option to fry or boil the noodles, so I assumed that boiling was the option preferred foe the recipe. Will be making it again!
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#1#Loved this hearty, one-bowl, veggie-packed dish. Made a wonderful weeknight supper for my husband and me. We both enjoyed it and will definitely be making it again. I doubled the recipe and I have to admit that my big ol' hubby and I ate the whole thing. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#So quick and easy. And full of veggies! You could probably add peas too. I couldn't find ground pork so used ground turkey and it worked well. Even my super-picky three year-old loved this. 
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#Great recipe and great flavor - thanks.
Egg Roll Noodle Bowl#0#0#I have made this twice. The first time with ground pork and the second time with ground chicken. Both times it was great! I am even thinking about doing chopped up shrimp. Makes great leftovers. I might try taking some sliced and baked won ton wrappers to add to the top for some crunch. I sent leftovers with my husband with some Chinese mustard for his lunch and he loved it. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#My family loves this cake. I have already made it 4 times. Thanks for sharing!!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#4#0#I made this recipe today and used Mindy266 cream cheese frosting. My wife said the cake was good, the frosting was good, together they were wonderful!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#6#0#This is our favorite strawberry cake recipe, thanks for sharing! The frosting was a bit sweeter than we like, so this time I made a whipped strawberry cream cheese frosting. Whipped a 1/2 cup of heavy cream in a cold mixing bowl, in a separate bowl, I beat 1/4 cup of unsalted butter with 4 oz. of cream cheese, stirred in 1/4 cup of pureed strawberries and 1/2 tsp of vanilla, then mixed in 1 1/4 cups powdered sugar; last step was folding the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#Best strawberry cake around. I have made it, into cupcakes and into a couple loaf cakes and they come out beautiful and delicious every time!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#9#0#I bake this cake every year for my daughter's birthday (for several years, she's old, I'm not!!!) and it's always perfect and delicious. My recipe from Southern Living uses 3 - 8 pans and the batter is just the right amount for 3 pans! 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#2#0#I made this in cupcake form when someone at work requested strawberry cupcakes. They were an absolute hit! Super moist! I was even told they were better than my coworker's mother's strawberry cake. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#4#0#This was excellent. SUPER moist and so flavorful - and so easy. I doubled and made a 9x13 and six large cupcakes for a groom's cake. I iced the cupcakes with buttercream icing and did a white chocolate fondant on the cake. Outstanding! I will DEFINITLY make it again. Thank you, for sharing! 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#15#0#I made this cake for my family and it was one of my first times baking a cake! I think it is an amazing cake recipe. Everyone in my family loved it! Thanks! p.s. the recipe is a double layer cake, can this cake be made into single layer? 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#3#0#Best strawberry cake ever!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#9#1#A bit too rich for my taste. If I make it again, I think I would do a light whipped cream topping with strawberries rather than the frosting from this recipe (which just felt like *too much*).
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#13#5#I just made this for the first time. I haven't even had time to frost it or eat it, but I followed directions exactly and two 8 pans are way too small. Should be either two 9 pans or one 9 x13 pan. 8 pans made this cake take longer to bake, they overflowed, and were difficult to remove cleanly from pans. It may taste wonderful, I'll see. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#5#1#This is one of our favorite cakes to make! Perfect strawberry cake!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#4#16#Waste of time and ingredients, cake ran over never did rise, and was miserable to get out of pans, tossed it out!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#3#I can't wait to make this for Easter! It looks AHHMAZING! 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#9#5#I' m always afraid fresh strawberries contain too much liquid. Instead of chopping them, would it be wiser to smash them or put for a short pulse in a blender? 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#5#0#This was a delicious cake! It was like a breath of spring. The frosting was scrumptious. Even my husband who doesn't like frosting commented how yummy it was!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#4#1#I made this for my Grandson, he posted it on FB. I used whipped cream frosting topped with strawberries and wafer cookies. Now everyone is requesting one. They love it.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#8#7#This recipe came on boxes of Betty Crocker cake mixes back in the'50s and is one of my favorites. My Mamaw made it throughout the year using her stockpile of frozen strawberries from her summer crops. Her recipe just followed the directions on the box of strawberry cake mix then adding the strawberry gelation and strawberries. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#6#2#Delicious cake could I bake this in a bundt cake.pan?
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#3#0#My family loved it! I added a small amount of crushed dried strawberries to both the cake and frosting to boost the flavor. Family loved it!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#2#0#This is the exact same recipe that my MIL used to make strawberry cakes back in the 1960's. It was my late husband's favorite cake. It is very easy to make and is absolutely delicious. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#1#0#This is a favorite and so easy. Always comes out perfect!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#3#0#I made my daughter this cake for her birthday, and she now would like me to make it every year to celebrate her birthday. Yay. Found a cake she enjoys. Thank you. :)
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#9#1#I use this recipe so much I decided I should finally leave a review! Everyone begs me to make it for every event. Could not recommend more
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#1#0#Made this cake yesterday and it has already vanished! So simple to make and everyone enjoyed it
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#10#This is ok......but my Mamaw would NEVER use a mix!!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#3#0#I made this cake it was very delicious
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#2#0#This cake is delicious, very moist, very good strawberry flavor. Is my favorite strawberry cake of all time.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#1#0#This is a very good recipe! It looks and tastes delicious. It is a great recipe for a spring or summer gathering or company meal.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#3#0#By far the best strawberry cake I have ever had.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#3#0#The best strawberry cake I have had. It's so easy to prepare and super moist. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#3#1#DELICIOUSLY DELICIOUS! I will say the first time I made it it definitely bit my sweet tooth. The second time I made it with sugar free Jello and it brought some of the sweetness out. As for the frosting...good when chilled. Melts SUPER easily but is very yummy. I'm playing around with the frosting recipe to see if adding a premade frosting or cream cheese will help it hold. Other than that YUMMERS! 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#3#8#I wanted SO much to love this cake! The strawberry smell and taste were terrific, but the cake, with the sugar in the Jello and the cake mix was far too sweet, The frosting was almost inedible it was so sweet when eaten with the cake. We scraped the frosting off and topped each piece with a dollop of Greek yogurt, and it was delicious but would have been equally so with whipped topping or ice cream. If I were to make it again, I would probably make it from scratch and reduce the sugar, and serve it unfrosted. I added some dried strawberries which I had processed (a couple of spoonful) to enhance the strawberry flavor
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#1#I made this for Mother's Day 2 years ago and my family requests this cake for EVERY occasion now! We have 2 diabetics in our house, so I used sugar free cake mix, sugar free gelatin and sugar substitute and it's still delicious. The cake is moist and well flavored...I've even used a sugar free frosting and added in chopped strawberries for the diabetics. This cake is just brilliant! 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#5#5#Excelllent recipe - recipe was created to sell jello. it comes from a Jello cookbook. My family has been making this cake since the 60s. So it belongs to Jello.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#I have made this 3 times to share with daughter and her family. It is absolutely incredible. We actually love to eat the cake slightly warm. Something about that with that amazing frosting just puts it over the edge for us. Love, love, love
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#5#0#I have actually had this recipe for years. We called it Strawberry Party Cake ! Absolutely amazing. Super easy and NEVER any left overs! LOVE IT! Usually put it in a 13 X9 pan. Easier to transport! 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#Made this for my little girls birthday...it was amazing! I'm not a huge cake fan or a good baker, but this turned out super moist and delicious. Everyone loved.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#1#I made this cake according to the recipe - no change! It was a HUGE hit for a family birthday - everyone loved it!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#Very easy and tasty cake. Served for a family picnic, and it was the first desert that was gone! Will make again. NOTE: it was very hot at our picnic, and the buttercream frosting didn't hold up well, and rolled down the cake. Next time I serve for a summer picnic, I will adjust the frosting... however the frosting tasted wonderful. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#1#0#Can this cake be frozen?
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#10#https://pakrealestatenews.wordpress.com/2019/07/29/plot-for-sale-in-naval-anchorage/
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#Make this and it's so delicious. Thank you for the recipe! It's easy to remember because I have a g daughter Emily.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#2#0#I made it in a 9x13 pan easy to bake and take
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#1#0#For those having trouble with the cake not baking properly it's probably due to the fact that boxed cake mixes have gotten smaller since this recipe was first published in 2013. Try reducing the water by a quarter cup or the strawberries by a quarter cup. Some experimenting may be needed to get the proper ratio. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#I have been looking for a strawberry cake recipe similar to the one my mother used to make to no avail. Mamaw must be the right age as this recipe is spot on. Ha loads of real strawberry flavor. My family went nuts for it. They said it was even better than the best bakery in town.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#4#0#Absolutely delicious and definitely nostalgic. I made this last night and it came out perfect! I followed the recipe exactly without any issues. I used two round Nonstick pans. It's a pretty cake as well as tasty! It's a recipe my mother (R.I P. 9-2018) made and was requested often at family gatherings. I thought of her with many fond memories while making it. Looks like I'll be carrying on the tradition now. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#2#1#First time I made this I had similar problems as others have had. Made it in 2 8 round cake pans-I had a hard time getting it baked all the way -had to keep adding extra time. The icing was not as thick as I would've liked but didn't want to make it too sweet by adding more powdered sugar. This time I baked in 3 8 pans and bake time was 18 min at 350 degrees. Used the recommended 2 oz of cream cheese and drained the pureed strawberries for icing-PERFECTION! Either was the cake is absolutely delicious! Kept in the refrigerator as a cool dessert with this hot summer heat. This is will definitely be in my recipe book for life! 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#I've made a similar recipe before and it called for 3-8 pans, not 2. Using 2, it took almost 20 minutes longer to bake than recipe time. I used aluminum pans. Also, ingredients we're missing from main list and only mentioned in video. Other than that, it's tasty and still moist with extra baking time. I did like folding in chopped berries to cake instead of using mixer. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#2#0#I just made this and it is VERY good. Unfortunately I did not have small pans so I made it in a bunt cake pan and I failed. It was so moist it fell apart. I'm not a baker so I'm sure I did something wrong. So we had a deconstructed cake for mother's day lol. Tastes amazing. The butter cream was the best ever! 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#I made the cake twice as directed, and the taste was fantastic, but it collapsed. So I made it as a sheet cake and have gotten rave reviews from my co-workers. Tastes delicious!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#1#0#What a wonderful cake! Easy to make and just delicious! The addition of fresh strawberries in the batter added so much fresh flavor, and the strawberry buttercream frosting is just wonderful. This cake is moist, delicious and packed with strawberry goodness. Its a perfect warm weather dessert when strawberries are at their peak and something I will definitely make again and again!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#I followed the recipe exactly as written. Mine turned out very moist and would not hold together. Not sure what I did wrong. The taste is good. I made sure the toothpick came out clean. My husband thinks it did not bake long enough. I was wondering if I cut the strawberries too small and had too many. The frosting was fine using almost 5 cups of sugar.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#3#1#This cake was delicious! I made a sheet cake instead of a layer cake so it took a good 15 minutes or so longer to cook. The cake was still super moist! I also drained the crushed strawberries before adding them to the icing and added 4 ounces of cream cheese as some suggested - perfection! I will definitely be making this one again!!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#1#0#I had to toss the cake in the garbage. It didn't bake all the way, I tried to add some time, but that didn't work either. I have been baked for over 50 years and the only other cake I had to toss was when I was in my teens. I have no idea what I did wrong, the flavor was there but it would not setup. Good luck. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#Oh my gosh this is the best strawberry cake ever! I added 6 ounces of cream cheese to the frosting....uh...heavenly. 5 stars!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#Excellent cake! So moist and flavorful, it's hard to just stop at one piece. After reading several of the reviews, I added two ounces of cream cheese to the frosting and let the strawberries, for the frosting, sit in a strainer while the cake was baking. With making those small changes, it turned out beautiful and absolutely delicious. It is now in my permanent cake recipe file. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#This is an amazing cake! And so easy to put together!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#1#0#Great recipe. I made this cake just like the recipe says and it came out perfect. By the way I am a guy. I have been cooking for over 40 years and still use recipes more like a road map to just put me on the right track. I followed this to the letter. It was great.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#I'm definitely in the minority on with this rating but I used 8 inch cake pans and had about a cup of overflow onto the bottom of my oven. The rim of the pan was also covered with batter which made removal from the pan difficult. Followed the instructions exactly and didn't change a thing. Think I'll cut back on the amount of strawberries in the frosting to avoid a runny frosting. It's for my grand daughter's birthday and I'm hoping the frosting covers up the messy cake. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#Uber moist and full of strawberry goodness- My mom loved it!!!!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#I recently made this cake for the first time for my adult son's birthday dinner and the whole family liked it very much so we decided this recipe is a keeper. It was very moist and tasty. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#Really good!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#Love it making another one keep up the good work thank you
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#1#1#I made this cake for Valentine's Day for my co-workers and it was scrumptious. It was like having almost like ice cream it was so delicious and I chilled it and they liked it even more because it was a cold treat. I did not do the buttercream frosting I did the whipped cream version with the strawberries but it was amazing. you especially have to pay attention to cooling the cakes down before you frost it with that version. I topped it with strawberries and it just looked amazing. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#1#I really liked this recipe! i brought for a church potluck and there were no leftovers. I decorated the top with candy hearts. I loved the fresh berries in the frosting and cake, really added something special. I did not think too sweet. I made frosting as listed and softened (not melted) butter and the texture was great. I did put in frig after making until I served, maybe that was the trick? Will make again!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#Despite cutting back on the amount of added sugar, I found this cake to be too sweet, and unnaturally pink; it had an overwhelming artificial flavor. It is difficult to keep the frosting from becoming runny, no matter how well drained the strawberries are.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#This is so good. I love the strawberry flavor and it makes a very pretty cake.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#2#2#I love strawberries. This cake was moist and tasty. I put chocolate dipped strawberries all over it. It was beautiful. So the icing wasn't runny, I did make sure my butter was just softened NOT melted. I crushed the strawberries and drained all the juice I could off of them. I used 5 cups of powdered sugar. It was thin but not running. I think next time I will add softened cream cheese for a little more stability. I baked the cake about 35 minutes. It was moist and perfect. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#1#Great recipe! Quick! Used strawberriy flavored cake mix and skipped the jello. Beautiful pink color. Made 70 mini cupcakes. Baked in mini cupcake liners at 350 degrees for 13 minutes. Minis cupcakes great with frosting or alone. As volunteer feild editor with Taste of Home magazine I love recipes utilizing pantry goods with fresh seasonal fruits!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#This cake was very good, but very sweet! I do have one suggestion. Do not make the icing until you are ready to ice the cake. I made mine ahead of time, then the strawberries released there juices. When I was ready to ice, the icing was way too runny!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#3#0#Jennifer, afraid you'll have to tell your husband this was my MawMaw Benie's Strawberry Cake before it was his MawMaw Emily's. :) It could probably be called A Lotta Different MawMaw's Strawberry Cake. Hahaha! It is a wonderful cake my grandmother made many times. She always topped and decorated it with beautiful whole strawberries, by the way. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#1#I made this cake for the Fourth of July in a sheet pan because I wanted to decorate it with blueberries and raspberries for the American flag. Everyone loved it. Instead of chopping the strawberries for the cake, I just pureed them in the blender. And I made cream cheese frosting because I needed the cake to be white for the flag decoration. The cake is sweet so the cream cheese frosting definitely offsets that and really goes great with the strawberry flavor.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#2#I was very disappointed in this recipe. I haven't eaten it yet but I almost want to toss the whole thing in the trash. It looks like a disaster! I've never had a problem with recipes not turning out and bake quite often, I should have used my better judgement with this frosting and altered it but I wanted to try the recipe just as it was written to see what I thought. I wanted to surprise my husband with this cake but I'm embarrassed to show it to him, the frosting is so runny and didn't set up at all! It makes the cake look like I just dumped a liquid over the top. It looks nothing like the picture. Don't make the same mistake I did, do like many other reviewers and make your own frosting or you will just waste time and ingredients. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#Super Strawberry Cake! Will make it over and over this summer. I just made couple of changes; used 5 tbsp. self rising flour instead of 3 of all purpose (gives the cake a home-made taste) and skipped the 3 spoons of sugar. Added 8 oz cream cheese and 1/2 cup whipping cream to the icing. It was absolutely delicious! Thank you!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#When I made this recipe two months ago I put cream cheese icing on it and decorated the top with sliced strawberries to look like a rose. My family loves it and have now asked me to make a total of five times.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#2#1#Best strawberry cake ever! I made this as a birthday cake with an additional lemon cake layer per the request of my 17-year-old daughter. Moist, homemade flavor even though it's from a box and has flavored gelatin. I was skeptical, but now throughly impressed. It was a real hit! I use a good avocado oil for baking instead of canola or veg oil. I used a food chopper to chop strawberries. They were perfect! Not too fine and not too big. I used the frosting recipe - ingredients only but with different measurements, plus added cream cheese to it and made it as a filling between the layers ( not nearly as sweet that way, as others had mentioned), and frosted with White icing. I tripled this recipe and baked it in a 12 x 12 x 2 pan. Only used about 2 1/2 of the recipes instead of the full tripled amount to fill the pan. It came out perfect! I used nonstick spray on pan as well as the parchment paper and sprayed paper. Do not let cake cool completely in pan. Only cool cake about 10-15 min on a cooling rack. Took a knife and wen along the edges of the pan to release any possibly stuck sides. I noticed that the gelatin with the sugar may stick a little bit, but it's not bad. Then placed another piece of parchment paper on the top of the cake, placed cooling rack on top of the cake and while holding both cooling rack and pan flipped cake over and let it sit for a moment. Shook gently. Removed pan. Nothing stuck! Just a thought, but usually can't go wrong when a cake recipe begins with Mamaw. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#I made this last weekend. I used strawberry cake mix instead of white. Crushed strawberries I used in cool whip in place of the frosting, and put in the fridge, delicious!!!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#Cake is very good, but will fall due to the weight of the strawberries. This icing recipe is extremely sweet and doesn't set up, so next time I will use a frosting recipe with cream cheese. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#The cake recipe is a winner BUT skip the icing, it way too sweet. I wish I had read the reviews before I dove into this one. The cake recipe came out great and can see adapting this with other combos of jello and fruit, maybe lime :) The icing didn't do it for me, others suggested a cream cheese icing would work much better. Icing out the tub or even cool whip would be better that the suggested icing. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#1#0#Practically the same recipe as ours. I wonder why she put in extra flour and sugar. We don't. Also I use 4 eggs. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#Made this delicious cake for a naranon meeting and it disappeared in minutes. Thank you for this wonderful recipe. I am making it again for mother's day. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#My husband went through the first in two days Came home today with the cake mix , jello and strawberries for a repeat please!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#THIS is amazing. Super moist and flavorful. Strawberry buttercream! I'm putting some on my cookies for Valentine's Day! 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#1#I made this last year for my daughters birthday,she and everyone else loved it. It was so easy to make. I used cool whip frosting and added red food coloring and some fresh chopped strawberries. It was a big hit with my family. I will make it again this year for my husbands and my anniversary. It is so good!! Lala from Nashville
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#h my gosh this is one of the best cakes I've made. Very tasty and moist. I didn't make the frosting but next time I will. This will go with my favorite recipes 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#1#0#Wonderful Recipe! I made a 13 * 9 and baked it about 26 minutes. The only change I made was to the frosting. I used mashed strawberries In a heavy syrup instead of crushed fresh strawberries. I wanted more strawberry flavor and this was perfect. Creamed the butter and a tablespoon of the strawberries then beat in powdered sugar. Added small amounts of strawberries until i got the right consistency desired. Served the cake with a really good vanilla ice cream and dribbled a little of the remaining strawberry syrup concoction over the top. People made themselves miserable with second servings.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#I made this for a baby shower, but as cupcakes not a tiered cake. Baked them at 350 for about 25 min. Also, I used a whipped cream icing instead of a buttercream (the same recipe as the Snow Globe cake here on Taste of Home, with about 1/4 tsp added strawberry flavour) and they tasted like strawberries and cream. Got tons of rave reviews from everybody at the shower. ?? 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#Thank you for sharing, Jennifer. It is a keeper.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#Sounds delicious.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#1#I started making this 46 years ago. It was called Strawberry Jello Cake. Used no sugar or flour. Just cake mix, strawberry jello, 3 eggs, oil, water and 10 oz bag of frozen strawberries. Separate strawberries from juice (save juice for glaze). Baked in 13 x 9 pan. For glaze, 1 16 oz bag powdered sugar, little melted butter and strawberry juice. Mix and pour over cooled cake. Take a fork and poke cake all over before pouring glaze.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#A deliciously fabulous cake - a real family favorite! Made it for my own 3-tiered wedding cake, and every last bite was gone!!
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#I made this for Easter lunch and it was a huge hit! My brother thought it was a recipe that belonged to our mother.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#I almost cried when I made this for Easter and took the first bite as it was just like my mother, grandmother and aunt all made for me as a child. It is a delicious, moist, very strawberry cake. Truly, if you like strawberries you will like this. My only change was I used 3/4 cup oil and 3/4cup water instead of as stated. Also, it took me 5 cups of 10x sugar.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#This cake is delicious! I made cup cakes though and I used coconut oil. The cake is so moist. The frosting is fantastic! I used 5 cups of powered sugar but it doesn't taste real sweet. Every time my husband eats a cup he comments how great they taste. Tonight he said don't loose the recipe. He also said I should make some for his office.Spring is coming so the fresh strawberries will be plentiful and so will the cakes or cups.Thank yo for sharing, Jennifer. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#1#0#This is wonderfully moist and rich in strawberry flavor. My husband, a chef, even loved it. He said it is a keeper. Thank you for sharing this recipe.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#2#For bakebread, ap=all purpose flourAm tired of all the negative ratings from people that haven't made the recipe. Thanks for the cake fix, shrinkage makes me nuts too, but get a grip people! This is a refreshing, fresh tasting, moist cake. I did not make the frosting, but the cake is a keeper. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#bBrandel, could you please tell me what ap flours .. Sorry to be so ignorant but not sure what the aberrations is for.. Thank you in advance. Plus thank you so much for sharing the fix for older recipes adaption to current ones. Gave it 5 because it sounds just like what my son will enjoy for his BD.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#1#0#Because the cake mixes have reduced weights, make an addition to bring the mix up to the old weight. Mix 1 1/2 cups ap flour, 1 cup sugar, 2 tsps. baking powder and 1/4 tsp. baking soda. Place mixture into a ziplock or jar. When making a cake, add 6 T. of the mixture to the box mix and proceed as needed. Store the rest of the mixture until you make another cake.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#I've been making this cake for years and is a family favorite. Yes, the frosting can get a little messy. I usually have to cut back a little on the juice from the strawberries or add more powdered sugar. I also store it in the refrigerator so the frosting stays firmer. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#I want to try this, but I would like to know if anyone has used sugar free jello and Splenda to cut down on the sugar and how it turned out. I am diabetic.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#This is a delicious cake! Moist and very flavorful.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#This cake taste great! Super moist. Only thing, is that the juice from strawberries adds to the liquid in the batter... so it was a tad bit messy. It's OK I covered it with the frosting lol! I made this cake for my sister-in-law's b-day. I only used cake recipe, because I made a chocolate-covered strawberries cake. I made a chocolate pudding filling with left over strawberries. The frosting I made a cocoa whipped cream one. Then placed almonds on the side of the cake. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#The cake is wonderful. The frosting is a mess. Next time I will make cream cheese or buttercream frosting and add diced strawberries to it to it.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#This is a very good cake. For potlucks & large gatherings, I make it in a 9 x 13 pan. I use cream cheese frosting instead of butter cream, and I decorate with fresh strawberry halves.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#This is a really good strawberry cake recipe. We have liked this one as at least one of the best. We have one comment and that is we use more strawberries than this one calls for. Its everyone's taste buds. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#My heavens, most of you people act like this is some new invention. This recipe has been around for about 40 years. It's a good enough cake, but I have adapted mine to scratch rather than using cake mix. Much better. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#If this cake is made right--you will always receive rave reviews. I've made this cake for years alternating a Golden Cake Mix /White Cake Mix. It will fall if too much fluid is added via strawberries. Love it! For those that change the ingredients and process--why review here?Begin a new recipe. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#1#This is the only birthday cake that my daughter has accepted since she was 16 and she is in her 40's. My Mother made it for her the first time and we have kept the tradition going. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#I make mine just like this, but use cream cheese instead of butter in the frosting.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#My daughter and I have both requested it for our birthday .mine is June 3 .so we used fresh strawberries (2 cups) anyone who doesn't like this cake is not a strawberry lover. I didn't make the frosting. Whip cream and more strawberries on top is all it needed. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#Family didn't care for it. I thought it was just okay. Won't make again. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#I tried this recipe for the first time. I used 2 egg whites, rather than the 2 eggs. I also baked this in 2 greased and floured 8 square pans for 35 minutes-I used a cake tester to determine whether the cakes were done! I'd used 3 Tbsp. of the cake mixture to mix in with the chopped strawberries. Instead of using a strawberry icing, I used 2 cups of confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup lemon juice (bottled) and the 1/2 cup crushedstrawberries. I'd pricked holes in each cake with a fork and then drizzled the glaze over each cake. The cakes certainly ARE moist! The feedback on this cake from other readers is also VERY helpful! I think that if I made the icing again, I will concentrate on that! I've made cakes using Jello and I often resort to making a lemon glaze or other citrus-type glaze which runs down into the baked cake, making it extra moist! When I added the water in the amount specified, I added it slowly to the batter! delowenstein 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#1#0#This cake has a really good taste. I made mine in a 9x13 pan, so I did have to bake 5mins. longer. I also didn't need all the icing & I only used 4C. powdered sugar. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#This Strawberry Cake has been a family favorite since 1962. Have past it on to several family members through the years.
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#I received endless compliments on this cake. I used firmer strawberries so the cake held up for several days and I added a thin layer of strawberry jam with the frosting between the layers. I kept the cake in the refrigerator and it was real easy to cut. My husband said it's a keeper recipe! 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#This cake was delicious and so moist! I didn't need all the sugar called for in the frosting, so would recommend starting with 3 cups and then add more if/as needed. I somewhat pureed the strawberries used in the frosting as well. It got rave reviews from my family so thank you for sharing this recipe...it's a definite keeper 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#0#0#I just made this too. It is wonderful. As for the frosting, I wish I had made it thicker. It's a tad messy cutting into it. I will take nopalito's suggestion and put it in the fridge. 
Mamaw Emily's Strawberry Cake#1#0#OMG, you must make this cake. I made it for my strawberry-crazy daughter-in-law and it has supplanted her previous favorite. I am not too fond of strawberries, but this is going on my favorites list. I need to think about the frosting. Think I'll use the recipe frosting between the layers and then use a thinner version more as a glaze. It sure makes a generous portion. Also, this cake is better the next day or at least well-chilled. TRY IT AND YOU'LL BE HAPPY!!!
